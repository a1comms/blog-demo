<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Someone just&nbsp;created iPhone lattes, the ultimate beverage for tech-loving hipsters.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, lattes have certainly come a long, long way. First there was the plain and simple milky coffee. It was well loved, but people wanted something different. Something against the trend.</p>
<p>Then came the avocado latte, the unicorn latte, even the dragon latte&hellip; They were tasty and eccentric but none of these weirdly wonderful drinks can hold a candle to the latest latte sweeping the world by storm.</p>

<p>Dubbed &lsquo;the perfect marriage of technology and latte art,&rsquo; the good guys at Mashable recently created a beverage that we can all get behind (particularly if you&rsquo;re an Apple fan, who loves tight hipster jeans and oiling their beard).</p>
<p>Enter the iPhone latte. This drink is rather simple, comprising of your standard espresso-based latte, crowned with an Apple logo, and, of course, served in an iPhone box.</p>

<h2>How to Make Your Own iPhone Latte</h2>
<p>If this drink sounds like it matches your edgy personality, you may well be wondering how to create one for yourself. Well, never fear. Mashable has come up with a step-by-step guide to help you get the latte of your iPhone dreams. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p><strong>1) Find a Suitable&nbsp;iPhone Box</strong></p>
<p>So, will you be making a <em>tall</em>, <em>grande</em> or <em>venti</em> sized iPhone latte? Or to you and me, small, medium or large. iPhone 4 and 5 boxes will make for the perfect small, while iPhone 6 and 7 boxes will likely work for your medium lattes. Then your Plus variant boxes will suit for a large.</p>
<p><strong>2) Find an Authentic Barista</strong></p>
<p>Since decent coffee is huge business right now, you should have no trouble finding yourself an authentic barista. Just nip down to your favourite cafe and ask them to do you a big favour. Sure, they might ask you to repeat the question, then point you towards the door, but if you find a barista that&rsquo;s free spirited enough, you might be in luck.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you own a decent coffee machine, feel free pull your own espresso and foam up some milk at home.</p>
<p><strong>3) Watch the Magic Happen</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it, latte art takes some serious skills. You might think those little hearts and leaves that appear in your coffee are simple to create. Well, you&rsquo;re wrong. It takes a steady hand, a creative brain, and a whole load of patience. An Apple logo? Even more demanding. But a talented barista, like the one in Mashable&rsquo;s video, will handle it no problem.</p>
<p><strong>4) Capture the Moment</strong></p>
<p>Finally, once you have your iPhone latte prepped, it&rsquo;s all about capturing the moment. If ever there were a truly Instagram-able drink, it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s sat in an iPhone box.</p>
<p><em>Note:&nbsp;We think filling your iPhone box with coffee is a terrible idea. If you can&rsquo;t resist, at least make sure it&rsquo;s empty.</em></p>
