<p><span class="postStandFirst">As we get closer to Christmas, it&rsquo;s time to think about where to get those high-tech gifts you want to buy for your loved ones (or, of course, yourself). And so, it&rsquo;s time to introduce you to the new buymobiles Tech Shop, for all your consumer technology needs!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6105" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/landing-page-xmas-banner-1024x175.jpg" alt="landing-page-xmas-banner" width="960" height="164" /></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever looked at our range of free gifts available with a new smartphone, and thought to yourself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a new phone right now, I wish I could get one of those gifts on its own?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well now you can as our new Tech Shop is live in time for Christmas!</strong></p>
<p>In our Tech Shop, you&rsquo;ll find some of the best-selling and most awesome consumer technology known to man, and all of it is now available as standalone items (although, of course, if you do want to get a new phone as well, we&rsquo;ve also got a cracking good selection of deals available). Whether you&rsquo;re looking for an iPad Air 2 or an iPad Mini 3, a new Xbox One or a PlayStation 4, a new HP 250 laptop or a Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, an LG HD Ready TV or a set of top-end Beats headphones, you&rsquo;ll find them all available in the Tech Shop.</p>
<p>So, how do you grab yourself a bargain on these technological wonders? Well, you have two options, although both of them start, naturally, by heading over to the Tech Shop.</p>
<p>Once there, just pick out the item you want, and then, you have two options for how to pay; you can either pay the one-off price to grab yourself a bargain, or, if money&rsquo;s a bit tight and you want to spread the load out, you can also buy on interest free credit, and pay for the item in easy monthly installments!</p>
<p><strong>So, for those last minute presents, or just to treat <em>yourself</em>, visit the buymobiles Tech Shop today!</strong></p>
