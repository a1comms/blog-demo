<p><span class="postStandFirst">The option to make and receive voice calls has&nbsp;arrived on WhatsApp. While it&rsquo;s just on Android phones for now, and while the developers are still tweaking the call quality, WhatsApp is finally evolving into a full-on competitor for the likes of Skype.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6465 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/playstore.jpg" alt="<img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/playstore.jpg" alt="WhatsApp now supports voice calls>" width="1024" height="500" /></p>
<p>WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, is one of the most popular apps in the smartphone industry, and now, it&rsquo;s in the process of becoming even better: slowly but surely, WhatsApp is adding VoIP services to its chat client.</p>
<p>Yes, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/31/whatsapp-voice-calling-android/">Engadget</a>, WhatsApp will now let you make voice calls.</p>
<p>Well, assuming you&rsquo;re using an Android phone like Samsung Galaxy S6 or HTC One M9, that is, because the new service has only been rolled out to Android phones so far.</p>
<p>However, the feature <em>will</em> be added in to the iOS version, so, very soon, you&rsquo;ll be able to get in on the action as well, if you&rsquo;re using iPhone 6.</p>
<p>So, how does it work?</p>
<p>As you might expect (and if you&rsquo;ve used Skype on a smartphone, you&rsquo;ll have a fair idea of how such things work), it&rsquo;s very simple indeed.</p>
<p>The latest version of WhatsApp has the feature included (although you <em>may</em> need to update through WhatsApp&rsquo;s website, as the updated version on Google Play isn&rsquo;t confirmed as having the feature working), and what it does is add a tab next to &ldquo;Contacts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chats&rdquo;, unsurprisingly labelled &ldquo;Calls&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It also adds a little call icon, and tapping that lets you call anyone on your WhatsApp contact list. Early reports say that the call quality isn&rsquo;t brilliant, but at least the feature now <em>exists</em>; now it&rsquo;s out there, the developers can work on perfecting the quality.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp is continually evolving, as all software does, and now, it appears to be evolving into a viable rival to Skype. It will be very interesting to see how this one plays out! </strong></p>
