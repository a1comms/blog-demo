<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">About time you unfriended Facebook? Here&rsquo;s how.</span></p>
<p>For the most part, we have a love-hate relationship with Facebook. Sure, it&rsquo;s an easy way to stay in touch with people, snoop on your exes, and find out the latest news. But it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of Facebook is the fact it&rsquo;s just so damn addictive. If you&rsquo;re prone to procrastination - many of us are - you could easily spend hours of your day idly scrolling through Facebook&rsquo;s newsfeed. Leaving life&rsquo;s other demands untended to.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that enough is enough, it could be time to deactivate your account <em>for good</em>. There are actually two ways that you can shut down your Facebook - one is a temporary solution; the other is oh-so-permanent.</p>
<h2>How to Deactivate Your Facebook Account... Temporarily</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not quite ready to deactivate your account for good, but would like to dial down temptation, you can deactivate it temporarily. In just a few super-simple steps, you can close down you account and get on with your social-media-free-existence. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<p>1) On PC, click the arrow positioned top right of the screen. On mobile, tap the menu icon represented by three horizontal lines.</p>
<p>2) On PC, go to Settings. On mobile, go to Settings > Account Settings.</p>
<p>3) Next, go to Security.</p>
<p>4) On PC, at the bottom of the settings now visible, click Edit (under Deactivate your account), followed by Deactivate your account. On mobile, tap Deactivate (under Account), and enter your password to continue the deactivation.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve followed the above steps, you just have to go through a few questions before confirming. It really is that easy.</p>
<p>So, what happens when you deactivate your account temporarily? Well, it means that you&rsquo;ll no longer be visible to other Facebook users. Plus, you won&rsquo;t appear in Facebook searches, so no new friend requests. There is <em>some </em>information that may still be visible to people, like old messages sent from your account.</p>

<h2>How to Reactivate Your Facebook Account</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all very well and good, but what if you just can&rsquo;t cope without Facebook in your life anymore? What if, the hole it leaves is one that you will just never be able to fill? Well, don&rsquo;t panic. If you suddenly decide that it&rsquo;s time to return, tail between your legs, there&rsquo;s an easy way to do so.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t have to create a new account. I mean, who wants the hassle of re-adding all your friends, right? Instead, you can reactivate your account at any time simply by logging back in.</p>
<h2>How to Delete Your Facebook Account... Permanently</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 100% sure that you&rsquo;re never going to want to use Facebook again, this one&rsquo;s for you. You can permanently delete your account in just a few easy steps. After, you&rsquo;ll be eradicated from Facebook entirely, unable to find a trace of anything you&rsquo;ve shared on Facebook again. Eek.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: You will <em>not </em>be able to reactivate your account after you do this! </strong></p>
<p>First, you might want to download a copy of your information from Facebook. After all, there could be important messages and photos etc. you will want to refer back to at some point. It&rsquo;s well worth having just in case. Simply go to &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; then click the link at the bottom of the page that says &lsquo;Download a copy of your Facebook data.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, and you&rsquo;re finally ready to take the plunge, visit this page to delete your Facebook account <em>forever</em>. You should know that it could take up to 90 days for Facebook to actually wipe everything on your profile. After that, though, it will be gone for good.</p>
