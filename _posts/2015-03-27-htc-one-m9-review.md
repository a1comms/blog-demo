<p><span class="postStandFirst">Join us as we take a look at HTC&rsquo;s newest flagship, HTC One M9. Does it live up to the legacy laid out by last year&rsquo;s HTC One M8? Can it compete with the wide range of other superphones on the market? Read on to find out...</span></p>
<p>HTC One M8&nbsp;was one of the most compelling superphones of 2014, with a range of features that really set it apart from its rivals. However, it&rsquo;s now 2015, so it&rsquo;s time for a new HTC flagship; it&rsquo;s time, in fact, for&nbsp;HTC One M9.</p>
<p>But how good is it? Is HTC One M9 a worthy successor to One M8? Does it still offer the same glorious fusion of awesome power and supermodel looks?</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no two ways about it: HTC One M9 is, just like its predecessor, a seriously good-looking phone. It comes clad in the same premium metal body as One M8, and the result is as beautiful as it was in 2014. What makes it look unique when compared to rival phones by Samsung&nbsp;or&nbsp;LG, however, are the&nbsp;<em>stripes</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, the back of HTC One M9 is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;designed as one flat surface; instead, it has two stripes, made of polycarbonate, running round the top and bottom of the phone. It&rsquo;s a unique design feature, and it&rsquo;s one that gives HTC One M9 something of a more futuristic look. It&rsquo;s a look that is uniquely, gorgeously &ldquo;<em>HTC-ish</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>The supermodel looks are enhanced further by the screen; HTC One M9 has a 5-inch Super-LCD3 screen, capable of displaying 16 million colours (so expect rich, varied colours).</p>
<p>The resolution comes in at 1080 x&nbsp;1920 pixels, and while that&rsquo;s obviously not as high as the Quad-HD screen on, say,&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S6, it&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>still a lovely, sharp display (and with a slightly lower resolution than that big rival, the screen should draw slightly less power from the battery, leading to a bit of an increase in standby time).</p>
<p>At the same time, the Super-LCD3 nature of the screen gives it a really wide viewing angle, to the point where you can almost see the screen when you look at it sideways. In short, and since it&rsquo;s also clad in Gorilla Glass 4 (making it&nbsp;<em>incredibly</em>&nbsp;hard-wearing), the screen on HTC One M9 is a winner!</p>

<p>So, HTC One M9 is gorgeous, but is it&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;powerful? Does it have the brains to match its beauty?</p>
<p>Well quite frankly, the answer to both those questions is a big fat&nbsp;<em>yes</em>; if one were to take apart HTC One M9 (which wouldn&rsquo;t be a good idea, mind you, so don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;do that), one would find an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor inside.</p>
<p>What that&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;means is that the processor is made of two quad-core processors (one clocked to 1.5GHz, the other clocked to 2GHz) fused together.</p>
<p>So, essentially, the processor is lightning fast when you&rsquo;re actually doing something with the phone (with the speed boosted even further by the 3GB of RAM), but very power-efficient (thus increasing the standby time) when you&rsquo;re&nbsp;<em>not</em>, thanks to it only using the higher-power chip when needed.</p>
<p>Combine that with the speed and responsiveness improvements in Android 5.0 Lollipop, and you get an incredible, ultra-responsive user experience; once you then factor in HTC&rsquo;s own UI tweaks (such as the BlinkFeed front-end), the user experience goes from just ultra-responsive, to ultra-responsive&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;actually useful.</p>
<p>In short, HTC One M9 is absolutely brilliant to use!</p>

<p>Finally, we come to the big area where HTC One M9 differs from its predecessor.</p>
<p>Where HTC One M8 had a 4 UltraPixel Duo Camera on the back,&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;phone has gone back to a more traditional 20.7-megapixel camera, suggesting that HTC has looked at the market, and that the market seems to be saying it wants a rock solid, high resolution camera instead of one that can do magical focus-changing trickery after the photo&rsquo;s been taken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great 20.7-megapixel camera, too, as it also comes with HDR (High Dynamic Rage) and a dual-LED flash, letting you take gorgeous photos, even in surprisingly dim lighting conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the front of the phone where things get most interesting, however, as that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll now find the 4 UltraPixel camera. It makes a lot more sense to put it there, frankly; UltraPixel technology is designed to capture more light, and since the front &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; camera doesn&rsquo;t have a flash, tech that lets it capture more light&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;a flash is an absolute godsend!</p>
<p>The rear camera will also capture 4K (i.e. super-<em>super</em>-high-resolution) video, and that helps highlight one of other great features of the HTC One M9: it has stereo speakers on the front, so sound playback is going to be absolutely superb, even without headphones!</p>

<p>So, is HTC One M9 a worthy successor to HTC&rsquo;s 2014 flagship? Well quite simply, yes, it is. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous, supremely smartphone that&rsquo;s packed with great features, and while there are a couple of areas where it could be more competitive against its rivals (the 1080p screen being one), it&rsquo;s still one of the best smartphones currently on the market.</p>
