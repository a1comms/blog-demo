<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony is stealing the show at the IFA 2014 in Berlin, after announcing no less than three new additions to its Xperia smartphone range. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Sony Xperia Z3, Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and the Sony Xperia E3.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-5041 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/01_Xperia_Z3_White_Group.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia Z3 and Sony Xperia Z3 Compact" width="461" height="461" /><span class="caption">Image: Sony Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact</span></p>
<p>The important thing to note here, is much in the same way as Sony Xperia Z1 and Z1 Compact mirrored each other in terms of specs, though not in size, Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact do so, too.</p>
<p>In other words, Xperia Z3 Compact is equipped with all of the same fantastic features and top-draw specifications as the full-sized version, however, they have been artfully condensed into a more <em>compact</em> body. The clue&rsquo;s in the name, see.</p>
<p>Kunimasa Suzuki, President &amp; CEO of Sony Mobile Communications, points out that size isn&rsquo;t indicative of performance, &ldquo;At Sony Mobile, &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; now means offering a choice to consumers of enjoying a large screen Xperia Z3 for immersive entertainment or a more compact, lighter Xperia Z3 Compact that doesn&rsquo;t ask you to compromise on features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about Sony Xperia E3, which is more or less an entry-level smartphone with a top-end look and feel. It embodies everything that&rsquo;s great about the Sony Xperia range, with the added delight of a rather modest price tag.</p>
<p>Calum MacDougall, a Director at Sony Mobile Communications, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to introduce Xperia E3, a handset that matches the form and function at an affordable price point. E3 combines fast performance with impressive features, all wrapped in our flagship Z series design that you can be proud to show off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that the veil has been pulled away from these exceptional Xperia smartphones, let us take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Sony Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact both sport Sony&rsquo;s winning, customary glass panel design, which is further complimented by an aluminium frame with soft, chamfered edges.</p>
<p>The full-sized Xperia Z3 and smaller Z3 Compact measure in a thickness of 7.3mm and 8.6mm respectively. Yes, Xperia Z3 Compact is ever so slightly thicker, but that&rsquo;s not at all surprising when you consider that it&rsquo;s equipped with the same flagship components at its larger counterpart. Something has to budge in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>With IP65/68 certification, both of these handsets boast the highest waterproof rating yet. So whether you&rsquo;re taking a call in the rain, or capturing photos in (or under) the pool, there&rsquo;s no cause for concern.</p>
<p>Looking at Sony Xperia E3, it&rsquo;s clear that it has borrowed some of the successful features from the Xperia Z series, as illustrated by the beautiful, slim and lightweight design. It&rsquo;s the perfect size and fit for one-handed use.</p>
<p>The rounded edges on Sony Xperia E3 have been designed to prevent scratches and ensure maximum comfort for users. The screen itself is engineered from scratch-resistant material, so you can preserve its innate beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5039 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/15113868056_6f222bf491_c1.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia Z3" width="772" height="577" /><span class="caption">Image: Sony Xperia Z3</span></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The only real difference between Sony Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact is, of course, the screen size. The larger Xperia Z3 sports a 5.2-inch Full HD display, where as the smaller variant is equipped with a 4.6-inch 720p HD display.</p>
<p>Sony has gifted both devices a TRILUMINOS screen with Live Colour LED and X-Reality for contrast enhancement, and increased visibility in bright lights. Both are fantastic for viewing videos and pictures, but you could argue that the full-sized Xperia Z3 is the better of the two in terms of scale. On the other hand, Xperia Z3 Compact is better for one-handed use. This one is definitely down to preference.</p>
<p>Xperia E3 isn&rsquo;t quite as sharp, but, for a mid-ranger, you certainly can&rsquo;t grumble at its 4.5-inch display with IPS. It offers a superb viewing experience from multiple angles, and colour reproduction is still very rich and vibrant.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption">Image: Sony Xperia Z3</span></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Sony is calling Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact the &lsquo;world&rsquo;s best camera and camcorder in a smartphone&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re not surprised, with a 20.7-megapixel unit with 1/2.3 &lsquo;Exmor RS for mobile&rsquo; image sensor and a new 25mm &lsquo;G Lens&rsquo; and ISO 12800 sensitivity, all working in unison to create true-to-life images.</p>
<p>Users can shoot films in 4K, and, thanks to SteadyShot technology with Intelligent Active Mode, swaying hands and sudden movement won&rsquo;t taint your videos. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be left with smooth and stable results.</p>
<p>There are also some neat software features: Face in &ndash; both the front and rear camera capture a photo at the same time, so you can see your own reaction to an event; AR fun &ndash; add fun animations and doodles to your pictures; and Sound Photo &ndash; the ability to add sounds to your photos, in order to bring them to life.</p>
<p>Xperia E3 shares many of the same software features, but the camera itself isn&rsquo;t quite as capable, at 5-megapixels. But, you can shake the device to launch the camera app, which pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Fitted with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.5GHz quad-core processor with and a 4G LTE modem, both of the latest smartphones in the Z series will produce a seamless and enjoyable user experience, whether you&rsquo;re gaming, surfing the Web or running multiple apps at the same time.</p>
<p>Whilst it may not be quite as powerful with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with quad-core 1.2GHz CPUs, Xperia E3 is still more than capable of performing to your command.</p>
<p>All three smartphones are introducing Sony&rsquo;s STAMINA mode, which has been designed to conserve your battery life for up to <em>two</em> days, by turning off non-essential background functions.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>Boasting High-Resolution Audio, each track you listen to on Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact sounds as good as it was intended to. For tracks that aren&rsquo;t Hi-Res, DSEE HX technology enhances the quality of your tunes to near Hi-Res standard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to drown out up to 98% of ambient sounds with these two devices when you pair with Sony headphones, thanks to Sony Digital Noise Cancelling technology.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem, you can try drowning out everything else using the smartphones&rsquo; front-facing speakers with S-Force Front Surround.</p>
