<p>If you&rsquo;ve read George Orwell's classic dystopian novel, 1984, there were likely many things about it that spooked you. In this dreary and regimented future (which is now the past, but let&rsquo;s not get into that), everyone had to toe the line and no one was entitled to their privacy anymore. To enforce this, there were the Spies, the Thought Police, and even the telescreens that listened in on your every word. Thankfully, all of the above is merely a fictional depiction of the world&hellip; or is it?</p>
<p>For Facebook users, the idea of being spied on by technology may not be so far-fetched. According to Kelli Burns, mass communication professor at the University of South Florida, the Facebook app on people&rsquo;s phones could be being used to listen in on people&rsquo;s everyday conversations. The theory is that Facebook uses things that people say in passing to inform the advertising on their News Feed.</p>
<h2>Facebook Admits It's Listening</h2>
<p>Before you go ahead and call conspiracy theory on this whole story, there&rsquo;s one thing you should know. Facebook makes no secret of its audio listening feature. In fact, on the site&rsquo;s US help pages, the company states that it does use an audio service to figure out what&rsquo;s going on around your phone. For example, if you&rsquo;re watching the Gilmore Girls, the app may listen in so that it can offer you prompts when you write a status about the show. Useful? Maybe. Creepy? Hell, yes.</p>

<p>Contrary to what Professor Burns is claiming, though, the company says that they do <em>not </em>listen to people&rsquo;s private conversations or use this for advertising. &ldquo;Facebook does not use microphone audio to inform advertising or News Feed stories in any way," a Facebook spokesperson recently explained to The Independent. "Businesses are able to serve relevant ads based on people&rsquo;s interests and other demographic information, but not through audio collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To test whether the people at Facebook were telling the truth, Burns decided to conduct a mini experiment. She purposely discussed particular topics while she was near her phone and later found that they appeared on the app as adverts. Of course, this is not enough evidence that Facebook is infringing on people&rsquo;s privacy. There could have been other ways that Facebook knew of the topics Burns talked about. She herself admits she may have searched the same topics online at some point.</p>

<p>But, let&rsquo;s face it, whether Facebook is listening to people to tailor its ads or to improve user experience, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What does matter is that most people are not okay with being recorded by an app. Luckily, users who are potentially being listened to can get around this problem, simply by heading to the app&rsquo;s settings and turning off the microphone function.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most worrying is not the fact that people can&rsquo;t disable this function (because they <em>can</em>), but that it exists in the first place. With our private lives becoming less and less private every day, it&rsquo;s technology like this that we really have to worry about. Facebook officials were honest about the feature since it launched in the US back in 2014. It was made public on Facebook's site, yet, for two years, hardly anyone noticed. Until Burns drew everyone&rsquo;s attention to it. So, the lesson here is clear: Always read the small print.</p>
