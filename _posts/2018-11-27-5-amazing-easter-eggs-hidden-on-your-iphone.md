<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Easter has come early for iPhone users. Here are some of the best kept secrets iOS 12 has to offer.</span></p>
<p>Want to hear a secret? Lean in close and listen to this. There are some delightful Apple iPhone Easter eggs hidden on your device.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve just updated to iOS 12 and feel like going on a little hunt, we&rsquo;ve got just the thing for you. Here are five hacks to try.</p>
<h2>1) Search for Songs Using Their Lyrics</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19578" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4l0VqHKw0-gl5NClDKsvuDeeT1ngby8SLN28kHndGkl_kt2OThh9nVUQiLpp7jZoea7FaXkhjfto7U1IjgJEs3Y=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Has remembering song titles got you in a pickle? We&rsquo;ve all been there. You can hum the tune and sing the first line on demand but can&rsquo;t recall the name of the song.</p>
<p>Luckily, Apple Music has the answer. One of the best iPhone Easter eggs allows you to use the search bar in the app to look for songs using only their lyrics.</p>
<p>For example, if you type the words &ldquo;Is this the real life? Is it just fantasy?&rdquo; Apple Music would bring up &lsquo;Bohemian Rhapsody.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>2) Long-Press Your Keyboard to Move the Cursor</h2>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re typing out an epic text or replying to an email, here&rsquo;s one of the best Apple iPhone Easter eggs you should know about.</p>
<p>If you want to change something in the text and need to move the cursor, simply press and hold anywhere on the keyboard. Doing so will turn your keyboard into a trackpad, allowing you to move the cursor around more easily.</p>
<h2>3) Measure Things Using Your iPhone</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19577" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DkeVthVjPeSo2Kr1lqVKUZN1_q9cVqV4N6Yk2axXa38KgvCjKYVNu60rRkaotvF2HjKAQUJOTNO6rB8ObcypVuOQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>How long is a piece of string? You no longer have to theorise to figure out the answer here. The latest iOS 12 update has you covered.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the most useful iPhone Easter eggs that you will use any time you fancy a bit of DIY. Open the new Measure app on your iPhone to get started. Then, you simply need to point the camera at physical objects and follow the on-screen prompts to get a measurement.</p>
<h2>4) Cut Back on Your Mobile Phone Addiction</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19567" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZpjAI94GgjyAJavo0K31w4u4ysrtXQpuKpO-nwDz3dKtg78qYA__c7kmTOJnrch_UsmGxAgMys2CrpQ-0_KGFUQ=s0" alt="" width="600" height="699" /></p>
<p>Do you spend hours and hours looking at your phone each day? If you&rsquo;re living in the year 2018, as we all are, the answer is likely to be <em>yes</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, there comes a time when we need to take a look up from our screens and interact with the rest of humanity. If only for five minutes. This next iPhone Easter egg has you covered.</p>
<p>Get started by enabling the Screen Time feature on your phone, located in your Settings. Doing so will allow it to measure how long you spend on various apps.</p>
<p>After a day, you can set a limit on your overall screen time, and even specify which apps you want to use less. Also, handy if you have kids, you can set a cut-off time - say, 9pm - to prevent them from watching YouTube videos late into the night.</p>
<h2>5) Setup an Alternate Appearance for Face ID</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19576" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IikNi6HQZh4jV2Us5KJD9DA7skeMQTVwg7nRSTWiPaB22Cs5xRfN5wtE4mgHQtB77UM-OXUptSQSmtF7PEdDa_Wp=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Should you have an iPhone X, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xs</a>, or <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xr-64gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XR</a>, you&rsquo;re going to want to know about this next hack.</p>
<p>Did you know that you could use more than one face (i.e. another person) to unlock your iPhone? For example, if you let your partner or kids use your iPhone from time to time, you might want to change your settings so they can use Face ID, too.</p>
<p>How do you enable this feature? It&rsquo;s easy! Just go to Face ID &amp; Passcode in your Settings and tap Set Up an Alternate Appearance. Then, you just need to scan whoever&rsquo;s face you&rsquo;re registering to allow them to unlock your iPhone. Done!</p>
