<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Google has been accused of snooping on iPhone users, and breaking the law.</span></p>
<p>Google may be forced to pay out &pound;2.7 billion to over five million iPhone users in the UK, after being accused of unlawfully collecting data.</p>
<p>A consumer campaign called Google You Owe Us (GYOU) has launched a legal challenge against Google, claiming that the search engine unlawfully bypassed default security settings on iPhone devices to obtain personal data, between June 2011 and February 2012.</p>
<p>Around 5.4 million people in the UK are reported to have owned an iPhone during this period, according to former executive director of <em>Which?</em> and government advisor Richard Lloyd, who&rsquo;s now leading the legal challenge against Google.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rarely seen such a massive abuse of trust&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the challenge is successful, and Google is obliged to pay out &pound;2.7 billion in compensation, then the 5.4 million iPhone users affected could receive &pound;500 each.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s purported that Google&rsquo;s algorithms allowed it to trick people's iPhones into releasing personal data from the phone's default internet browser, Safari.</p>
<p>Mr Lloyd said: &ldquo;I believe that what Google did was quite simply against the law. Their actions have affected millions, and we&rsquo;ll be asking the courts to remedy this major breach of trust.</p>
<p>"Through this action, we will send a strong message to Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley that we&rsquo;re not afraid to fight back if our laws are broken.</p>

<p>"In all my years speaking up for consumers, I&rsquo;ve rarely seen such a massive abuse of trust where so many people have no way to seek redress on their own.</p>
<p>"That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve taken on one of the biggest fights of my life in representing this legal action, which is the first case of its kind in the UK against a major tech company for misusing our valuable personal data."</p>
