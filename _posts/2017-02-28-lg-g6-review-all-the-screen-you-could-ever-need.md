<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">A new sleeker design that&rsquo;s pretty much all screen.</span></p>
<p>Up until now, there have been loads of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/lg-g6-rumours-and-release-date">rumours surrounding the LG G6</a>, but, luckily for us, we no longer have to speculate. As part of the many MWC 2017 announcements, LG gave people a sneak peak of its brand new flagship phone. If you&rsquo;ve been wondering how the device will look and work (who hasn&rsquo;t?), our LG G6 review is the right place.</p>
<h2>Design: A Whole New Look</h2>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the LG G6 has a simplified design when compared to earlier models. One of the major things that users will notice right away is the fact the entire front panel is now almost exclusively occupied by the screen, which we&rsquo;ll go into in more detail later.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find that the removable back and battery has been scrapped, in favour of a more robust design that&rsquo;s completely dust-tight and waterproof.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13383" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4FRISIh7pIx_mSFtf9dHonPprQ8m_3qcEfmRejDhpZ-75bB-BSOlt3GFoHhisVxZ3bk1RyY1t8ARMCs03zE3NG4D=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Flipping the device over, there&rsquo;s a couple of intriguing feature on the LG G6. For one thing, the camera bump is lacking emphasis; the manufacturers say that they chose to forgo major camera upgrades to create a sleek overall design.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13384" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oiBi4hCYdUEFydqyUknOpZ2QExTrHTdAU8RANly7IcE9wpsm9iczvgHJykn_abj2M_xPZxSbvXC-gBwpOmV86X88Ag=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The snazzy device also includes curved edges and a round fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, which is also the power button. Above that, you will also find two less prominent sensors as well. That&rsquo;s enough to give the LG G6 a rather distinctive look; unlike anything we&rsquo;ve seen in the smartphone world before.</p>
<h2>Display: You'll Have to See it to Believe it</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where LG has really excelled. The fact that it has unleashed the &lsquo;Full Vision&rsquo; screen on the world suggests that this has been LG&rsquo;s main point of focus when creating the G6. What&rsquo;s more, at 5.7-inches, the QHD unit is now larger, packing an impressive 2880 x 1440 pixels. It also boasts an LCD screen, rather than the likes of OLED, which is popular on many modern devices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13385" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yHAN_RejLTtTdt_x_M4nYnREnsfK8swS1-7uHVtxcvSuUPn0OEi80vRCG4rmk23dfk1aqcQ4_1D3YlJb-AyzxMn2=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The picture quality looks like it&rsquo;s a class of its own from early impressions, thanks to Dolby Vision, HDR10 and a QuadHD+ FullVision display. You don&rsquo;t need to know what all that means. You just need to enjoy the pure class of LG G6&rsquo;s cinematic experience.</p>

<p>Possibly the only drawback, is this display won&rsquo;t support Google&rsquo;s Daydream system. In other words, it&rsquo;s not compatible with Google&rsquo;s latest VR headset. Of course, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that there are other cardboard headsets on the market as well.</p>
<h2>Camera: Square Up and Share</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it: the LG manufacturers have upgraded the camera. Featured on the G6, you&rsquo;ll find a dual 13-megapixel lens, one with a standard angle, the other with wider angle for squeezing more into shot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13387" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i5EV8efh_tlOQg57uhDAVu5KAYOJipKmDBOz3jA7c2ddZ8QSMPpm7eHAz5trmpf1mloq6hb4KfXVLROWScUNIa_Ukg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the new square camera modes that give you the functionality review the last shot whilst previewing the next, create 2x2 grid shots, recreate old photos using a guide image, and combine two different photos to express a little creativity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an optical image stabilisation feature which should serve to prevent any changes in image quality. Early reviews of the camera seem to be unanimous in stating that the picture quality is clear and crisp, which is enough for most amateur photographers.</p>
<h2>Performance: Worry-Free Battery Life</h2>
<p>While many of us expected to see the latest Snapdragon 835, from Qualcomm, featured on the phone, that is not the case at all. It would seem that the officials at LG have chosen to stick with the better known Snapdragon 821 chipset.</p>
<p>LG officials state that the reason behind this is because they would rather use a chip which they have expertise in, than one that is somewhat new and yet to be fully tested. Regardless, prepare yourself for an excellent gaming, app and video experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13389" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dk4b-yLcJnvHIxOJrSzpiWLsvD3wwTONB7S76RGShrQuGtcOXZVvLyAct58ycb0cHht9dosbOcT78Yk1d1EkHh4i=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, though, there have most certainly been some improvements. The G5 boasted a mere 2800mAh battery, while the LG G6 has increased this to a massive 3300mAh pack. In the past, LG has been hailed as one of the leading companies when it comes to battery life so including this feature is sure to turn some heads along the way.</p>
<h2>Bonus Feature: Double Trouble</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting features that the LG G6 has to offer is the &lsquo;double screen&rsquo; view. Basically, this feature allows you to see extra information within specific apps. So, for example, if you&rsquo;re using Facebook, you can also have a large percentage of your newsfeed without having to scroll down.</p>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, you can also run two apps simultaneously in the same screen. This is likely one of the biggest changes we&rsquo;ve seen in smartphone interfaces in recent years and whether it will work as well as it should is still very much in question.</p>
<h2>Price Tag and Availability</h2>
<p>Sadly, the LG officials are still keeping schtum about the price. We&rsquo;ve already speculated that the release price will fall somewhere in the region of &pound;400 to &pound;490, based on the LG G5 original cost.</p>
<p>As for when you can get your grubby little mitts on an LG G6, you don&rsquo;t have long to wait at all. It&rsquo;s looking like this awesome new flagship will be available mid to late April.</p>
