<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">New and hidden iOS 11 features you need to know.</span></p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve finally got around to updating your iPhone with the latest and greatest version of iOS, and now you want to know what the big deal is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already told you about the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headline features</a>, but what you don&rsquo;t know yet are these 11 tips and tricks. Get ready to master iOS 11.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you haven't downloaded iOS 11 yet, to do so go to <strong>Settings > General > Software Update</strong>. If your iPhone is compatible with iOS 11, you'll get the option to download it.</em></p>
<h2>1) Easier and Better FaceTime Screenshots</h2>
<p>Those annoyingly blurry screenshots are very much a thing of the past. If you want to catch a quick snap of you and your bestie FaceTiming, iOS 11 gives you the very clearest shot. Just use the little round button in the bottom-left-hand corner of your screen to capture your funniest and silliest moments in an instant. (Oh, but make sure your friend has iOS 11 too!)</p>
<h2>2) Move Multiple Apps at Once</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUc3SD7adDI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the kind of person that needs to get their home screen looking <em>just </em>right, you will adore this next feature. While you&rsquo;re in the process of moving a particular app (you know the drill &mdash; long-hold and then drag!), click another app and it will be included in the group you&rsquo;re moving. That means that you can easily move more than one app at a time.</p>
<h2>3) Screen Record in Real Time</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15121" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RKeZ14q8pY2zFqydgIWBv2eJcM2rUud9GLc0GYPIiXLsGBzJRzC-yTZHNHuflPWoQfVLiPiVgoE9tyGGwuY_Ylj7qA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, you want to show a pal how to do something on an iPhone? We get that. The easiest way to record what you do on the screen, is to <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/how-to-customise-the-control-center-on-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add the feature to your Control Centre</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you just need to click on the little icon and start doing what you&rsquo;ve gotta do. When you want to stop recording, click the icon again. Easy. The video will automatically be saved to your photos.</p>
<h2>4) Turn Off App Ratings. Finally.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15122" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6qUmtRVOBuls8_r4siuPXPPKJ3xmr4CUymLzvNOB8N_U2V3tUr7fsM3Ceinc2LNVxP78GcyHzw3w4eq3-gzSbtR9=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more irritating than being right in the middle of something and seeing that annoying little pop-up saying &ldquo;rate this app&rdquo;. Luckily, with the new iOS 11 update, you can turn this off. Woohoo! Head to <strong>Settings > iTunes &amp; App Store</strong> then toggle-off <strong>In-App Ratings &amp; Reviews</strong>. Annnnnnd relax!</p>
<h2>5) Shut Siri Up for Once</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15123" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ysE0VVkOd0Mqk6k3DHNMeXiXHm88QtA2wDhK_oE1FQY6oCBISn1xftOaH2BS2TMlx9EIw3PHURi7S_KiOQs69DU=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, asking Siri questions aloud is anything but convenient. For example, if you&rsquo;re in a quiet library, the last thing you want to do is interrupt everyone by saying &ldquo;Hey, Siri!&rdquo; If you fancy typing to the smart little bot instead, head to <strong>Settings > General > Accessibility > Siri > Type to Siri</strong>. Sadly, when you do this, Siri will no longer speak aloud back to you. It&rsquo;s a two-way street.</p>
<h2>6) Get More Storage</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15124" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/COZNoqaK3lLA5b4txU38NObQMI2NmYlVvjov_52aKnebfttb5uTKkrMP8bhzaM7bkZ6Ixc2NYQEHmliF2wMILfUn=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you want to make the most of your phone, increasing your storage is certain to be a top priority. Before now, you could only see which apps were draining your space. Now, though, with iOS 11, you get helpful tips on what to do about it. Head to <strong>Settings > General > iPhone Storage</strong> and you will get a whole load of recommendations and help too.</p>
<h2>7) Cool New iMessage Effects</h2>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9Igq1vK23J5VImhW" width="270" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Why send a message when you can send a message with a cool effect? Apple has added more animations to its iMessage app on iOS 11. So, the next time you type a text, rather than merely sending it, try out the Echo effect, or Spotlight.</p>
<h2>8) Get Help in an Emergency</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15125" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K7S06Ij1h9xBnPQCrR-gKnCtfMpaaX3fsWeOuXwbTDdq0pF83DP5i31WfxMdfoQ93yBHCHhU-J0mOJbGFxvpoddU=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>In an emergency situation, time is everything. This latest feature means you can alert the police in seconds. Clicking the power button on the side of your iPhone five times in a row will activate it. (Note: Before you can use this feature, you need to enable it by turning on &lsquo;Auto Call&rsquo; in the Settings of the device!</p>
<h2>9) Easy Access QR Code Scanner</h2>
<p>You no longer need an extra app to scan QR codes on your screen! Instead, you can just use your camera to do it in an instant. Simply point the lens at the code and get snapping away. Phew! That&rsquo;s one less app to worry about.</p>
<h2>10) Access Notes from Lock Screen</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15126" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6pn9KgmbMUgV1P_DAfruIfd_ULkLdmCMWP25bZPUhINtTXPAHN_uIQvmkiYiCwHfMaUxbOU-Bm9zGMcJFoqxOvGw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Notes is arguably one of the best apps on iOS 11. Having a handy little pad whenever and wherever you need it is nothing short of a lifesaver. If you want to be able to access this app from the lock screen, you just need to go to <strong>Control Centre > Customise Control Centre</strong> and then add Notes to the list. Easy!</p>
<h2>11) Scan Documents into Notes</h2>
<p>As if that weren't enough, your camera has another little trick up its sleeve. You can scan your documents using your camera and pop them straight into your notes app. So, if you get a paper letter (what even is one of those?!), you can quickly and easily make a record of it in digital format. Everything in one place.</p>
