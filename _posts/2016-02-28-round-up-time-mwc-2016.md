<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">And so, folks, there we have it. We&rsquo;re at the end of what is arguably the most exciting week in the mobile calendar, and as MWC 2016 winds down, it&rsquo;s time to sit down, take stock, and go through the coolest stuff that got showed off in Barcelona.</span></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s slightly surprising is that many of the big names chose <em>not</em> to bring their new flagships to MWC; both HTC and <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony</a> chose to show off mid-range devices rather than flagship phones, which, while nice, don&rsquo;t grab headlines as much as their more powerful compatriots.</p>
<p>Of course, if we&rsquo;re talking about grabbing headlines, then we have to begin with...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" rel="attachment wp-att-8724"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8724 size-medium" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Cbwff1pWAAA3L03.jpg-large-300x200.jpeg" alt="New Features - Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong><u>Samsung Galaxy S7</u></strong></p>
<p>We suspect that literally no-one is surprised to see the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> grabbing headlines. It is, after all, the next incarnation of the most popular Android phone on the market, and while the design hasn&rsquo;t changed much (although it has been made waterproof, unlike the Galaxy S6), the specs have been bumped up, which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>With a 5.1-inch Quad-HD screen, a Snapdragon 820 processor, a whopping 4Gb of RAM, and a 12MP camera that uses &ldquo;dual-pixel&rdquo; technology for vastly improved low-light performance, the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy</a> is a true powerhouse (as is the Galaxy S7 Edge, which has basically the same specs, albeit with a <em>curved</em> 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen).</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8734 size-medium" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/gsmarena_001-mjbicy5eudpcidoo766cixqgt5a80vw5kh1b7fg1ja-300x180.jpg" alt="News LG G5 Buymobiles" width="300" height="180" /></p>
<p><strong><u>LG G5</u></strong></p>
<p>Moving on to the <em>other</em> big Korean manufacturer, the LG G5 staked out an early claim for star of the show. It&rsquo;s got killer specs (the same processor and RAM as the Galaxy S7, plus a 5.3-inch Quad-HD screen and two cameras on the back, 8MP for wide-angle shots and 16MP for close-ups), and a gorgeous metal body, but what really sets it apart is the modular bottom of the phone.</p>
<p>Yes, you can pull the bottom of the phone, and replace it with a range of different modules; one adds in hardware controls for the camera, for example, while another adds Bang &amp; Olufsen hifi tech. With a promise of more modules to come (and the ability for third parties to make their own), this beauty could have serious (and fantastic) ramifications for the future of mobile phones!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8807" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Desire-825-300x225.jpeg" alt="Desire 825" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p><strong><u>HTC Desire mid-rangers</u></strong></p>
<p>HTC, as said above, chose not to show off any new flagships. Instead, we got three new mid-rangers: the Desire 530, Desire 630 and Desire 825. The specs on all three are most definitely mid-range, but they do come with a new finish that HTC is showing off for the first time. It&rsquo;s called Micro Splash, and it basically adds random dots of colour into the body of the phones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple little touch, but we can&rsquo;t deny that it looks rather good!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8806" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/xperia-x-300x186.jpg" alt="xperia-x" width="300" height="186" /></p>
<p><strong><u>Sony Xperia X</u></strong></p>
<p>Sony&rsquo;s showing was tinged with a little bit of sadness, because while they chose to show off the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony</a> Xperia X (with a Snapdragon 650 processor) and the Sony Xperia XA (which has a <em>really</em> nice edge-to-edge screen), the news then emerged that Sony might be retiring the Z series of phones.</p>
<p>We have some good memories of the Xperia Z series, but we can&rsquo;t deny that Xperia X really <em>is</em> a much cooler name. Plus, of course, there&rsquo;s the Xperia Z Performance, which was not shown off at MWC but which (by all accounts) could easily take the flagship spot in the line-up.</p>
<p>Time will tell, though...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8805" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/cat-s60-thermal.0.0-300x200.png" alt="cat-s60" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong><u>CAT S60</u></strong></p>
<p>Finally, we come to a phone that you might not be expecting, because it&rsquo;s branded by Caterpillar. As in the Caterpillar that makes heavy industrial machinery. However, it&rsquo;s actually made by a company called Bullitt (who make ultra-tough phones and share a name with a Steve McQueen film, so you <em>know</em> they&rsquo;re cool), with help from camera manufacturer FLIR, and that last name should give you a hint as to why this phone is so special, <em>if</em> you know what it means.</p>
<p>Yes, it means Forward-Looking Infra-Red, and the cameras they make aren&rsquo;t <em>normal</em> cameras. No, they make proper infra-red thermal imaging cameras, and thus, the CAT S60 is the first smartphone ever to have a <em>heat vision</em> camera.</p>
<p>Yep, just like the Predator.</p>
<p>Now of course, it&rsquo;s aimed more at commercial users in the construction industry, but we could imagine a few consumers falling in love with it (not least because, in spite of being tough as nails, it&rsquo;s got a surprisingly fast processor, 3GB of RAM <em>and</em> a normal 13MP camera).</p>
<p>Whether it does or not, however, we can&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to celebrate the launch of the first phone that lets you properly see the world in the same way as the crab-faced alien that took Arnie to the cleaners...</p>
<p><strong>And that, folks, was MWC 2016; a slightly mixed bag, but the superstar phones that did show their faces... well, they were <em>properly</em> nice. Now we wait and see how well they perform in the market. Stay tuned for more news... </strong></p>
