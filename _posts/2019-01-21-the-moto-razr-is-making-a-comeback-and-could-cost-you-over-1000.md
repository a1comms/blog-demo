<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s an expensive flashback to the early 2000s!</span></p>
<p>The early noughties may seem like a lifetime ago, but, for a quick moment, cast your mind back to the way things used to be.</p>
<p>Long before the shiny new era of smartphones, the humble mobile phone was a whole different ball game. Flip-phones were king and the thinner they were, the more we wanted them in our back pockets.</p>
<p>One of the most iconic phones of the time was, of course, the Moto RAZR. The device was super thin and amazingly slick. It was the must-have of the day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got pangs of nostalgia for the device, there&rsquo;s something that you need to know. The good news is that the phone is making a comeback soon enough. The bad news is that it&rsquo;s set to be a luxury device that will cost $1,500 (around &pound;1,164).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9f9FMxa6cY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to splash that cash, you might have to hop across the pond to get it. The latest news is that the phone will be an exclusive device to the Verizon network in America. The new Moto RAZR will likely launch (or relaunch, if you will!) at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) this year. The event takes place in February, so we&rsquo;ll have to wait a while for the unveiling.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s very little information coming our way. We don&rsquo;t yet have any details about how the phone will look. The device could be a full-on retro throwback, maintaining a lot of the original features as the first-generation Moto RAZR. That would be a similar setup to the Nokia 3310, which made a comeback a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the phone could be an up-to-date smartphone that simply has the RAZR branding on it. With a grand price tag, it would make sense for the phone to be a little more technologically advanced. In that case, we could see a whole new device, complete with a touchscreen and the latest features.</p>
<p>The Lenovo company, Moto&rsquo;s parent company, is said to be manufacturing 200,000 new RAZR models. But it&rsquo;s not the first time that the phone has been brought back to life&hellip;</p>
<p>Between 2011-12, there was the Droid RAZR line. These were, sadly, not flip-phones. However, we can hold out hope for the brand-new collection. Perhaps, the time is right for us to get the RAZR reboot that we all deserve.</p>
