<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">An Android masterclass, perfect for mobile gaming and everyday use.</span></p>
<p>Razer is best known in the gaming community as the go-to brand for computing merchandise and accessories, manufacturing and shipping worldwide from bases in Singapore and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Razer designs and develops its own gaming products, from laptops to tablets, and PC accessories, like headsets, mice and keyboards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also well known in the industry as a pioneer of esports. Team Razer supports its pro-gamer teams in gaming competitions, supplying them with market leading gear to compete at the highest levels.</p>
<p>Razer lives by the motto: For Gamers. By Gamers. Find out how this has been carried through in its first ever smartphone, Razer Phone.</p>

<h2>Specs and Features</h2>
<p>Built with gaming in mind, you won&rsquo;t find a better smartphone capable of playing your favourite games in such high quality and detail.</p>
<p>A super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor means a fluid phone performance that has zero lag, backed-up by 8GB RAM to boot.</p>
<p>The two together give a superior performance when watching video, with a Quad HD display capable of steaming your favourite shows on Netflix in HDR.</p>
<p>You get a large battery too, with Razer Phone boasting a 4000mAh monster, which is more than enough to keep you gaming and streaming for hours.</p>
<p>It comes with ample storage too, 64GB of space to be exact, meaning you&rsquo;ll have plenty of room to keep your favourite apps and games. Furthermore, Android 7.1.1 Nougat gives you access to Google Play and added security that comes with newer Android versions.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be left wanting more, thanks to the powerful Dolby Atmos dual front-facing speakers on the Razer Phone. Dual amplifiers mean they&rsquo;re damn loud too!</p>
<p>Less a headphone jack to make space for a bigger battery, the Razer Phone comes with an adapter should you wish to listen through headphones when on-the-go.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the Razer Phone speakers will outmatch any cheap Bluetooth speakers, and give many others a run for their money.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The Razer Phone design is impressive, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. A fingerprint reader has been positioned on the side of the device, for added ease and quick phone unlocking.</p>
<p>A beautiful 5.7-inch display means the Razer Phone is pretty much all-screen, with its speakers top and tailing the device.</p>
<p>Its sharp look, sleek edges and no-nonsense appearance, means it does what it says on the tin, without pretending to be something it&rsquo;s not. However, as we already know, Razer&rsquo;s saved its panache for the performance department.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, its still a smart looking phone that will definitely stand out from the crowd.</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>Get a phone with cameras that are up to the job. Razer Phone boasts dual main cameras, a 12-megapixel wide-angle sensor with f/1.75 aperture, and 12-megapizel zoom sensor with f/2.6 aperture. This means your Razer Phone can capture sweet photos in everyday scenarios, as well as perform in low light.</p>
<p>An 8-megapixel secondary camera comes with a fixed focus sensor and f/2.0 aperture, meaning you&rsquo;ll be able to snap crisp and clear selfies until your heart's content.</p>
<p>Since Razer Phone&rsquo;s launch in 2017, a camera software update has been added to improve the phones camera experience. The native camera app now has improved zoom, shutter speeds and image optimisations for even more photo power.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>The price of the Razer Phone is pretty competitive compared with other mobile flagships, and currently comes with an amazing data deal, that includes no less than 100GB! This can all be yours for &pound;30 per month on the Three network.</p>
<p>Use your data allowance for tethering to other devices too. Just so you know, there's a 30GB cap on Three.</p>
