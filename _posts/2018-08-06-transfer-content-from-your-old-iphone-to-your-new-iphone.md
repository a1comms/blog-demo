<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s really easy to transfer your photos, contacts, apps and everything else to your new iPhone. Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Receiving a new iPhone is one of life&rsquo;s sweetest pleasures. That feeling you get as you start to unbox it, it&rsquo;s like a dozen Christmas mornings rolled into one moment. And when you pick it up for the first time, everything about your new iPhone is so perfect, you don&rsquo;t even want to peel off the protective film. We&rsquo;ve all been there&hellip;</p>
<p>Then, a sudden thought hits you. How exactly do I transfer all my content from my old iPhone, to my new one? It&rsquo;s a question that haunts all of us the day we receive our new iPhone, so don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re alone. And please don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be a problem, we&rsquo;ll instruct you how to do it, in just a few easy steps.</p>
<h2>First Thing&rsquo;s First</h2>
<p>Before you start, if you own an Apple Watch, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/set-up-your-apple-watch/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpair it from your old iPhone</a>. When you unpair your Apple Watch, it gets automatically backed up, allowing you to restore your data once you pair with your new iPhone.</p>
<h2>Option 1) &ndash; iCloud</h2>
<p>This option will explain how to back up your old iPhone&rsquo;s content to iCloud, which you can then transfer to your new iPhone. Alternatively, you can back up your iPhone via iTunes, as detailed below under Option Two &ndash; iTunes. If you&rsquo;ve got slow Wi-Fi, Option Two might be better, but the choice is yours!</p>
<h5>Back Up to iCloud</h5>
<p>1. Connect your old iPhone to the Internet via Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>2. Go to Settings > iCloud > Backup.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11613" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/icloud-backup.jpg" alt="icloud-backup" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>3. Turn on iCloud backup if it isn&rsquo;t already, then tap Back Up Now.</p>
<p>4. Make sure your old iPhone stays connected to the Internet until the backup is complete.</p>
<h5>Transfer Your SIM Card</h5>
<p>&bull; If you ordered a new contract deal on EE, Three or Vodafone, insert your new SIM card into your new iPhone.</p>
<p>&bull; If you ordered an EE upgrade, and your old SIM card fits your new iPhone, insert it. If your old SIM card doesn&rsquo;t fit your new iPhone, don&rsquo;t worry, we will have sent you a new SIM card that will. Insert your new SIM card into your new iPhone, and contact EE to complete a SIM swap.</p>
<p>&bull; If you&rsquo;re moving from T-Mobile or Orange to EE, insert your new SIM card into your new iPhone.</p>
<h5>Transfer Your iCloud Backup to Your New iPhone</h5>
<p>1. Turn your new device on and follow the steps until you reach the Wi-Fi screen. If you&rsquo;ve already set up your new iPhone, you&rsquo;ll need to reset it. See the bottom of the page for instructions on how to reset your iPhone.</p>
<p>2. Join an available Wi-Fi network and follow the steps until you reach the Apps &amp; Data screen. Then, tap Restore from iCloud Backup > Next.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11614" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/backup.jpg" alt="backup" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>3. Sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID and password, then when asked to choose a backup, select the most recent one. If you&rsquo;re asked to update to a newer version of iOS, <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/how-to-transfer-content-from-your-old-iphone-to-your-new-iphone/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow these steps</a>.</p>
<p>4. Ensure your iPhone remains connected to Wi-Fi, allowing the iCloud restore to complete. Once done, follow the remaining on-screen steps to finish setting up your new iPhone. You&rsquo;ll notice your apps, photos and music begin downloading once you reach the Home screen.</p>

<h2>Option 2) &ndash; iTunes</h2>
<p>This option will explain how to back up your old iPhone&rsquo;s content to iTunes, which you can then transfer to your new iPhone.

<h5>Back Up to iTunes</h5>
<p>1. Connect your old iPhone to your computer using your Lightning to USB cable.</p>
<p>2. Open iTunes on your computer and select your device.</p>
<p>3. To save your Health and Activity data from your iPhone or Apple Watch, you&rsquo;ll need to encrypt your backup. Select Encrypt [device] backup and make note of your password. If you don&rsquo;t wish to save any Health and Activity data, simply click Back Up Now.</p>

<p>4. Once the backup finishes, check it has done so successfully by going to iTunes Preferences > Devices. If all is good, you&rsquo;ll see the name of your iPhone, as well as the date and time the backup was created. A small padlock <img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/lock_inline_icon.png" alt=" " data-hires="true" />&nbsp;will show if you encrypted your backup.</p>

<h2><strong>Restoring an iTunes or iCloud backup if asked for a new version of iOS</strong></h2>
<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If you&rsquo;ve tried to restore an iCloud or iTunes backup on a new iPhone, but can&rsquo;t because you need to update it, here&rsquo;s what you need to do&hellip;</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the software on your old iPhone is more up-to-date than the software on your new iPhone. In such a scenario, you need to update your new iPhone before transferring data to it.</p>
<p>1. Turn your new device on and follow the steps until you reach the Wi-Fi screen.</p>
<p>2. Join an available Wi-Fi network and follow the steps until you reach the Apps &amp; Data screen. Then, tap Set Up as New iPhone > Next.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11614" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/backup.jpg" alt="backup" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>3. Work through the steps, skipping any requests for Apple ID credentials, Touch ID or a passcode.</p>
<p>4. Once you finish the setup process, and you reach the Home screen, go to Settings > General > Software Update, and update to latest version of iOS.</p>
<p>5. Once the update finishes and the iPhone restarts, erase it. Do this by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Once the reset completes, your device will restart and launch the setup process.</p>
<p>6. Finally, complete the restore from backup process as detailed on the <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/how-to-transfer-content-from-your-old-iphone-to-your-new-iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous page</a>.</p>
