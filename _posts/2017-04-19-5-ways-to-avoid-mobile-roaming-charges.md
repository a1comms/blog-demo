<h3>Because no one wants a post-holiday shock!</h3>
<p>Holiday season is just around the corner, which means just one thing &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to plan your next great escape. Still, when it&rsquo;s all over and you&rsquo;ve travelled the globe, the last thing you want to come home to is a nasty shock. The post-holiday blues are one thing but coming back to a hefty roaming charges bill is a back-to-reality check that none of us want.</p>
<p>So, what can you do? Well, if you want to use your phone abroad, there are a few ways that you can avoid extra charges. It&rsquo;s all about being sensible and understanding what you will and won&rsquo;t get charged for before you head off into the sunset. Here are just five little ideas that may help you avoid those fees and still have a whole load of fun in the sun.</p>
<h3>1. Use WiFi instead of data</h3>
<p>One option that you may want to consider is using WiFi rather than any of your phone data. You should turn your data roaming off when you&rsquo;re abroad if you&rsquo;re going to try this for yourself. That way, the only way your smartphone can get online is if it taps into a local hotspot. Whenever you go somewhere - be it your hotel or a restaurant - you can check for a hotspot nearby. Often enough, you just need to ask the staff for the passcode to use it.</p>
<p>Failing that, you may also want to download an app such as WiFi Finder for your smartphone ahead of time. That way, you can seek out hotspots in your local area in no time at all. So, whenever you need to find some free internet, it will take just minutes to do so. Genius.</p>
<h3>2. Check out your network travel deals</h3>
<p>Now, this next tip really does depend on what network you happen to be on. Many of the major mobile networks out there actually have deals for travel roaming data. If you let your provider know ahead of time, you could find that you end up paying less for a whole load of data and even calls and texts to boot. It&rsquo;s worth checking out what your phone network offers in this area and letting them know that you&rsquo;re going away too.</p>
<p>Some of the leading networks have excellent deals when it comes to roaming data. For example, <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/Support/Roaming_and_international/Roaming_abroad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three</a> offer the ability to use your data abroad in 42 destinations at no extra cost. On the other hand, <a href="http://ee.co.uk/help/add-ons-benefits-and-plans/call-or-going-abroad/roaming-customers-after-17th-august-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EE</a> offer a &lsquo;Euro Pass&rsquo; plan which means that you can use data, calls, and texts in Europe for just &pound;4 a day.</p>
<h3>3. Restrict your background data</h3>
<p>Modern day smartphones are funny old things. Even when you&rsquo;re not consciously using your phone to go online, you likely have apps that are synced up to the internet. If you want to avoid incurring loads of extra charges, you need to put an end to that as soon as possible. Luckily, doing so is actually very simple.</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone, you will need to go to <b>Settings > Mobile Data > Data Roaming</b> and then toggle the little switch off. That way, none of your background apps (email, maps, social media etc) will access the net without you using them. On an Android device, you can achieve the same effect by heading to <b>Settings > Data</b> and then selecting &ldquo;Restrict background data&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>4. Use an app to compress your data</h3>
<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t be expected to <i>stop </i>using our data altogether when we&rsquo;re on holiday, right? If you love nothing more than snooping on Facebook while you&rsquo;re away, there&rsquo;s an extra app you should get.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.onavo.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onavo app</a> helps you to &lsquo;compress&rsquo; the mobile data you use so that you can supposedly do five times as much online without getting extra charges. It basically means that you view stripped down (or leaner) versions of websites with less nonsense so that you can save on data when you&rsquo;re abroad. Oh, and yes, it&rsquo;s available for iPhones and Androids. Hurrah.</p>
<h3>5. Keep checking your usage!</h3>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s just one thing that any sensible person should do when they are abroad. No, not wear sunscreen (although, you should also do that). You need to keep on top of your usage status. That means checking how much data you have used on a daily basis so that you don&rsquo;t go over your limit. You know it makes sense.</p>
<p>Doing so is strikingly simple. If you&rsquo;re on EE, you just need to login to the My EE app or text &ldquo;AL&rdquo; to 150 to find out how much you&rsquo;ve used and how much you have left. On the other hand, Three customers can go to Planet 3 and check their My3 account. Nothing could be easier.</p>
