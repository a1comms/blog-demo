<p><span class="postStandFirst">It seems to be human nature to codify things into lists, no matter what those things are. It also seems to be human nature to structure those lists into league tables, whether the subject at hand is football teams, schools&rsquo; exam results or, as is of interest to us here, mobile phone sales.</span></p>
<p>Since the early days of the mobile industry, there has been an informal list of the biggest manufacturers in the world, by sales, and that list is known as the Big Five.</p>
<p>In the years following the turn of the millennium, the Big Five stayed relatively constant, with Nokia being in the top spot, Sony Ericsson (now just Sony) in second place, and the remaining spots taken up by Motorola, Samsung and LG.</p>
<p><em>Now</em>, though, the mobile industry has changed, and so has the Big Five list; which manufacturers make up this&nbsp;<em>New</em>&nbsp;Big Five?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out (using the last list of Big Five manufacturers, from October 2012)!</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>HTC join this top five countdown as one of the three Android manufacturers on the list. Their latest phone, the&nbsp;HTC One, has seen more pre-orders (in the American market, at least) than any phone in HTC&rsquo;s history, so it seems eminently possible that the Taiwanese manufacturer will be moving up the charts the next time the Big Five list is redrawn.</p>
<h2>ZTE</h2>
<p>Next on the list is a Chinese manufacturer who&rsquo;s come from relative obscurity to worldwide superstardom; ZTE. Their success has been largely down to a winning combination of cool features and incredibly affordable prices, so much so that there&rsquo;s every possibility ZTE will come to completely dominate the mid-range in future (although they don&rsquo;t yet; the mid-range is currently dominated by another manufacturer on this list).</p>
<h2>BlackBerry</h2>
<p>In the number three spot is the manufacturer formerly known as RIM, now reborn as Blackberry, after the phones for which they are known. Blackberry&rsquo;s presence on this list is impressive, given that the&nbsp;Blackberry Z10&nbsp;is the first phone the manufacturer has released in quite a while. However, the Blackberry Z10 is also a&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>&nbsp;phone, so it could well be enough to make sure that Blackberry&nbsp;<em>stays</em>&nbsp;on the Big Five list.</p>
<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise at all to see Apple on this list, because the iPhone range has gone from being merely a series of mobile phones to being a legitimate, worldwide phenomenon. The&nbsp;iPhone 5&nbsp;gives the range a more modern 4 inch screen, and based on previous performance, it seems likely that Apple will stay on the Big Five list for a long time to come.</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost hard to comprehend how&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;Samsung is, and not just in terms of mobile phones; the Korean giant is a major player in pretty much the whole consumer electronics arena. In terms of phones, Samsung has had some truly stellar successes, with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s3-white">Samsung Galaxy S3</a>&nbsp;being the first individual phone to outsell the iPhone, and the highly anticipated&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4&nbsp;all set to beat even its predecessor&rsquo;s record. Samsung also singlehandedly introduced an entire new market segment, the phablet, with their Galaxy Note series.</p>
<p><strong>And so, that is the current Big Five. With manufacturers constantly trying to outdo one another, to hit that all important top spot, one thing is for sure: it&rsquo;s customers like you and me who benefit the most!&nbsp;</strong></p>
