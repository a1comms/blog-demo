<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Hold onto your little piggies &ndash; this is happening!</span></p>
<p>If flinging colourful little birds at unsuspecting piggies is your jam, we&rsquo;ve got some rather exciting news for you.</p>
<p>The Angry Birds franchise is levelling-up and will soon be available as a brand-new AR-powered game. It&rsquo;s certainly an exciting time to be alive.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the series, Angry Birds: Isle of Pigs, will use the forces of augmented reality to give users a completely new style of play. The game was actually announced last year under a slightly different name. While the name may have changed, the fundamentals remain the same &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about bringing the slingshotting action into reality.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick trailer that will whet your appetite ahead of its launch:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re at all familiar with the classic Angry Birds games &ndash; and you should be! &ndash; this new one will be pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to knock pigs off fortresses by using a slingshot and a variety of, you guessed it, angry birds. Needless to say, as you move from level to level, the strongholds get trickier.</p>
<p>That means that you have to unleash your most epic tactics to ensure that not one single pig is left standing. Simple stuff.</p>
<h2>How Does Angry Birds: Isle of Pigs Work?</h2>
<p>Before now, these escapades were limited to the realms of a cartoon world. But that&rsquo;s all about to change.</p>
<p>The new game will see the characters and their fortresses superimposed over real life objects and surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, if you point your phone camera at your kitchen table while in play, you will see the table on your screen along with the game. It will basically look as though the fort has been built on top of the table!</p>

<h2>Introducing&hellip; 3D Game Play!</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest advantages to the game working with AR is the fact that it&rsquo;s now 3D.</p>
<p>Yas! That means that you can move around and see the fortress from different angles as you&rsquo;re playing it.</p>
<p>If we use the example of your kitchen table again, you could stand up and walk around the table to get to a better slingshot angle. It adds a whole new dimension to the game &ndash;&nbsp;literally &ndash;&nbsp;and means that it&rsquo;s more immersive than ever before.</p>

<h2>When Can You Get It on iOS?</h2>
<p>If you love the sound of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds-ar-isle-of-pigs/id1456120259?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angry Birds: Isle of Pigs</a>, there&rsquo;s one question that may be burning away at you.</p>
<p>When can you download it for either your iPhone or iOS? The exciting new game isn&rsquo;t officially out until 11th April.</p>
<p>However, pre-order for the app started last week. So, if you&rsquo;re extra eager and want to make sure that you get it the moment it comes out, head to the app store and order it for free now!</p>
