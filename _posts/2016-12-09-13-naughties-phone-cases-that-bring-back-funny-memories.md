<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">These retro cases bring back some embarrassing memories!</span></p>
<p>While tech has come a seriously long way since the early 00s, there&rsquo;s something nostalgic about the devices of that era. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because, for most of us, it was when we first got our grubby little hands on an actual mobile phone!</p>
<p>While some people had Sagems, and some had those bulky old BT phones, there was only one mobile that we really wanted - the Nokia 3310.</p>
<p>Yes, it featured a black and white screen. And yes, it only had one decent game on it (RIP Snake), with no apps in sight. But none of that was an issue. You see, the greatest thing about the indestructible Nokia 3310 and others like it was the flexibility to interchange tacky cases decorated with iconic 00s pop culture. Here are some absolute gems you'll no doubt remember.</p>
<h2>1) Whassup?!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12614" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456846237-wassupp.jpg" alt="gallery-1456846237-wassupp" width="500" height="416" /></p>
<p>Oh, dear me! Over the years, I&rsquo;d somehow managed to block out this annoying catchphrase, but here it is again. What started with a mere advert slogan turned into something way darker and more irritating. If you were one of those silly teens who walked around the playground shouting this at everyone, you likely had the case to match!</p>

<h2>2) Buffy the Vampire Slayer</h2>

<p>Okay, I never got the chance to board the Buffy the Vampire Slayer train (my parents wouldn&rsquo;t let me watch it - boo!), but I knew a load of people who lived for this show. What better way to show their fandom to the world than owning a Buffy-themed phone case?</p>
<p>Besides, there was the small side point that Sarah Michelle Gellar (a.k.a. Buffy) was a mega-babe and all the guys had the hots for her.</p>

<h2>3-6) Brand Names</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12616" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456847841-nokia-brands.jpg" alt="gallery-1456847841-nokia-brands" width="600" height="250" /></p>
<p>Looking back, these brands probably should've paid us for our endorsements. I mean, having them plastered all over our naughtiest Nokia phone cases was basically just free advertising for them.</p>
<p>From Ford to 7-Up, we loved nothing more than using our phones to hype our favourite brands. Can you say <em>mindless</em> <em>sheep</em>? Baaaaa!</p>

<h2>7) Pop Idol</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12617" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456845292-will-young-nokia.jpg" alt="gallery-1456845292-will-young-nokia" width="550" height="376" /></p>
<p>Remember when Will Young and Gareth Gates went head to head on Pop Idol? Remember how all the girls picked teams and fancied the pants off the both of them? Remember how disappointed they all were when they found out Will wasn't, erm, interested? I do! Basically, every 12-16-year-old girl had this case at the time, just to show their allegiance.</p>

<h2>8) Kelly Brook</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12618" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456846045-kelly-brook-nokia2.jpg" alt="gallery-1456846045-kelly-brook-nokia2" width="768" height="511" />The late 90s and early 00s saw the birth of so-called &lsquo;lad culture&rsquo; here in the UK. That really meant two things; guzzling down cheap larger, and ogling less-than-dignified ladies in The Sun. Queen of those ladies was Kelly Brook, model slash presenter slash fashion icon. You weren&rsquo;t an official lad without one of these semi-pornographic cases on your phone.</p>

<h2>9-11) Winnie the Pooh</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12619" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456846820-winnie-nokia.jpg" alt="gallery-1456846820-winnie-nokia" width="600" height="166" /></p>
<p>While we all tried to outgrow Winnie the Pooh and co. years before the launch of the Nokia 3310, it seems we were nostalgic even then. Having a Piglet or Tigger case may have looked a little childish, but the first hipsters probably thought it was &lsquo;retro&rsquo; at the time. <em>I totally had a Piglet case. Don&rsquo;t judge me&hellip;</em></p>

<h2>12-13) Football Clubs</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12620" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gallery-1456849142-football-nokia.jpg" alt="gallery-1456849142-football-nokia" width="600" height="308" /></p>
<p>Finally, we have to include this retro phone case. If you were a diehard footy fan, there was only one case worth adorning your Nokia with. Yep, you could get one back in the 00s for any major football club out there, and official ones did <em>not </em>come cheap. Yikes!</p>
