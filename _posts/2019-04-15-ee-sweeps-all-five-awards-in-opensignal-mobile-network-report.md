<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s a clean sweep for the UK's biggest 4G network!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Award season is upon us in the mobile phone world, which means that it&rsquo;s time to raise our glasses to this year&rsquo;s winners. The results of the Opensignal report are out and there&rsquo;s one clear winner across the board this time around.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Mobile Network Experience Report looks at five different categories -&nbsp;4G Availability, Video Experience, Download Speed Experience, Upload Speed Experience, and Latency Experience.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you might imagine, it&rsquo;s always a close one between the four major networks: <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee">EE</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/o2">O2</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Three (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee" target="_blank">Three</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/vodafone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Vodafone (opens in a new tab)">Vodafone</a>. The latest report came out just this month and EE took the highest prize in <em>every single</em> category. You might call that a clean sweep. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the results:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>4G Availability</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These days, you need 4G to do just about everything when you&rsquo;re out and about. Whether it&rsquo;s calling a quick Uber or checking Maps to see where you are, your network signal is essential. After measuring the experiences from network to network, the Opensignal report found that EE has a whopping 89% availability across the board, making it the winner.</p>

<h2>Video Experience</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was a close call between EE and Vodafone but the former pipped the later to the post, by scoring a massive 68.5% here. Both O2 and Three were also within five points of EE on this one, making it a very close race between the providers.</p>

<h2>Download Speed Experience</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re downloading stuff via your mobile network, what you really need is a super-speedy experience. Nobody has time to wait around for slow downloads to enjoy great content. In this category, EE took the top prize yet again with a score of 29.6%. However, many of the other network providers have increased their scores dramatically too.</p>

<h2>Upload Speed Experience</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered download speed, it&rsquo;s time to talk about upload speed. With a 2 Mbps lead on its rivals this time around, EE once again hit the top spot. The Opensignal report checked out both 4G and 3G upload speeds for this particular section.</p>

<h2>Latency Experience</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Put simply, the latency experience measures the time between tapping something on your phone and it responding. For example, sometimes, you may experience a short lag between your action and your device&rsquo;s reaction. We&rsquo;ve all been there. In this category, EE was the outright winner once again. Nice stuff.</p>
