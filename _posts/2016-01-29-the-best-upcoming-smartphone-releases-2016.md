<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Last year saw the coming of Apple and Huawei&rsquo;s pressure-sensitive screens, essentially bringing a right click to mobiles.</span></p>
<p>We revelled in awe as Sony unveiled the first 4K device in its Xperia Z5 Premium.</p>
<p>And then Motorola set a new precedent by launching a smartphone with &lsquo;the world&rsquo;s first shatterproof&rsquo; display.</p>
<p>2015 was an incredible time to be alive...</p>
<p>Now with a new calendar year unfolding in front of us, it&rsquo;s time to look towards the&nbsp;next generation of the&nbsp;best upcoming smartphone releases 2016.</p>
<h3>Year Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S7 &ndash; February</li>
<li>HTC One M10 &ndash; February</li>
<li>LG G5 &ndash; February</li>
<li>iPhone 6C / 5SE &ndash; March</li>
<li>Sony Xperia Z6 &ndash; September</li>
<li>iPhone 7 &ndash; September</li>
<li>Microsoft Surface Phone &ndash; October</li>
</ul>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S7</h3>
<p>Samsung must be feeling the pressure, since the fabled Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are two of the most anticipated releases of 2016.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more is they have a difficult act to follow after last year&rsquo;s line-up, which stole the headlines as the first in the Galaxy flagship family to sport all-metal designs, after years of plastic devices.</p>
<p>Because we saw such radical design changes, we think it&rsquo;s unlikely that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge will offer much difference in the looks department. But you can bet Samsung has some internal bumps and added features prepared for us.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8214" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-8214 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 edges in black and silver" width="800" height="427" /> It's thought that Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will share similar design traits to their predecessors.[/caption]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been talk of a 4K display to rival the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The current Galaxy S6 models boast Quad HD units, which, you have to admit, feel like they&rsquo;re enough. So we&rsquo;re not sure Samsung will deem a pixel increase as a necessity, especially at the expense of battery performance.</p>
<p>Something that sounds a little more likely is the introduction of a pressure-sensitive screen, similar to iPhone 6s and Huawei Mate S. This&rsquo;ll open up a whole new avenue of interaction with Samsung Galaxy S7, allowing you to launch commands by increasing the force of your touch.</p>
<p>Rumours point towards a 12-megapixel and 5-megapixel camera combination, although some sources are claiming that Samsung has been testing a dual camera, and even a 20-megapixel unit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8218 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-camera.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Camera graphic" width="800" height="454" /></p>
<p>As far as performance goes, the Galaxy S7 will undoubtedly shine, as it looks like it could house a Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB RAM.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;ll feature a fingerprint scanner just like the previous iteration, but may take charging down a new route, with a USB Type-C port. Will the wireless charging trend continue? We think so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably looking at Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge being announced a day or two prior to MWC (22-25 Feb), on 21<sup>st</sup> February at Samsung&rsquo;s own press event.</p>
<p>Read our full Samsung Galaxy S7 rumour roundup here.</p>
<h3>HTC One M10</h3>
<p>One of the more surprising rumours around HTC&rsquo;s next flagship, is the alleged move to axe the &lsquo;M&rsquo; branding, as used for HTC One M8 and One M9 etc. The substituted name (according to the Internet) is &lsquo;HTC Perfume&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Might we see any changes and improvements to design? It&rsquo;s always possible, since HTC has invested so much focus into this area over the years, producing a number of stunning handsets. We&rsquo;d like to see something different.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8298" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8298" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/HTC-One-M9-in-Silver-on-a-black-background.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/HTC-One-M9-in-Silver-on-a-black-background.jpg alt=&rdquo; Will the HTC One M10 take on a new form from the One M9?&rdquo;>" width="800" height="500" /> The stunning HTC One M9 - will the HTC One M10 take on a new form?[/caption]</p>
<p>Will HTC follow the trend towards a Quad HD display? Apparently so, according to the speculation. Previous HTC One generations have donned a 1080p HD display, but mounting pressure from other brands, who&rsquo;ve adopted the extra bump in resolution, could see HTC take the leap.</p>
<p>Like the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S7, HTC&rsquo;s next flagship will likely pack the latest Snapdragon 820 processor and 3-4GB RAM. It should also offer an integrated fingerprint scanner, which is something HTC hasn&rsquo;t yet fully adopted.</p>
<p>The HTC One M10 / Perfume is touted for announcement on or around the same day as the Galaxy S7, so you&rsquo;re looking at 21<sup>st</sup> February.</p>
<h3>iPhone 6C / 5SE</h3>
<p>Certainly one of the tastiest rumours of 2016 is the launch of a smaller, more affordable iPhone, once dubbed iPhone 6C, but now tipped to be called iPhone 5SE (special edition).</p>
<p>As is always the case with Apple, rumours are pretty thin on the ground. The whispers that have escaped Cupertino headquarters paint a picture of a 4-inch, plastic iPhone with curved edges like iPhone 6. And, just like iPhone 5C, it could be available in a range of vibrant colours.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8302" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8302" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/iPhone-5SE-Concept-from-SET-Solutions.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/iPhone-5SE-Concept-from-SET-Solutions.jpg alt=&rdquo;iPhone 6C / 5SE colourful concepts from SET Solutions&rdquo;>" width="800" height="450" /> iPhone 6C / 5SE colourful concepts from SET Solutions[/caption]</p>
<p>Since the iPhone 6C / 5SE would proposition itself as more of a budget option, we can&rsquo;t see it featuring a camera any more powerful than those in iPhone 6. So we&rsquo;ll probably see it equipped with an 8-megapixel main camera and 1.2-megapixel front-camera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be surprised to see a new iPhone without Touch ID or Apple Pay, which has now taken off with fantastic success in the UK. However, one omission might include 3D Touch, the pressure-sensitive screen technology debuted by iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you probably won&rsquo;t see iPhone 6C / 5SE at MWC. Apple has its own press event organised later in March, where it&rsquo;s expected to unveil this elusive device, as well as Apple Watch 2 and potentially some other goodies.</p>
<h3>LG G5</h3>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s LG G4 was huge news. Not only did its camera and price tag blow everyone else out of the water, it came dressed in a sweet leather jacket. All that was missing was a Marlborough Red and a greasy quiff.</p>
<p>If you believe the speculation, though, LG is discarding the retro look for something a little more premium, in the form of an all-metal shell. Whilst this may not look as distinctive as the leather jacket, it will bring the reported LG G5 in line with the design ethos at the high-end of the market.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8304" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8304" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/LG-G5-black-leather.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/LG-G5-black-leather.jpg alt=&rdquo;LG G5 is rumoured to be missing out on the G4&rsquo;s stylish leather jacket&rdquo;>" width="800" height="478" /> LG G5 is rumoured to be missing out on the G4&rsquo;s stylish leather jacket[/caption]</p>
<p>Other features could include a Quad HD display, rather than upgrade to 4K. Of course, to power all of those thirsty pixels, it&rsquo;s going to need fuel in abundance. Supplying it is, allegedly, a monstrous 4000mAh battery, complete with induction charging for topping up wirelessly.</p>
<p>One upgrade we keep hearing about is an iris scanner that unlocks your phone as you look at it. This technology has already been showcased on Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL with success, and would be a welcomed addition to LG&rsquo;s flagship series, that doesn&rsquo;t yet feature anything to quickly access the devices, like a fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking like LG G5 will be announced at MWC, around about the same time as HTC One M10 and Samsung Galaxy S7.</p>
<h3>Sony Xperia Z6</h3>
<p>Over the years, Sony has refined the appearance of its Xperia Z range with a few nip and tucks, but has never really broken the mould. It&rsquo;s likely to be the same case with Sony Xperia Z6, which should arrive clad in Sony&rsquo;s iconic glass panels and gorgeous steel frame.</p>
<p>Just like many Sony flagships before it, the Xperia Z6 will surely feature the same (or improved) waterproof rating. The 1080p HD display is rumoured to remain the same, in terms of resolution, as Sony doesn&rsquo;t believe an increase will benefit the size, which is thought to stay around 5.2-inches.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8305" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8305" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Sony-Xperia-Z5-green.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Sony-Xperia-Z5-green.jpg alt=&rdquo;We expect Sony Xperia Z6 to don a similarly iconic look as the Xperia Z5&rdquo;>" width="800" height="520" /> We expect Sony Xperia Z6 to don a similarly iconic look as the Xperia Z5[/caption]</p>
<p>Sony may implement its own iteration of 3D Touch, for pressure-induced gestures, just like iPhone 6s. Samsung is apparently gearing up to reveal its iteration on Samsung Galaxy S7.</p>
<p>Expect the same or similar 23-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front camera, as well as 4K video shooting. On top that you&rsquo;ll probably see a fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button, and a potent Snapdragon 820 processor coupled with 3/4GB RAM.</p>
<p>It might prove difficult to predict the timing of the Sony Xperia Z6 launch, chiefly because the suggestions that Sony is abandoning its 6-month release cycle, in favour of an annual one. As such, you might see it at the MWC in February, or, as the bigger hunch would point towards, much later at IFA in September.</p>
<h3>iPhone 7</h3>
<p>The natural thing to presume is that Apple is working on a complete overhaul of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, since it has historically pulled out the big guns every <em>other</em> year.</p>
<p>That means we&rsquo;ll probably see a whole new design that&rsquo;s slimmer (analysts claim somewhere between 6-6.5mm), as Apple is apparently looking to ditch the headphone jack, and redistribute the technology to the lightning charging port. Not ideal if you own a pair of pricey headphones&hellip;</p>
<p>We expect Apple will use high-grade aluminium for the chassis, potentially fashioning it into a new shape. And we hope the whispers of a waterproof design are true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been talk of Apple losing its iconic home button, to increase the size of screen real estate, and allow for a truly edge-to-edge&nbsp;display. This would require the display technology that could read fingerprints, which we&rsquo;re not aware exists yet.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8306" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8306" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/iPhone-7-Concept-from-ConceptsiPhone.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/iPhone-7-Concept-from-ConceptsiPhone.jpg alt=&rdquo;An interesting iPhone 7 concept, from ConceptsiPhone, shows a complete display takeover&rdquo;>" width="800" height="516" /> An interesting iPhone 7 concept, from ConceptsiPhone, shows a complete display takeover[/caption]</p>
<p>The smaller iPhone 7, which we guess will come in at 4.7-inches, might offer a Full HD resolution, stepping up from the slightly higher than 720p HD display on iPhone 6s. Likewise, the larger, supposedly 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus might boast a Quad HD screen.</p>
<p>Camera wise, we might expect the same 12MP and 5MP shooters, with some added technology and software improvements. One interesting rumour that&rsquo;s just surfaced, claims that iPhone 7 Plus will feature a dual-camera for better optical image stabilisation.</p>
<p>Whilst is said to be working on a March release for its fabled iPhone 6C / 5SE, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to get your hands on iPhone 7 until September or October.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Surface Phone</h3>
<p>Until now, the existence of the ever elusive Surface Phone has substantiated to little more than a few hopeful whispers. However, Microsoft has just acquired surfacephones.com as a URL (which redirects to the tech giant&rsquo;s website), fanning the flames somewhat&hellip;</p>
<p>Since the Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL only launched in December 2015, we think a new Microsoft flagship would still be some way off, even if it was in development. So any rumours you hear at this stage are probably thought up at the desk of some tech journalist or blogger, rather than any source leaks.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8307" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8307" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Microsoft-Surface-Mobile-created-by-Nadir-Aslam.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Microsoft-Surface-Mobile-created-by-Nadir-Aslam.jpg alt=&rdquo;Nadir Aslam adopts the style of the Surface Pro 4 for this Surface Phone concept&rdquo;>" width="800" height="534" /> Nadir Aslam adopts the style of the Surface Pro 4 for this Surface Phone concept[/caption]</p>
<p>Much of the speculation, true or not, purports a sizable 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a 64-bit processor with 4GB RAM and an &uuml;ber powerful 21MP PureView Zeiss 6-lens camera. That&rsquo;s not a lot of insight just yet, but it creates some framework for what could be an awesome device. Especially now that the Surface team has taken over the mobile phone division.</p>
<p>When, if ever, will we see a Surface Phone? The Internet maintains that Microsoft has plans to show off another new smartphone at MWC, but it won&rsquo;t be this mythological device (more likely it&rsquo;ll be the yet to be confirmed Lumia 650), for reasons stated above. We might have to wait until October.</p>
