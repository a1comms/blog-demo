<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">McDonald's delivery? I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it!</span></p>
<p>Fast food lovers of Britain, rejoice! You no longer need to pull on your clothes and wander into town, with pockets full of change, to get yourself a tasty Big Mac and fries.</p>
<p>After forming a partnership with UberEats, <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/ukhome/delivery.html#close" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McDonald&rsquo;s has announced</a> that you will be able to order their delicious meals through Uber&rsquo;s app. McDelivery is finally here.</p>
<p>Simply login to UberEats, pick your McMeal, click a button, and have it delivered right to your door. What a time to be alive.</p>

<p>This is the first time that McDonald&rsquo;s has offered delivery in the UK, in its whopping 43-year history. Still, since the food-ordering app (a la Deliveroo and Just Eat) has become something of a phenomenon, it&rsquo;s no surprise that one of the biggest franchises in the world is getting on board.</p>
<h2>How Does McDonald&rsquo;s Delivery Work?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re yet to use UberEats, you may be wondering how McDelivery works. Well, it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>Much like similar apps on the market, all you need to do is create an UberEats account, enter your delivery address and payment details, then start browsing restaurants in your area. You can look at menus on the app and select what you want to eat.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve ordered your McDonald&rsquo;s meal, you get given an estimated delivery time. Then, all you need to do is wait for a knock at the door. The app charges a &pound;2.50 fee for delivery; a small price to pay for not having to leave the house, right?</p>
<h2>So, What&rsquo;s the Catch?</h2>
<p>Well, right now, McDonald&rsquo;s delivery is only running in large UK cities. So, if you happen to live in Birmingham, Brighton, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Scotland, Sheffield, Southampton, parts of Wales and Yorkshire, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. These are the ares that McDelivery is already active.</p>
<p>If all goes well (which, let&rsquo;s face it, it will), we should be getting fries-on-the-go throughout the country. Yes, keep your fingers crossed for a nationwide McDonald&rsquo;s delivery service from UberEats!</p>
