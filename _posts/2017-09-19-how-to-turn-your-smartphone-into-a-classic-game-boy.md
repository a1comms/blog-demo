<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;"><span class="postStandFirst">&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s a Mario!&rdquo; Introducing SmartBoy, the smartphone accessory that lets you get</span>&nbsp;nostalgic with your classic Game Boy titles.</span></p>
<p>Hyperkin, the video game people, have developed this replica of the classic Game Boy, bringing it back from the dead with this awesome phone accessory.</p>

<p>A SmartBoy is the classic Game Boy reincarnated to work with modern-day Android smartphones. The overall look and feel of the SmartBoy is pretty darn cool. You get the classic Game Boy appearance, buttons, and it fits your game cartridges in the back, just like the originals. We love it.</p>

<p>Once your SmartBoy arrives, (and may we add a, whoop!), simply download the apps, insert your smartphone into the device, and make like Dugtrio and <em>'dig'</em> out your old classic push-in Game Boy games. Pok&eacute;mon or Mario is always a good shout, and you are now ready to get cracking, &lsquo;gotta catch &lsquo;em all&rsquo;, after all.</p>

<p>It would be a shame if we never heard the iconic<em>&nbsp;pa-ping</em> of Super Mario, or your classic Pok&eacute;mon titles never saw the light of day again. So, get up in the attic, dust off the old Game Boy tech box, and get out your favourite game titles to relive your childhood. You might be able to finally beat that high score on Tetris.</p>

<p>SmartBoy is compatible with a whole load of Android smartphones, including a host of new devices such as Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy S8<u></u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;S8 Plus<u></u>. Others include, Google Pixel, Huawei P9 Plus, LG G5, and a long list of Android phones that have a USB Type-C only. However, the product won&rsquo;t work with iPhone or other iOS products at the moment. So, sorry Apple fans, you guys will have to wait for now.</p>
<p>The SmartBoy is on the market already for a tidy <a href="http://www.funstockretro.co.uk/hyperkin-smart-boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;60</a>. We certainly think it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>

<p>So, grab yourself a new Samsung Galaxy S8, and your own SmartBoy, and get the gaming nostalgia going.</p>
