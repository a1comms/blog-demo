<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">What could be worse than drowning? Drowning in molten liquid rubber, maybe. Watch the video below.</span></p>
<p>Getting a shiny new <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-black" target="_blank">iPhone 7</a> can, paradoxically, be both a simultaneously exciting and terrifying experience. Confused? Well&hellip;</p>
<p>In the palm of your hand, you have the very latest tech from the gurus at Apple. It amounts to a beautiful, but oh-so precious bundle of &pound;600+ worth of materials and hardware, that, with one, accidental drop, could shatter right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>Yes, you know those conflicting feelings. The feelings that lead many of us to carrying our new iPhones around like we would our first born child, carefully shielding it from the external terrors of the world.</p>
<p>Still, there are some people out there who aren&rsquo;t <em>quite </em>as vigilant of their phone as others. It may surprise you to learn that there are actual people, living amongst us, who adore nothing more than pushing iPhones to their very limits, and in some cases, torturing them.</p>
<p>From dropping an <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-7-drop-test-from-the-worlds-tallest-building" target="_blank">iPhone 7 off the top of the world&rsquo;s tallest building</a>, to <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/watch-will-this-giant-gummy-bear-shield-your-iphone-from-an-arrow" target="_blank">firing an arrow straight through one</a>, we&rsquo;ve seen our fair share of Apple obliteration over the last few weeks. But the latest in this trend of phone destruction takes us down a previously untrodden path of oddity.</p>
<p>Well, the (not-so) good folks at TechRax decided to test out what would happen if you subjected iPhone 7 to a bout of waterboarding, using&hellip; liquid rubber. In a rather bizarre experiment, one YouTuber teasingly poured the rubber all over the device, and left it, helplessly, to set over a course of five hours.</p>
<p>Why? Well, he wanted to find out the answer to the question that baffles us all: Can iPhone 7 withstand torture by liquid rubber, and survive to tell the tale? Check out the video below to see what happened next.</p>

<p>A mere five hours later, the rubber had completely set around the iPhone. After peeling it off (which looked surprisingly and conveniently simple to do!), the YouTuber performed the necessaries, by checking the iPhone 7&rsquo;s vital signs. Here&rsquo;s where things got interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>While you may presume the worst, the iPhone 7 actually appeared to be absolutely fine. The Home button worked OK, as did the volume rocker; even the screen seemed fully responsive. There didn&rsquo;t appear to be any damage to the outer casing at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the rubber had made an imprint of the phone that could almost be considered artistic. The conclusion is that your brand new sparkly iPhone 7 is probably a whole lot tougher than you imagine. Who knew?</p>
<p>Scores at the end of this round. iPhone 1; liquid rubber 0.</p>
