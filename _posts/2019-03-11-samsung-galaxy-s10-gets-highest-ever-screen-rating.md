<h2>Top of the Class</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The earliest tests on Samsung Galaxy S10&rsquo;s screen have been strikingly positive. In fact, DisplayMate, a website that reviews and rates screens, has given the S10 display a whopping A+ grade. That&rsquo;s the highest possible rating. The site said that the screen is &ldquo;highly refined and mature display technology that now produces the best and highest performance displays for smartphones.&rdquo; Nice stuff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Record-Setting Improvements</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t end there. DisplayMate had a whole load more to say about the new Samsung Galaxy S10 model.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The authors noted that the OLED display performance has continually seen record setting improvements with each new generation. With that in mind, the latest incarnation of this technology is sure to be ahead of the game.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The site also said that the S10 display had &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; level of performance.</p>

<h2>Advanced Colour Accuracy</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to screen quality, one of the most important measures is colour accuracy. This is yet another area in which Samsung has massively excelled.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The review on the site claims that, after colour accuracy testing, the OLED panel got &ldquo;very good ratings.&rdquo; That means that you get an intense level of colour and vibrancy when you&rsquo;re using the new Samsung model. It&rsquo;s sure to be a winning deal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Brighter Than Bright</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, how bright does the Samsung Galaxy S10 screen go? According to the latest review, it&rsquo;s hit a Record Peak Brightness of 1215 nits.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t speak tech, the site clarified that it was 17% brighter than the screen that we previously saw on the S9 model. That&rsquo;s a huge boost!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The review said that this improvement also helped to advance the phone screen&rsquo;s readability and visibility. Samsung&rsquo;s on a roll here!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>"Indistinguishable from Perfect"</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you excited about the Samsung Galaxy S10, there&rsquo;s one more thing you should know.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The screen image contrast accuracy was also rated as &ldquo;visually indistinguishable from perfect.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s seriously high praise.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, you should find that the new panel has a great level of contrast, colour, and brightness. Nice.</p>
