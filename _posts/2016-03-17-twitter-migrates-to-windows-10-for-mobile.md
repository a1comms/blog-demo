<p><span class="caption postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Windows 10 users rejoice &ndash; Twitter has landed on mobile, and both the desktop and tablet apps have been updated with a jazzy new theme.</span></p>
<p>Twitter has finally launched its social and news orientated app for the mobile version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Last July, Twitter rolled out versions of its app to Windows 10 PCs and tablets, presumably delaying the mobile variant until Microsoft released a range of Windows 10 smartphones into the market &ndash; which started from December 2015.</p>
<p>From today, Windows 10 mobiles like Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL have access to Twitter, which can be downloaded for free from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/apps/twitter/9wzdncrfj140" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>The Twitter app for Windows 10 Mobile boasts some added features, helping you discover content more seamlessly, like Moments &ndash; the place to go for finding out new stories and &lsquo;the best of Twitter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 for mobile app also features Direct Messages, video shooting, editing and posting, Tweet sharing and quoting, and the ability to view top Tweets without logging in. It&rsquo;s now closer than ever the successful iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>Twitter also stole the opportunity to announce an update to its desktop and tablet versions, as requested by users, adding a dark theme. You can switch to this new theme in your Twitter settings, under &lsquo;Personalisation&rsquo;.</p>
