<h1>iOS vs Android vs Windows Phone</h1>
<p><span class="postStandFirst">Windows Phone 8.1 has now been officially unveiled by Microsoft, and there have been some rather nice changes to platform. Now it&rsquo;s time to take a look at those changes in more depth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5639 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/windows-phone-8d-1024x546.png" alt="Windows Phone 8" width="960" height="511" /></p>
<p>More specifically, it&rsquo;s time to pit the big 3 operating systems, and find out which is better? Is Android, as found in the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5, the best? Or is that title reserved for iOS, as found in the iPhone 5s? Or perhaps Windows Phone, as found in the Nokia Lumia 1520, is the best? Come to that,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;there even a &ldquo;best&rdquo;, or is it a case of each OS being best&nbsp;<em>for different people</em>?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>This category is always going to be based on a subjective judgement, as all three of the big platforms are rather pleasant on the eye. Things may have been different when they were first introduced (early Android&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t a pretty OS), but nowadays, all three look gorgeous, whether you&rsquo;re looking at the constantly updating Live Tiles of Windows Phone, the widget-based wonder that is Android or the elegant simplicity of the iOS interface.</p>
<h2>Customisation</h2>
<p>Both Apple and Microsoft have a clear-cut idea about what smartphone interfaces should look like, and as such, allow for&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;customisation, but it is admittedly limited (pretty much to changing wallpapers, as Windows Phone 8.1 will now allow this with Live Tiles). Android is the clear winner in this case, as it allows you to not only customise the UI as you see fit, but even throw the stock UI away and install your own from Google Play!</p>
<h2>Ease Of Use</h2>
<p>This category is going to be a close-run thing, between&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;of the competing platforms, because while Android is indeed uber-powerful, it seems to have a little bit more of a learning curve than either iOS or Windows Phone. Of those two, iOS is arguably the more intuitive platform, according to its users, but then, Windows Phone users say the exact same thing about&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>Once you get into the nuances of each, though, it&rsquo;s fair to say that all three platforms are nice and easy to use, although you might be able to get into using the platform slightly&nbsp;<em>quicker</em>, in the case of iOS and Windows Phone.</p>
<h2>Virtual Assistant</h2>
<p>Windows Phone 8.1 finally gives the platform its own virtual assistant, and while iOS had the first (Siri) and Google arguably has the fastest (Google Now), Windows Phone now has the coolest. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s named after, and uses the original voice of, Cortana from the&nbsp;<em>HALO</em>&nbsp;games. As well as that, it supposedly uses new semantic technology, meaning it might even be more accurate than its rivals!</p>
<h2>App Availability</h2>
<p>This final category is the area where Android and iOS outdo their rival Windows-based rival, as they both have a much wider range of apps available. However, it should be noted that while some apps are not available on Windows phones, the majority of the&nbsp;<em>big name</em>&nbsp;apps are; it&rsquo;s just that the other two platforms offer a lot&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;apps besides those.</p>
<p>Thus, we can reach a&nbsp;<em>possibly-not-that-surprising</em>&nbsp;conclusion: there is no &ldquo;best&rdquo; in these three platforms, there is only &ldquo;<em>best for different each individual&rsquo;s needs</em>&rdquo;. If you want a powerhouse phone that&rsquo;s eminently customisable, get an Android phone; if you want a powerhouse phone that&rsquo;s elegantly simple, get an iPhone; and if you want a powerhouse phone with a really cool video game-inspired virtual assistant, get a Windows phone.</p>
<p><strong>Whichever you choose, you can be absolutely sure of getting the perfect phone for your needs!</strong></p>
