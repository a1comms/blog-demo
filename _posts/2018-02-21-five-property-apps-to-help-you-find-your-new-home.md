<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Happy house-hunting with these property apps.</span></p>
<p>Moving to a new house is one of the most stressful things you will ever do. That&rsquo;s a fact. But, what few of us forget, is that finding the right property can be just as tricky.</p>
<p>There are just so many options out there (and a whole load of obstacles), that you may not know where to start. And, let&rsquo;s face it, perusing your local estate agent&rsquo;s window hardly seems a practical way of doing it any more.</p>
<p>Luckily, as always, your smartphone has your back.</p>
<p>These days, there are apps for just about everything. So, it should come as no great surprise that you can get more than a few property apps dedicated to helping you find your dream home. Here are five that you may well want to try for yourself.</p>
<h2>1) Rightmove</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16707" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fKZbT7iyDCJKoUtKVEIWBXRvirZnIJPCZ1WJt9JDhUSxjSZG-ztLXA3-Lro_wPiR1K3yXcqb5sHcsIuNC4l133JbhQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Perhaps the most popular on the list, Rightmove is the first port of call for many house-hunters out there. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to rent or buy a new home, you can find all that you need here.</p>
<p>The app is packed with helpful filters that make finding your new place super easy. You can also check out useful information like where the nearest schools are and even contact agents directly through the app.</p>
<p><em>Download Rightmove for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/rightmove-app/id323822803?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rightmove.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</em></p>
<h2>2) Zoopla</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BiIjFXKoO5k" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Similar to Rightmove, Zoopla is a property searching app that makes your hunt oh-so-simple. You can use filters to search different areas and look for a house that suits your needs. The best feature here, though, is something called &lsquo;Zoopla Estimate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having a little trouble trying to figure out how much a certain home is worth, the feature will take care of that for you. You can get an accurate estimate of any property&rsquo;s value on any given day at the mere touch of a button. Simple.</p>
<p><em>Download Zoopla for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zoopla-home-property-search/id380932800?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoopla.activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</em></p>
<h2>3) Sun Seeker</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3ENGG6Drww" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>And now, for a seriously niche property search app. If you&rsquo;re a sun-lover and want to make the most of the morning rays, you will adore this particular app. Sun Seeker shows you which way each property faces and at what time of day it will catch some sun.</p>
<p>The tool even has a 3D view of homes or a birds-eye one so you can check out where the rays fall depending on the house. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, it comes complete with engaging visuals, graphs and data tables.</p>
<p><em>Download Sun Seeker for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sun-seeker/id330247123?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ajnaware.sunseeker&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</em></p>
<h2>4) Crime Map England &amp; Wales</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16706" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mk0zi9z6iF5DmvaRYL9lgN0Oq-VeyGmqancXGA559onfvQt-Ia47KIfE-wQUQ3E6W11z_vASbgRIBbGH1mWWWXE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, when you move to a new place, you want to feel safe and, crucially, know that you <em>actually are safe</em>! Most people know that you can look up high-crime districts online, but did you know there&rsquo;s a handy app that will do all the hard work for you?</p>
<p>Crime Map England &amp; Wales pinpoints just where crime and anti-social behaviour is happening. Use the app to check out areas where you&rsquo;re house hunting to make sure they're safe and that you still want to move there. Since finding out as much as possible about a place is key, this app is a must-have.</p>
<p><em>Download Crime Map England &amp; Wales for free on iOS or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ravensoft.crimemapuk&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>.</em></p>
<h2>5) AroundMe</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16711" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rzLl2JEbORKLT_obOAT6X6UZCMIB_JXPSxtdW1VvLXVtVc9AW6UgLVyxyZQ0q3V33-eEk-lRGv9eLnlx9qeiwMg-=s0" alt="" /></p>
