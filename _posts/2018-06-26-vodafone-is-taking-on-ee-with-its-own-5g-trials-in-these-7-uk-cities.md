<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Welcome to the future!</span></p>
<p>Make no mistakes &ndash; the world is on tenterhooks waiting to see what miracles the mysterious 5G will bring. The latest move is certain to mean that we can all do more things with our smartphones and will likely take us into a new technological era.</p>
<p>So, while 4G was a <em>huge</em> step up from its predecessor, we&rsquo;re ready to see what the next generation of mobile internet will bring. Luckily, we won&rsquo;t have to wait much longer&hellip;</p>
<p>The good people at <a href="https://mediacentre.vodafone.co.uk/pressrelease/5g-trial-seven-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone</a> just made a rather exciting announcement &ndash; it will be launching an epic 5G trial across seven cities in the UK. The trial will include some of the country&rsquo;s biggest urban areas, including Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester and will start some time between October and December 2018.</p>

<p>Vodafone has already started the groundwork (literally) at sites all over the country and are preparing for the big launch. That means that people in the above cities will be able to test out some of the latest tech features at the touch of a button. The likes of 5G will change the way we use both VR and AR, for instance.</p>
<p>A statement from Vodafone UK Chief Executive, Nick Jeffery, said, &ldquo;We want to make 5G and new fibre broadband services available to consumers and business throughout the UK, delivering a Gigabit society for all. We will also be bringing ultra-fast 4G to several hundred sites in hard to reach rural areas this year, building on our position as the network that offers the best voice coverage in the UK.&rdquo; Exciting stuff!</p>

<h2>The Gigabit UK 2020 Plan</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the trial that Vodafone has up its sleeve. It&rsquo;s actually part of a much bigger plan, which its called &lsquo;Gigabit UK.&rsquo; The idea is that everyone in the country will have access to one gigabit per second (or even more) when getting online by the year 2020. The plan will see a huge rollout of 5G capabilities and loads of upgraded WiFi too.</p>
<p>This news comes after the likes of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/get-ready-for-5g-data-speeds-as-ee-announces-first-uk-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EE announced their 5G trial</a>, which will take place in London in October. The trial will see 10 sites around the country&rsquo;s capital take on 5G and is sure to give people a taste of what the future holds. However, Vodafone are the first to offer a trail of this nature outside the Big Smoke.</p>
