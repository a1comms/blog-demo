<div>The point is, these are the three fundamental possessions we need on our person, just to feel safe and secure</div>

<p>A comedy folk band from Liverpool, called The Lancashire Hotpots, has even written a song in tribute to this universal truth, calling it, unsurprisingly, &lsquo;Keys Wallet Phone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So as you can see, this really is a thing and it&rsquo;s probably more of a prevalent issue than you think. So much so, that the fear of not having your mobile phone with you has become an official phobia: nomophobia.</p>
<p>The UK Post Office coined nomophobia, short for &lsquo;no mobile phone phobia&rsquo;, in 2010, after conducting research into the level of anxiety suffered by people who&rsquo;re absent from their mobile phone.</p>
<p>According to the findings, which might surprise some of you, a whopping 53% of us experience anxiety when we lose our mobile phone, run out of battery, or have no network coverage.</p>
<p>It turns out that men tend to handle separation from their smartphones with a little more difficulty than women, with 58% suffering from nomophobia, compared to 47%.</p>
<p>Even when we finally manage to prise ourselves from the constraints of our busy lives, and jet off to somewhere warm and worry-free, we still can&rsquo;t let our smartphones go.</p>
<p>The study found that 42% of people take their smartphones to the beach with them, and 28% regularly check work emails whilst abroad.</p>
<p>Fred Touchette, a security analyst at AppRiver (the firm that commissioned the survey), said, "It's pretty clear that we're a society totally reliant on our phones not only for personal use but business use too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touch&eacute;, Touchette, you've hit the mark. When you get your hands on a smartphone as intuitive, functional and elegantly engineered as the Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 or iPhone 5s, why wouldn&rsquo;t you want it with you at all times?</p>
<p><strong>Modern smartphones have become the personal, social and business hub, or nucleus if you will, to our lives. When you think about it, it&rsquo;s no real surprise that the majority of us can&rsquo;t separate ourselves from them, is it?&nbsp;</strong></p>
