<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Watch out Apple and Samsung, there's some serious competition coming your way.</span></p>
<p>This week, a range of new Huawei phones have been officially announced, and you may be a little surprised at their names. Yes, we&rsquo;ve leaped from the former P10 devices all the way to the P20 &ndash;&nbsp;skipping everything in between.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason for that too. Oh yes, the Huawei P20 series are set to seriously up the brand&rsquo;s game, positioning it right at the top with the big boys, Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t wait to get your hands on one of the new P20 smartphones, you may not know where to start. The manufacturer is releasing not one nor two new devices, but three. So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s what you should know about the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20 Pro</a> and P20 Lite.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hCAE4FckNU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design: All-Screen Beauty</h2>
<p>The sudden name change isn&rsquo;t the only clue that Huawei is entering a whole new era. The design on the P20, P20 Pro, and P20 Lite is like nothing we&rsquo;ve seen from the brand before.</p>
<p>Boasting a glass front and back, metal frame, and curved edges, these smartphones look super modern and in line with the best flagship phones on the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17071" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U8b6_3jEWzRLkkTXjxmlmpM_NlUONZDoWkryLHiU0_snLzSNkvIa4-zf1Bbb4eEB3dEiZorxsouxppMz2M9v6aB6lg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to compare these new Huawei devices to iPhone X, with its all-screen design and little notch. Which, by all accounts, can only be a compliment. Because who doesn&rsquo;t think iPhone X is a stunning mobile phone?</p>
<p>In terms of size difference, Huawei P20 Pro is the largest of the lot at 155 x 73.9 x 7.8 mm. But not my much. Then there really are just a couple of millimetres between the P20 (149.1 x 70.8 x 7.7 mm) and P20 Lite (148.6 x 71.2 x 7.4 mm).</p>
<h2>Display: Minimal Notch</h2>
<p>Of course, to really compete, these Huawei devices need large screens. Luckily, this is an area in which the Chinese brand has delivered.</p>
<p>Both Huawei P20 and the P20 Lite sport an ample 5.8-inch screen and an LCD panel, while the P20 Pro is a little larger at 6.1 inches, and has a OLED display. You may notice a slight difference in picture colour between the phones, since OLED and LCD don&rsquo;t offer the same warmth of image.</p>
<p>All devices in the P20 range boast an FHD+ resolution (1080 x 2244 pixels), which is all the clarity you need on your smartphone, to make streaming shows and movies from Netflix an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17057" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AKIvsN8LIAqSVa10NqHu4NeTPHh_CjoYetd5VSophMr22geeZXk0-Sks0E-VL_Rcq9PKsx1T4dBfyvCfXq4P6_s=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting again that the displays have a small notch on the top of the screen, as you can see. However, this particular notch is actually smaller than Apple&rsquo;s, meaning that it makes for a slicker and more minimal display. Nice!</p>
<h2>Features: No Headphone Jack? Free Wireless Headphones Instead</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXfOZpe4Uww" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Before we get down to talking about what features the P20 range has, let&rsquo;s talk about one that they don&rsquo;t: the headphone jack. Yes, if you&rsquo;re hoping to listen to music using one of these phones, you will absolutely need to get some wireless earphones (or an adapter). Sorry.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, if you pre-order a Huawei P20 or P20 Pro before 6 April, you can claim a pair of free Bose wireless headphones worth &pound;329.95. Erm, yes please.</p>
<p>The P20, P20 Pro, and P20 Lite each come with a fingerprint scanner. Unlike many other modern scanners, this one is on the front of the device (except the P20 Lite, where it&rsquo;s positioned on the rear).</p>
<p>There will be the super-fast charging system, which means no more waiting hours and hours to juice up. There&rsquo;s also a whole load of AI capabilities built into the devices. This is, of course, where Huawei plans to excel. What that actually means is yet to be seen, but it certainly intrigues.</p>
<h2>Camera: Best in the Business?</h2>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of AI, it will be interesting to see how this feature is incorporated into the cameras. The Huawei P20 comes with both an RGB sensor and a monochrome sensor. The idea is that this should give a real depth to pictures and an overall better image quality than we&rsquo;ve seen on previous models.</p>
<p>The camera specs are top notch too with a 24-megapixel front-facing camera and a 20-megapixel f/1.6 camera on the monochrome side too. The Pro is the star of the show as it will also have a triple-camera setup on the rear.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRd8EmY5MdU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the choice of a whopping 19 different camera modes, which should please Instagram lovers. Plus, there&rsquo;s a whole load of modes, including Pro Mode, different lighting settings, autofocus, 960fps super slow motion, and loads more.</p>
<p>While the reviews are yet to come rolling in, all of the above means that the devices are sure to give every phone a run for their money.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage: Plenty of Both</h2>
<p>It should come as no major surprise that the Huawei P20 phones will come complete with Android 8.0 Oreo. Huawei P20 and P20 Pro will feature the latest, powerful Kirin 970 chipset, and 4GB and 6GB RAM respectively, which will tear through tasks no problem.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17070" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JHudj0FYeEePNzZV-q1WspJjmZnKivciPyvVYfab1OinQaQS-jdDLEnMycz318n7k5BeK4EGEEORuGJnUVu0BY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Huawei P20 Lite offers a slightly watered-down performance, however, featuring a Kirin 659 chipset. It does come with a healthy 4GB RAM, though, so no worries there.</p>
<p>Battery life has been taken care of. Huawei P20 Pro comes with a 4000 mAh unit, the P20 3400 mAh, and P20 Lite 3000 mAh.</p>
<p>Likewise, you get plenty of storage on all three devices. The Huawei P20 and P20 Pro especially, which both some with 128GB of storage as standard. And the P20 Lite offers a still generous 64GB, with the option to expand further by up to 256GB via a microSD card.</p>
<h2>Prices and Release Dates</h2>
<p>So, when can you get your hands on one of the Huawei P20 devices? Well, you won&rsquo;t have to wait all that long. In fact, you can pre-order them now, with the official release set for 6 April.</p>
<p>The prices are more than reasonable, with the P20 costing <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;599.99 SIM free</a>, and the P20 Pro coming in at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;799.99</a>. Believe it or not, Huawei P20 Lite will set you back just &pound;328.99.</p>
<p>All three devices are available on contract and finance, to help you spread the cost.</p>
