<p><span class="postStandFirst">As 2014 draws to a close, we cast our eye back over the year, and choose our list of the top ten smartphones of 2014.</span></p>
<p>The last 12 months has seen the release of some really rather amazing smartphones; processors have grown faster, screens have grown sharper and cameras have started to use <i>sorcery</i> (more on that in a second), and as a result, the entire mobile world has evolved.</p>
<p>But which are the best of the best? Let&rsquo;s find out, as we take a look (in no particular order) at our top ten smartphones of 2014...</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 4</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5395" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/15155510088_0724092e7d_k-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4" width="672" height="672" /></p>
<p>Imagine the Galaxy Note 3; now imagine that it has a UV sensor, a feature which hasn&rsquo;t been seen in <i>any</i> previous phones, that it has a pin-sharp new Quad-HD screen, and that Samsung has built in a whole new set of tricks for the S-Pen stylus. That, in a nutshell, is the glorious Samsung Galaxy Note 4!</p>
<h2>iPhone 6</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6076" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Picture1-1024x327.png" alt="Picture1" width="768" height="245" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, at least one of this year&rsquo;s two iPhones was always going to be on this list because, well, <i>it&rsquo;s an iPhone</i>, and the iPhone&rsquo;s popularity just speaks for itself. The iPhone 6 marks Apple&rsquo;s first foray into big-screen phones, and it&rsquo;s also a great phone, so it&rsquo;s definitely earned its spot on this countdown!</p>
<h2>Moto G 4G</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6046" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/moto-g-4g-lte-2014.jpg" alt="moto-g-4g-lte-2014" width="539" height="303" /></p>
<p>The rule is this: when you&rsquo;re looking at budget phones, the new yardstick they&rsquo;re all measured against is the Moto G 4G. It takes everything that made the original Moto G so amazing, adds in 4G data access, and still <i>somehow</i> manages to give you the best value for money <i>ever</i> seen in a smartphone!</p>
<h2>HTC One M8</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5665" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/13423829115_1e3028056d.jpg" alt="HTC One M8 Mini" width="500" height="395" /></p>
<p>Next up is the HTC One M8, and we all know what the stand-out feature is: that Duo Camera, with its two sensors, that appears to be made out of <i>magic</i>. If you want to feel like a sorcerer, being able to change the focus of a photo <i>after</i> you&rsquo;ve taken it is a really good way to do just that!</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S5</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4752" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" width="538" height="548" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gorgeous, it&rsquo;s unbelievably powerful, and it&rsquo;s water-resistant. It is, in fact, the Samsung Galaxy S5, the next evolution of Samsung&rsquo;s flagship range, and it&rsquo;s awesome (and the electric blue version is one of the prettiest colours ever seen on a phone)!</p>
<h2>Sony Xperia Z3 Compact</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6078" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/xperia-z3-compact-gallery-04-1240x840-094c91770d9add70e8aee7cb743c8f05-1024x693.jpg" alt="xperia-z3-compact-gallery-04-1240x840-094c91770d9add70e8aee7cb743c8f05" width="605" height="409" />Imagine if you took the power of a top-end phone, and then shrank it down to make a kind of fun-sized superphone. That&rsquo;s precisely what the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact does, creating a superphone that&rsquo;s perfect for smaller pockets!</p>
<h2>Nokia Lumia 635</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4598" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Lumia-635-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="Nokia Lumia 635" width="768" height="384" /></p>
<p>The Moto G 4G may be the best value for money ever seen on a phone, but this little Windows phone is giving it a <i>serious</i> run for its money. Packed with exactly the same software features as its top-end siblings, the Nokia Lumia 635 is a glorious (and really funky, what with all those colours) little phone!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;iPhone 6 Plus</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6083" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/apple-iphone-6-plus-1.jpg" alt="apple-iphone-6-plus-1" width="292" height="334" /></p>
<p>The iPhone 6 Plus is Apple&rsquo;s <i>other</i> foray into the world of big screen phones. In fact, it&rsquo;s actually Apple&rsquo;s first <i>phablet</i>, designed to take big rival Samsung in the genre of device that the Korean manufacturer actually <i>invented</i>. If you always wanted to use iOS in a phone with a super-sized, this is the device for you!</p>
<h2>Blackberry Passport</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6084" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Passport_black_front-1024x819.jpg" alt="Passport_black_front" width="768" height="614" /></p>
<p>This one might seem like an odd phone to include, but we can&rsquo;t help respecting a company that has a unique vision for a product, and that then forges ahead to release that product no matter what anyone says. That product is the Blackberry Passport, the square-screened phone that&rsquo;s optimised for reading text&nbsp; (like emails, for example). It&rsquo;s unique, it&rsquo;s unprecedented, and we can&rsquo;t help but love it because of that!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;LG G3</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4212" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/LG-G3-2-847x1024.jpg" alt="Great alternative to the Amazon Fire phone" width="406" height="491" />Finally, we come to the phone that kick-started the era of Quad-HD screens, the magnificent LG G3. It has the sharpest screen in Christendom, it has a &ldquo;Laser Focus&rdquo; camera, it has a ridiculously powerful processor, and it&rsquo;s all wrapped up in a strikingly pretty body. Smartphones don&rsquo;t get much better than this!</p>
<p><strong>And there we have it, our top ten smartphones of 2014. Do you agree? Disagree? Which smartphones would <i>you</i> choose? </strong></p>
