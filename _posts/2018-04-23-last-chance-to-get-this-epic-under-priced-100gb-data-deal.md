<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This might be the best deal of all time. What&rsquo;s the catch? You don&rsquo;t have long to get it.</span></p>
<p>Hold the phone! We&rsquo;ve got news. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new mobile, there&rsquo;s a serious offer that you need to know about. We&rsquo;re here to tell you how to bag a cool Razer Phone with a whole load of data for a ridiculously low price.</p>
<p>The flagship Razer Phone is usually &pound;699.99 when you buy it SIM free. This incredible deal lets you get the phone for just &pound;30 per month over a period of 24 months, and for that price, you get an epic 100GB data, along with unlimited minutes and texts.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. We double, then triple checked the numbers.</p>

<p>Just to highlight how ridiculously good this deal is, listen to this. The total you&rsquo;ll pay over the contract is &pound;720. Bearing in mind the Razer Phone itself is worth &pound;699.99, that means your data, texts and minutes will cost you just &pound;20.01 in <em>total</em>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 83p a month&hellip; for 100GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts. Yes, you&rsquo;re still reading this correctly.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know and how to get this epic under-priced 100GB data deal.</p>
<h2>More Than Just a &lsquo;Gaming Phone&rsquo;</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;ve heard about the Razer Phone, it&rsquo;s probably that it&rsquo;s a phone for gamers.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that this device is built for console-like gaming, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to the smartphone than first meets the eye.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zSsIhOkMgo" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Sure, the beastly processor and 8GB RAM mean that the device is ideal for binge-watching shows and playing games, but what else does this intriguing little smartphone offer?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a rather killer audio system, boasting cinematic quality and a sound like no other. Stereo speaker configuration along with a dual speaker grille mean that you get the highest quality sound no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The battery-life isn&rsquo;t half bad either, which is why you can have epic gaming or watching sessions without worrying.</p>
<p>All the above comes in a neat package that is the Razer Phone. It&rsquo;s sleek, solid, and minimal. In fact, the only distinguishing mark is the now well-renowned Razer logo which is imprinted onto the back of the device. All in all, it&rsquo;s a sweet piece of tech.</p>
<h2>What Can You Do With 100GB Data?</h2>
<p>The world of data may seem like a mystery to many of us but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. If you&rsquo;re having trouble visualising what you can do with 100GB of data, we&rsquo;ve got you covered.</p>
<p>It amounts to around 33 hours of HD streaming on Netflix, 230 hours of video call, or 20,000 song downloads. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, it also gives you total freedom when surfing the net. You can browse online for around 5,000 hours without eating up all your data. Nothing could be better.</p>

<p>Basically, with a 100GB data plan, you&rsquo;re unlikely to run out before the end of the month. Plus, you can connect your other devices to your Razer Phone, and tether up to 30GB data of your allowance each month. You might not even need home broadband at this rate!</p>
<h2>How to Get This Epic Deal</h2>
<p>If you want to get Razer Phone with 100GB of data for just &pound;30 a month, you&rsquo;re going to need to act fast! This epic deal ends at the end of April, and may never be back. That means you only have a week to get yours.</p>
