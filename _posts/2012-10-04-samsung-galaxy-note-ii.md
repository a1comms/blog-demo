<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Samsung Galaxy Note II is still the same device that we all know and love, only much much better!</span></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 10px;" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/samsung_galaxy_note_2_tmb.jpg" width="81" height="155" /></strong>Dubbed the &lsquo;Everday Creative Enabler&rsquo; the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note II&nbsp;has evolved to provide an incredible viewing experience, with enhanced S Pen functions, and finely tuned multi-tasking capabilities!</p>
<p>The original&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note&nbsp;was a bit of an anomaly&hellip; Was it a tablet or was it a smartphone? No-one could quite work it out and, the fact that it had all the capabilities of a tablet yet made phone calls, brought about the word &lsquo;phablet&rsquo; as an apt description! Despite all of this, the device was exceptionally well-built and was soon a best-seller.</p>
<p>The Note II boasts the same great functions and features, as well as many new ones to unlock your senses and unleash your creativity. To begin with, it&rsquo;s wider yet slimmer which makes it easier to grip. The larger 5.5 inch HD Super AMOLED screen offers better clarity as well as a 16:9 screen ratio to allow for the ultimate viewing experience.</p>
<p>A quad-core 1.6GHz processor, teamed with a 3100mAh battery, ensures that the device is speedy and efficient, as well as keeping you connected while you&rsquo;re on-the-go.</p>
<p>Featuring Android Jelly Bean 4.1 out-of-the-box, the latest edition to the Samsung family sits in a very elite club being one of only a handful of gadgets to house this version of the best-selling operating system. However, the Galaxy Note II has a couple more unique features tucked up its sleeve, not least Direct Call and Smart Stay, as debuted on the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy SIII,&nbsp; as well as Smart Rotation.</p>
