<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The two best smartphones head-to-head.</span></p>
<p>Looking for a smartphone that turns heads? Well, you may just have found it. Both iPhone X and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus are stellar phones, but which one is best for you?</p>
<p>It's iPhone X vs. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus: Let&rsquo;s look at what you can expect from each and choose the right one for you.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>If something isn&rsquo;t broken, why fix it? At least, that&rsquo;s what Samsung seems to think. The design on Galaxy S9 Plus hasn&rsquo;t really changed in any noticeably way from the previous generation. Not that we&rsquo;re complaining&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it flaunts the same all-screen design, spanning from edge-to-edge for a stunning appearance. It also has a beautifully curved frame to fit more comfortably in your hands. As for available colours, Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus is available in Midnight Black, Coral Blue, and the brand-new Lilac Purple.</p>

<p>iPhone X is Apple&rsquo;s golden child right now, and offers some radical changes over previous generations. The mega-company finally yielded with this device, opting to give the smartphone a near bezeless look. True to the brand&rsquo;s original form, everything about the design is minimal and no-fuss. The colour options are slightly less jazzy, with Silver and Space Grey available.</p>

<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s the small notch at the top of the screen, but that&rsquo;s unlikely to be much of an issue. Needless to say, one of the biggest changes here is the fact that Apple has ditched the home button. Packing a huge screen and not much else, the device feels thoroughly modern.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>In the battle of the screen sizes, Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus comes out on top, boasting a 6.2-inch display with a Quad HD (1440 x 2960) resolution. The 18:5:9 display ratio offers a cinematic view. While the advanced contrast enhancement ensures photos and videos look more detailed.</p>
<p>iPhone X isn&rsquo;t far off in terms of size, at 5.8-inches with a 1125 x 2436 resolution. The OLED screen guarantees stunning colours, true blacks, high brightness and an incredible contrast ratio. There&rsquo;s also the 3D Touch capability built into the screen, that lets you long press it to open up more options.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>From the upgraded DeX features to Bixby&rsquo;s new capabilities, Samsung has done a great job on boosting what was there already. There&rsquo;s also a Facial Recognition feature that you can use to activate Samsung Pay, and AR Emoji to boot. It also has wireless charging and a water resistant IP67 rating. All the above sounds very familiar.</p>

<p>In fact, if you look at what iPhone X has to offer here, you may find some similarities. It features Face ID for quick unlocking and activating Apple Pay. There&rsquo;s Animoji (which works like Samsung&rsquo;s AR Emoji), Siri (Apple&rsquo;s Bixby) and a water resistant IP68 rating.</p>

<p>It seems that both companies believe that these sorts of features are the future of smartphones and, let&rsquo;s be honest, they&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>The two devices are by no means identical, though. For example, Samsung&rsquo;s AR Emoji can be used with third-party apps, whereas Animoji is limited to iMessage. Plus, there&rsquo;s the fact that Samsung has held on tightly to the headphone jack, despite Apple getting rid of it a while back. Plus, there&rsquo;s the fingerprint sensor that Apple has waved bye to, while Samsung has kept going strong.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>These days, a phone is absolutely nothing unless it&rsquo;s got a serious camera under the hood.</p>
<p>Luckily, both iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus deliver in this area. The selfie cameras are impressive, with iPhone X featuring a 7MP unit, against the Galaxy S9 Plus and its 8MP camera. The main cameras are both 12MP, which means that there&rsquo;s little between the two.</p>

<p>Digging a little deeper, iPhone X has an f/2.2 aperture, while the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus has both a f/1.7 and f/2.4 aperture. The image resolutions are exactly the same at 4000 x 3000.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S9 Plus has a Wide Angle Selfie feature, which is certain to please fans. While iPhone X sports Optical Zoom, Face Detection, and Touch to Focus. Both phones are likely to perform well when it comes down to it, though, and so it&rsquo;s worth trying them out before you decide.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s very own A11 Bionic chipset beats at the heart of iPhone X, and it&rsquo;s reported to be one of the most powerful around. Aside from that, the phone comes with iOS 11 (of course!), 64GB of storage (a 256GB version is also available), and a 2716 mAh battery. The latter means that the phone can last for up to 21 hours, and has a fast-charging feature too.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus features a Exynos 9 Octa 9810 chipset, runs on Android Oreo, as well as 64GB of storage, which can be expanded by a further 400GB via microSD.</p>
<p>The battery is a little larger than iPhone X at 3500 mAh, but we should remember that this is a slightly larger device that requires more juice. The Galaxy S9 Plus offers up to 25 hours of user time, which should be enough between charges.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to talk money. If you want to buy the devices SIM free, iPhone X will cost you &pound;999, compared to &pound;869 for Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus.</p>
<p>You can spread the cost if you buy on contract or finance. Right now you can get iPhone X with 8GB of data for just &pound;57 a month. Or, on finance, just &pound;43.90 a month. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus is available with 12GB for &pound;56 a month on contract, and just &pound;38.19 a month on finance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which smartphone is best for you? Well, it&rsquo;s fair to say, that there&rsquo;s very little in it this time around. Both devices are seriously high-end and have the very latest specs. There&rsquo;s no doubt that iPhone X is a revolutionary device, but it does cost a little more. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus has all the tech at a slightly lower price. Whichever you happen to choose, you&rsquo;re sure to have one of the snazziest smartphones ever.</p>
