<p><span class="postStandFirst">The first official Cyanogen Inc phone, the OnePlus One, has now been announced, and it has come with a few surprises, most notably the fact that in spite of including the same power as phones like the HTC One M8 or the Samsung Galaxy S5, the sim-free prices for the OnePlus One will start at a mere &pound;229. That is an impressive price, although it remains to be seen if corners have been cut in producing the phone.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always exciting when a new smartphone is announced. However, it&rsquo;s <em>doubly </em>exciting when that new smartphone is the first <em>ever</em> phone from a whole new manufacturer, and such is the case with the new OnePlus One.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/14004244731_46aa125fdb.jpg" width="500" height="489" /></strong></p>
<p>A lot of information was already known about the new phone, thanks to the people behind it, Cyanogen Inc. We knew that it would run on an official version of their own CyanogenMod (a heavily modified version of Android), and there was also talk about high-end specs, comparable with current flagships like the HTC One M8, or the water-resistant <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>.</p>
<p>We now know that those rumours were true, and the OnePlus One has a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor clocked to 2.5GHz, as well as 3GB of RAM and a 13MP camera. By any definition, therefore, it is most definitely a top-ender! That the manufacturer has managed to announced such a powerful phone within 6 months of the company being founded is surprising enough in itself, but there is one thing even more surprising than that: the price.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, OnePlus, has announced that the sim-free price of this phone will be &pound;269 for the&nbsp; 64GB model, and &pound;229 for the 16GB model. In the same way that the Moto G offered the best value for money of any phone in the mid-range class, this looks like it aims to do the same for top-end phones.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, this may well mean that some compromises have been made in terms of the build quality and so on, but we won&rsquo;t know what this phone is <em>actually</em> like until it gets released. Stay tuned for more updates! </strong></p>
