<p>Have you updated your iPhone or, indeed, iPad, to iOS 12, yet?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, take a moment to do it now. Done? Okay.</p>
<p>The latest Apple operating system is, by all accounts, a pretty major step-up from what we&rsquo;ve seen in the past. If you don&rsquo;t know where to start with the brand-spanking-new update, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the best iOS 12 tips and tricks that you have to try for yourself.</p>
<h2>Call a Bunch of Your Friends</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18757" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wa-elQng4AHsa_otIp6za1srAoCR9OGimVKIRa7YN33SiMoRVlB5wb1RuAGFvIXJJrvo_PYsCVE6OivNN7eeQwHa3g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the biggest changes that Apple has made to the FaceTime app is the Group Call option.</p>
<p>You can now invite up to 32 of your best friends to a video call. Of course, they will all need to have an iPhone with iOS 12 on it.</p>
<p>Simply open the FaceTime app and type the names of your contacts into the To bar and get started.</p>
<h2>Add People to Your Video Chat</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re already chatting with a couple of mates in FaceTime and want to add someone else into the mix. One of you might say, &ldquo;Hey, we should get Sandra in this chat. She&rsquo;s a riot!&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t have to stop and restart the call. You can just click the + sign to add them in. Hi, Sandra!</p>
<h2>Quit Your Instagram Addiction</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18759" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eX2_0o18d7t-l1zh33SvkGm6KUQHuHrkfocRvVk8k99wmYYihirlnrVVPuq1MFZN4k0B6prZ8Nf1WKNKMyMUbXk=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Do you find yourself scrolling endlessly through Instagram for no clear reason? I hear you.</p>
<p>Luckily, Apple has created a new iOS 12 app that allows you to curb your addiction once and for all. When you start using the Screen Time app, it will monitor how much you use certain features of your iPhone or iPad. You can then set limits on certain apps.</p>
<p>Go to the Today page on the Screen Time app and then scroll down to see the apps you&rsquo;ve used. Click on an app that you want to stop using as much (I&rsquo;m using Instagram as an example since I&rsquo;m completely addicted to it!) and then tap Set Limit. You can choose how many minutes you want to use the app for each day, and Screen Time will let you know when you&rsquo;re reaching your limit.</p>
<p><em>Note: You can hit Ignore Limit for 15 minutes or the entire day if you need (or want) to keep using it! </em></p>
<h2>Find Out Which Apps You Use the Most</h2>
<p>Does it feel as though you spend all your free time on your iPhone? One of the most useful iOS 12 additions is another one that lives in the new Screen Time feature.</p>
<p>At the end of each week, you can get full reports that break down what you do with your iPhone. That means that you can figure out how much time you spend looking at certain apps. (Warning: The results of the report may shock you&hellip;)</p>
<h2>Create Your Own Animoji</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18756" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_RmRF7t-MhuL7zP5di2yxkRvrsAGMNuBaOd9VQ9l1Qzs0fh8MA20SHh82DsBmg1MS_AcvJMlCqxnBm6ZnEK-RRj9=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Apple launched Animoji on iOS 11 for iPhone X, allowing you to take control of and animate your favourite emoji.</p>
<p>Now, on iOS 12, you can create your own Memoji, which is exactly what it sounds like. Using customisation tools, you can turn yourself into a personalised and characteristic emoji.</p>
<p>What a time to be alive!</p>
<h2>Give Yourself Some Downtime</h2>
<p>Of course, the main purpose of the Screen Time feature in iOS 12 is what it says on the tin. Getting a view of how much time you spend looking at your iPhone screen, of course. But you can also take steps toward changing it.</p>
<p>The Downtime feature within Screen Time allows you to set periods when you can&rsquo;t be disturbed. For example, you can set this up between 10pm and 7am to avoid any late-night use. You can also tailor this new iOS 12 feature to prevent use of individual apps. Go ahead &ndash; give yourself a break!</p>
<h2>Use Some Cool Text Effects</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18758" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/icJO9cFZo8ICnSFJLTNbx7iyBLMGPlM9SgkOxHO3jrUJWBC8YPA9yhinpMaFgD0zkRkymET6HRgkbfW0qBDeq7A8=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words&hellip; If you&rsquo;re the type of person who sends a load of snaps to your friends, you&rsquo;ll love this next iOS 12 feature.</p>
<p>You can now add text effects to your pictures and videos before you send them in the Messages app. From speech bubbles to cute emojis, there&rsquo;s something for everyone.</p>
<h2>Use Your iPhone to Measure Something</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the new operating system, you may notice a new app on your home screen.</p>
<p>Measure is one of the best new iOS 12 features and could prove to be rather handy in the long run, especially if you&rsquo;re into a bit of DIY.</p>
<p>To use the Measure app, open it and point the camera at a physical object that you want to measure. You will need to follow the instructions to ensure that the focus is right. Then, the app will give you the item&rsquo;s measurements.</p>
<h2>Search for Your Favourite Photos</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18761" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C5khLVclqoscBR4vB6AvTh-CH6mCVKpaftms4T5TX9nubTTPWgWEe36_aAvHSHb9ojR68oo5e_E3E1QoNYMhFsE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Looking for a specific picture on your Camera Roll?</p>
<p>You may no longer have to spend ages scrolling through awkward selfies and holiday snaps. Instead, you can use the smarter search to find what you need. Type keywords into the search bar at the top of the app and see what you find.</p>
<p>You can also search by location, i.e. where the picture was taken, to quickly find that photo you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<h2>Autofill Your Passwords</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you will likely have a bunch of passwords for different apps and online services. It can all feel like a bit of a mess. One of the best iOS 12 tips and tricks you can use is the new and improved Autofill Passwords feature.</p>
<p>When you next need to sign into something on your phone, you can use Face ID or Touch ID to do so. Of course, you will need to make sure that the passwords are saved on your Keychain first!</p>
<h2>Take Control of Your Notifications</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18760" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Esq3CtSr_13MSOKBE6ZDTxoYwzFUHBe-_lK5eLu-1pl9yGSsh7qPu6E0J-j8YtV73QCIdgbOOj0KQosngdHR2zHP=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>With the iOS 12 update, long gone are the days of tapping your iPhone screen to see an endless stream of updates. Yikes.</p>
<p>The latest version of the operating system takes a smarter approach when it comes to notifications. Conversation threads (in WhatsApp, for example!) and similar topics are grouped together. That means that you can see the most important thing on your phone at just a glance.</p>
<h2>Reply to Messages Super Quickly</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re busy, it can be tricky to stay on top of all your chats and conversations. Sometimes, you only need to show the person that you&rsquo;ve read their message and agree.</p>
<p>The Tapback messages iOS 12 feature allows you to do just that. Touch and hold the notification to quickly respond to a message with an expression like a thumbs-up or heart.</p>
