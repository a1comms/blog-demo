<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">One will apparently fold like a "cosmetic compact"&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Reports have surfaced claiming that Samsung is just months away from announcing a pair of bendable smartphones, including one that can fold in half like a compact mirror.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Samsung boldly claimed it would have the technology to create such a mind-mending device by 2017, and if the speculation is true, Samsung is set to deliver.</p>
<p>One of the two rumoured devices, which may potentially be unveiled in early 2017, is reported to feature a 5-inch display that unfurls into a larger 8-inch display. From smartphone to tablet in two seconds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-07/samsung-said-to-consider-phones-with-bendable-screens-for-2017-ip4tgwz9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg </a>has claimed that these won&rsquo;t be flagship models with the greatest available specs, but will serve more as an experiment for Samsung, in order to dip its toe in the water and test market demand.</p>
<p>Samsung has been pioneering new screen formats since the release of its curved-edge display on Samsung Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge, so you can bet if anyone is going to lead the charge on fully flexible screen technology, it&rsquo;s the South Korean tech giant.</p>
<p>Such a development may also help give Samsung the edge over Apple, by far its biggest rival in the industry. And with the fabled iPhone 7 expected to launch in 2017, it&rsquo;s likely to be a particularly significant year of competition between the two.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Woo, an analyst at IBK Securities Co. in Seoul said, &ldquo;This product could be a game-changer if Samsung successfully comes up with a user interface suitable for bendable screens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next year is a probable scenario. Their biggest obstacle was related to making transparent plastics and making them durable, which seems resolved by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Codenamed &ldquo;Project Valley&rdquo;, the phones may emerge&nbsp;as soon as Mobile World Conference, in February 2017.</strong></p>
