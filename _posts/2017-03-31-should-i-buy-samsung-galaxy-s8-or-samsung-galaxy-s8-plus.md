<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here are the facts to help you work out which Galaxy S8 is perfect for you.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Samsung fan, spring often brings some rather exciting news. Yes, by the end of April, both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus will be available to buy from us.</p>
<p>But wait, <em>which</em> new Samsung smartphone should you buy? You may have a fair few weeks to make this somewhat life-changing decision, but it&rsquo;s by no means one you should take lightly.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we have the down-low. We&rsquo;ve pitted the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus against one another, in a gruelling battle of technological greatness. Here&rsquo;s everything that you need to know to help decide which Samsung you should buy.</p>
<h2>Best for Performance</h2>
<p>As with any flagship device, you can expect these phones to have top-notch performance. Samsung has kept quiet about the chipsets it's used in each of these, but we do know a little about them.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are certain to be faster and slicker than previous devices, simply because they&rsquo;re packing a large 10nm octa-core chipset. The unnamed chip is sure to be either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or the Exynos 8895. Both of which are absolute powerhouses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13614" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tPB7ZAZtrQlvLjPlDbgWpE_aKdE2mFSfzWTyfXgZkxJln6AXrMyrdL1h3vWUyRTn5HFTmxIAB3u174gLbw4HzPj53g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>In truth, both phones will offer a similar experience and performance to each other, and will handle games, apps and movie streaming like an absolute boss.</p>

<h2>Best for Your Palm</h2>
<p>Possibly the only drawback of the Galaxy S8 Plus is this: It&rsquo;s a little tricky to hold and use the entire screen with just one hand. This is, of course, part and parcel of having a larger phone. The problem is, our hands don&rsquo;t grow with it. So, with the Galaxy S8 Plus sporting a whopping 6.2-inch screen, this could feasibly be an issue for some users.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13630" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--lf7HLzvjh5JSiAGLtZVbBKq-0e0BHxotYNV66ndo8NDGhzvO_rcL_b9pKBjiLJzmhO0YEv8KRqWb5joYjDWoo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the flip side, Samsung Galaxy S8 is a little smaller, coming in at 5.8-inches. While that may not seem a hefty difference, it does aid the usability of the device. In short, it&rsquo;s far easier for your finger to stretch the length of the phone and, hence, use all its functions with one hand.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a palm-friendly device, opting for the smaller Galaxy S8 could be the way forward for you.</p>

<h2>Best Display</h2>
<p>The larger display <em>does </em>offer the Plus some advantages, though. If you&rsquo;re looking for a crisp-looking aesthetic, this phone certainly has a lot to offer. It boasts a 2960 x 1440 (Quad HD) resolution, with 529 pixels per inch, which translates to a simply ridiculous level of detail. And because the screen is larger at 6.2-inches, you can better see and experience the extra quality, more so than on a smaller display.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13608" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6aI5IfsSXZZ7RfQEc_4cbmXQYeBbnu4U-QHmA6-nUq9rLx1hs0llQWDlGHZngBCs-R4uko9pkAFf4eFNnPBF_eLp0Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Should you opt for the Samsung Galaxy S8 instead, you may notice some minor differences. While the phone still has the same 18.5:9 aspect ratio as the Plus and a QHD resolution, it&rsquo;s display is sure to be a little weaker. If you&rsquo;re into nabbing the most pixels per inch, paying a little more for a larger screen and better display.</p>

<h2>Best Battery Life</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the type of user who&rsquo;s gets as much as they can out of their smartphone, battery life is sure to be a major selling point. Of course, there are now more portable battery packs on the market than ever before, but who can be bothered with the faff? What you want is a Samsung smartphone with a beast of a battery.</p>
<p>There is a difference in this field between the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. (Although, you may like to note that the batteries are the same size as&nbsp;Galaxy S7 and S7 edge). The smaller Galaxy S8 houses a 3000mAh unit, whereas the larger Galaxy S8 Plus comes in with a chunky 3500mAh battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13631" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iaxOFia2h_Y-e3BOHvzfT34Apk0aecQv0gywmxF1gvxUeqtEC6QOi-7U78_rcE_FRanvbeOJjkE-sH0wW9gkfn5=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>That may sound like a big deal, but remember that the Galaxy S8 Plus will ultimately use more power to fuel the bigger screen. Saying that, you can still expect a longer battery life. So, if you&rsquo;re worried about running out of juice when you&rsquo;re on the go, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is the phone for you.</p>

<h2>Best for Your Budget</h2>
<p>While we wouldn&rsquo;t describe either Samsung Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus as a budget handset, you do get your money&rsquo;s worth here. Both flagships offer an advanced interface, stunning new designs, cool new features like the iris scanner and lots more besides.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a bit of a difference in terms of price, between the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. As you may have guessed, the smaller sized Samsung smartphone is the more affordable of the two. Prices are subject to change, so we recommend getting a live update using the links below.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s no question about&nbsp;which new Samsung Galaxy is better the budget-conscious. If you&rsquo;re looking for a quality device that&rsquo;s better on price, the Galaxy S8 wins hands down.</p>

<h2>Best Overall</h2>
<p>Really, there isn&rsquo;t much that separates these two Samsung smartphones. Both have killer cameras, powerful processors and incredibly detailed displays. The main points of difference are of course the size, with the Galaxy S8 Plus sporting the larger screen, as well as a better battery performance. Though these features do come at a slight premium over the smaller Galaxy S8.</p>
<p>If you want as much display as possible, with more room to watch, play and browse, then choose Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. If, however, you&rsquo;re happy enough with a display that&rsquo;s still big (just not <em>as</em> big), and want to spend a little less, then of course you should opt for the Galaxy S8. Hopefully, that clears everything up for you, and you&rsquo;re well on your way to settling on a decision.</p>
<p><em>Hint: there is no wrong decision here - both are awesome mobile phones!</em></p>
