<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Mate, where did you get those earphones!?</span></p>
<p>Whether you admit it or not, we all love a freebie! There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the feeling of getting something a little extra without having to part with your hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>Here at Blog.Buymobiles.net, we want to help you out. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re giving you the chance to get some awesome free earphones when you get a new mobile. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Meet Huawei Mate 20 Lite</h2>
<p>Packing an almost bezel-less display and a cool, futuristic design, it&rsquo;s clear to see why so many people are absolutely obsessed with the Huawei Mate 20 Lite. It&rsquo;s a high-end looking device with a reasonable price tag. Of course, the 6.3-inch Full HD+ display is enough to win most people over, but that&rsquo;s by no means all that this phone has to offer.</p>
<p>Photography is the main aim of the game and the device boasts some of the most advanced cameras on both the rear and the front. Bonus: The cameras are powered by AI, which means that you can take stunning photography with each and every snap.</p>

<h2>The Free Earphones</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s my strong belief as a music-lover and a human being that we should all invest in a quality pair of earphones. Why put up with tin-like, mediocre sound, am I right? The Active Noise Canceling Earphones 3 from Huawei are some of the best out there. Offering Hi-Res audio, wind noise reduction, and USB-C plug and play, you can&rsquo;t get much better. Plus, they come with three different audio modes:</p>

<h5>Travel Mode</h5>
<p>Find travelling super stressful? You&rsquo;re not alone. For many people the whirring noise of a plane or train can be a serious disruption. Switching the earphones to &lsquo;Travel Mode&rsquo; could be the answer. The mode filters out so-called ambient noise so you can chill. Phew.</p>
<h5>Normal Mode</h5>
<p>When you&rsquo;re relaxing in a cafe, you want to drown out much of the noise around you. That&rsquo;s where &lsquo;Normal Mode&rsquo; comes in. You can still hear a little of the noise around you but the main focus will be your music (or entertaining podcast!).</p>
<h5>Aware Mode</h5>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t always ignore the things around you. If you&rsquo;re walking in the street or sitting at work, you need to make sure that you&rsquo;re aware of your surroundings. &lsquo;Aware Mode&rsquo; allows you to listen to your music while still letting in other sounds.</p>
<h2>How to Get The Earphones For Free</h2>
<p>If you like the sound of the Active Noise Canceling Earphones 3, we&rsquo;ve got a great little deal for you. You can bag yourself the earphones &ndash; which usually cost &pound;59.99 &ndash; for free at Buymobiles.net. All you need to do is buy the Huawei Mate 20 Lite to get the earphones thrown in at no extra cost. Nice.</p>
<h5>But You&rsquo;d Better be Quick!</h5>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only got 30 pairs of earphones to give away, which means that if you want to nab this freebie, you&rsquo;re going to need to be as fast as possible. Order the suave new Huawei phone now before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
