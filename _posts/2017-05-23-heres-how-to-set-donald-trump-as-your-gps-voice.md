<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This is not fake news.</span></p>
<p>Ask yourself this very simple question: What could possibly make your commute to work better?</p>
<p>(Or much, much worse).</p>
<p>You might be thinking, a free cup of coffee? Or someone else driving your car for a change? More accurate traffic reports? Or, just maybe, the US president helping you navigate your journey? If that last idea has you jumping for joy, you&rsquo;re in real luck.</p>
<p>(Though you may want to get yourself evaluated by a medical professional. Sad!)</p>
<p>If you happen to have the <a href="https://kartagps.com/">Karta GPS</a> app on your device, you could be in for something of an American-themed treat. Yes, the company has integrated a rather weird feature on its latest software update. You could soon be driving along to the sound of Donald Trump (well, a Donald Trump <em>impersonator</em>), making Sat Navs great again!</p>

<p>Saying that, you&rsquo;re probably sat there questioning why on earth anyone would want Trump to navigate their trip. But before you get all up in arms, remember that almost 50% of Americans voted for him. Maybe, just maybe, there&rsquo;s someone out there who couldn&rsquo;t imagine a better guide.</p>
<p>Whatever your reason for wanting Trump to shoot directions at you, it&rsquo;s never been easier to get his voice on demand. The Karta GPS app includes Trump&rsquo;s impersonated voice as standard, so you can simply select the option and get set out on a new&nbsp;trip. The best trip. Hey, everybody will tell you it's the best. So beautiful.</p>
<p>Of course, it may seem a tad partisan to include just only one president&rsquo;s voice over. We&rsquo;re guessing that&rsquo;s why the Portuguese company also added an impersonated Bill Clinton to the GPS app. What could possibly be better than that, eh?</p>
<p>Aside from the questionable selection of voices, Karta GPS is actually pretty snazzy. It works with Foursquare and Yelp to create a completely synced up experience. And, while you may not be sure about Trump guiding you home, it&rsquo;s got a whole range of speakers from which to choose. Nice.</p>
