<p>Ikea has recently announced it will now be stocking domestic solar panels for your home, at a shiny price tag. And before you say anything, no, they don&rsquo;t come flat packed with self-assembly and instructions with a stick man scratching his head, there installed for you.</p>

<p>Phew, now you&rsquo;ve got your Sunday afternoon back, here are the details. The package includes solar panels and a battery. Alternatively, you can just have one or the other to suite you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Installing solar panels enables you to save up to 50% on your electricity bills, at the same time as generating clean energy for your home. <em>&ndash; Ikea.com</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In recent years, solar power technology has become significantly cheaper since its introduction, which back then exclusively saw large installations for business and agriculture.</p>

<p>Nowadays though, solar is a lot more accessible, so give yourself a radiant smile. With an initial investment of only &pound;6925 you can solar power your home, which could pay back in 12 years or so. Catching those rays will have never felt so good, as you glare over those electricity bills and watch the figure go down instead of up for once.</p>

<p>Although it may seem a big investment initially, it can pay dividends in the long run, accumulating to hundreds in savings on your electricity bills, and of course, the reduced carbon emissions from using a renewable technology. This tells the neighbours you&rsquo;re doing your bit for the planet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&hellip;installing a typical home solar system is the equivalent of having 55 trees in your back garden.&nbsp;<em>&ndash; Ikea.com</em></p></blockquote>

<h4>The rise of smart home tech &ndash; somebody sync me!</h4>
<p>So, solar panels, another tech toy to add to the ever-growing list of home and personal tech thingamajigs. But, let&rsquo;s face it, all this new gear is here to save us money and designed to blend in. Take the Nest home system for instance.</p>
<p><strong>Nest</strong></p>
<p>The Nest system gives you savings and efficiencies from firing up your boiler via an app on your way home.</p>
<p>The clever learning capability of the Nest can learn from your daily habits, and crank up the temperature to ensure you have your morning coffee with the house just right.</p>
<p>Sync your Nest with your Google Home device for ultimate hands free control. Also, with phone app integration, you'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to simply turning the heating down.</p>

<p>Automate further and let the beat drop, as well as the bills, with these other home assistant products.</p>
<p><strong>Google Home, Apple HomePod and Amazon Echo</strong></p>
<p>Google Home is compatible with your home tech, including music streaming and TV's, while Googles Home Assistant can keep you organised. Alternatively, Amazon Echo and Alexa could keep you company, and are equally compatible with your home tech and smart lighting. The Apple fans may prefer the HomePod and Siri. However, the main difference here is you may only be able to sync up with Apple partnered products, maybe giving you fewer options.</p>
<p>A sure found way to integrate all these systems in the home is through lighting. Tech such as Philips Hue lighting can be controlled by voice, further reducing your energy consumption and adding some va-va-voom to your ordinarily boring home lighting, as they come available in funky colours.</p>
<p>In addition to solar panels, Ikea has also launched smart bulbs compatible with our household tech, like Google Home. Who'd of thought you could control your home lighting with your voice in 2017?</p>

<p>Imagine combining your solar technology into products like these too, crazy.&nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be much longer before we have as much gear in our homes as Wallace and Gromit! Cheeeeese.</p>
