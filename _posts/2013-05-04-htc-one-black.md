<p><span class="postStandFirst">The HTC One is one of the best phones of 2013 so far with its premium build, killer specs and unique software... plus it&rsquo;s now available in a sleek matt black finish.</span></p>
<p>Already a contender for smartphone of the year, the HTC One is an incredible handset.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8113/8700995377_98723f2a1e_m.jpg" width="146" height="240" />Sporting state-of-the-art specifications, such as the exclusive Ultrapixel camera, an immensely detailed full HD display and a set of rich front facing speakers, the HTC One has it all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Packed to the rafters with innovation, running on Android Jelly Bean 4.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8554/8702118970_26a52979df_m.jpg" width="142" height="240" />1 and overlaid with the sense operating system, this device features such software gems as BlinkFeed, a live news feed that brings in all your favourite news, reviews and social network updates to one central point, and Zoe, a innovative camera shooting mode geared to making life easier, and more interesting!</p>
<p>The design of the HTC One is something to be marvelled at. Crafted from aluminium and precision machine drilled, the One is a thing of elegance and beauty.</p>
<p>Originally available in silver, HTC has now released the Black variant which gives the device a new and stunning look. The slim bezels perfectly match with the display edges creating a unified front,&nbsp; whilst a mixture of matt blacks, plus a slight curve the the rear, all add up to make the HTC One Black stand out from the crowd.</p>
