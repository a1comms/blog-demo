<p>Unboxing videos have become a staple of the tech world. If you haven&rsquo;t seen them before now, you&rsquo;re missing out. Each time a new device or gadget comes out, there are endless vloggers and the like just waiting to get their unboxing clip up for all the world to see.</p>
<p>Usually, these videos are pretty tame. Someone quite literally &lsquo;unboxes&rsquo; the gadget and shows the camera just what&rsquo;s inside. It might sound dry, but the truth is that these videos help people to understand what they are getting for their money and often serve as an initial review of the product to boot.</p>

<p>Recently, though, the people at T-Mobile decided to take this nifty little trend to a whole new level. Rather than merely unboxing the device and showing it off in all its glory, they thought it would be a good (um, really?) idea to unbox it underwater&hellip; with sharks.</p>
<p>For this daring, extreme unboxing challenge, the T-Mobile folk chose the Samsung Galaxy S8. The flagship phone was released just a week ago and has already received a whole load of attention from the media. Aside from looking extremely high-tech and bearing a frankly humongous screen, the phone boasts some impressive &lsquo;water resistant&rsquo; qualities too. It was just that that T-Mobile wanted to test.</p>
<p>The SGS8 unboxing was recorded underwater where a daredevil T-Mobile staff member, called Des, took the box of the device. While he looks relatively safe in the shark cage, you will fast notice that there are deadly sharks swimming around him as he completes the challenge. The whole thing is quite difficult to watch, which is exactly why you should take the time to see it!</p>
<p>Of course, this is a mere PR stunt and not something that you ought to try for yourself at home. (Though, why you&rsquo;d have shark-infested waters in your house, I&rsquo;m not quite sure&hellip;) As you will see in the official SGS8 unboxing, there are extras and accessories in the box that are not waterproof at all. What&rsquo;s more, Samsung say that the device is water-resistant in up to five feet of water for no more than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So, rather than risking your tech and quite possibly your life by doing your own SGS8 unboxing underwater, it makes much more sense to just do it in your living room. After all, you will be safe and dry there&hellip; Win win.</p>
