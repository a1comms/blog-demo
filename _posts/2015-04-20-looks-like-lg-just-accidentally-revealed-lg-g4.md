<p><span class="postStandFirst">LG has accidentally unveiled its next superphone a couple of weeks early, and we now have a pretty good idea of what the phone (i.e. the LG G4) will be like. In short, just like its predecessor, it&rsquo;s shaping up to be rather awesome indeed...</span></p>
<p><strong>The LG G3 was undoubtedly one of the nicest smartphones of 2014, with a super-fast processor, a &ldquo;Laser Focus&rdquo; camera, and an ultra-sharp Quad-HD screen that had to be seen to be believed. It was, quite simply, utterly fantastic.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6590" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/LGG4-Invite-01-650-80.jpg" alt="LGG4-Invite-01-650-80" width="650" height="366" /></p>
<p>And now, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/11/lg-g4-leak/">Engadget</a>, LG has accidentally unveiled this year&rsquo;s successor to the G3...</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called (completely unsurprisingly) the LG G4, and you can see the heritage of the phone just from taking one look at it; other than one <em>very</em> notable difference (more on that in a second), it&rsquo;s <em>almost </em>a dead ringer for its predecessor. Well, it is from the <em>front</em>, anyway, although it lacks the metal effect &lsquo;chin&rsquo; below the screen. It&rsquo;s from the back, however, that the big difference becomes apparent: the LG G4 will have a range of different options for the backplate, including <em>leather</em> backplates.</p>
<p>And why does it need a removable backplate? Simple: unlike the LG G3, the G4 has a removable battery.</p>
<p>It also has a 5.5-inch screen, and once again it uses that unspeakably sharp Quad-HD resolution of 2560x1440 pixels. While there&rsquo;s no word, yet, on what processor the LG G4 will use, we&rsquo;re going to go ahead and assume that it&rsquo;ll be screamingly fast, just like its predecessor (and also, that it will have a lot of RAM, and thus, will be absolutely brilliant).</p>
<p><strong>There are a few details like that missing from the list of specs (and the page has now been pulled, naturally), but the launch event for the LG G4 is due to happen on April 28th, so we won&rsquo;t have long to wait until we officially see the phone in all its glory. Stay tuned for more news!</strong><br />
