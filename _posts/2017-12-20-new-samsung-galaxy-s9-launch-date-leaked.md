<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It might be earlier than you think.</span></p>
<p>The new year is almost upon us, which means that it&rsquo;s time to start looking forward to the fantastic new technology that 2018 has to offer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, with Samsung Galaxy S8 now a fan-favourite, many of us are hankering to get a glimpse of the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/samsung-galaxy-s9-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming Galaxy S9</a>. So, when can we expect to see it?</p>
<p>The wait for the next Samsung flagship phone could soon be over, with rumours flying left, right, and centre about when the device is being released.</p>
<p>In a leak, first reported by The Bell (via Ausdroid), it&rsquo;s claimed that the phone is be unveiled on 27th February 2018. Bloomberg is now also reporting a late February release date.</p>

<p>This is earlier than some previously expected. This year, Samsung Galaxy S8 was announced late March, which led many to believe that the follow-up Galaxy would appear at around the same time the following year.</p>
<p>After all, many manufacturers (a la Apple) tend to stick to a fairly rigid schedule when it comes to releasing new smartphones. With that in mind, an April release date wouldn&rsquo;t be out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>However, there could be a reason for the earlier date. It just so happens to coincide neatly with the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018.</p>
<p>MWC starts on 26th February 2018, and would be a prime place for the Samsung team to announce its latest line of smartphones, going on sale shortly after. There&rsquo;s usually a press event the day before, in fact, which would provide the ideal platform to let the world know just what Sammy has in store for us.</p>
<p>In the past, Samsung has used MWC to announce big name devices, including some from its Galaxy S flagship series. So it&rsquo;s entirely possible that the latest Samsung Galaxy S9 release date rumours are true&hellip;</p>
