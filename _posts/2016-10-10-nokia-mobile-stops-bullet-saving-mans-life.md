<p>Since the dawn of the mobile phone, there&rsquo;s been one brand that we all unanimously agree is totally indestructible. Drop it from a building, flush it down the loo, or throw it at the wall when you&rsquo;ve lost your high score on Snake. No matter what you put a Nokia phone through, it always seems to survive to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Still, while these phones may seem unbreakable, how do you think they&rsquo;d fair should one come up against a bullet? In the deep, dark, depths of the internet there are many stories both weird and wonderful - and, of course, this one is no different.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, a guy called Peter Skillman shared a rather surprising image on Twitter. The picture in question shows the Nokia 301 with what appears to be a bullet lodged inside it.</p>
<p>Along with the image, which I am sure you&rsquo;ll agree is quite something, is Skillman's rather matter of fact&nbsp;tweet. He&nbsp;writes, &ldquo;A Nokia phone I worked on a few years ago saved the life of a man in Afghanistan last week. The embedded bullet...&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re to believe this story, it&rsquo;s one of the most jaw-dropping tales in Nokia&rsquo;s history. It could be a scene from a Nokia sponsored action movie in which the protagonist is just about to be undone by a bullet straight to the chest. As it rips through him, our character topples backward in agonising pain.</p>
<p>The audience is sure he&rsquo;s dead. No one could survive that blow. This is the end for sure&hellip; But then, a subtle twitch of a finger. The audience gasp. A few moments later, he smugly reveals the secret of his survival, pulling out the bullet encrusted in his trusty Nokia. Luckily, it was in his breast pocket the whole time.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that this story seems, well, just a little far-fetched.</p>
<p>The people of the internet seem to think so, as well as some Twitter users who were quick to point out the flaws in this guy&rsquo;s brief tale. After receiving lots of messages asking for specifics, Skillman replied by revealing that the Nokia 301 was given to him by a co-worker. He also tweeted out a link from 2012 to a strikingly similar news post.</p>
<p>Other Twitter users pounced on the opportunity to share some amusing Nokia memes. Because why not.</p>

<p>Whether you believe it or not, it&rsquo;s a heart-warming story (and an excellent opportunity for Nokia!). Just to be clear, though, you should <em>never </em>use or depend upon a mobile phone for armour. While Nokias may have a reputation as indestructible bricks, you should draw the line at ballistics.</p>
