<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Coming soon: the next gen of mobile network!</span></p>
<p>Tech is taking great leaps and bounds forward. However, the faster it moves, the faster we need our networks to be.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the latest generation of mobile network &ndash; 5G &ndash;&nbsp;is going to be a real game-changer. When you actually get to use it will depend on your provider and where in the country you live.</p>
<p>The likes of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-is-launching-the-uks-first-5g-mobile-from-this-manufacturer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EE and other providers</a> have already put their fork in the ground here. But, if you&rsquo;re on O2, you might be wondering when the miracles of 5G will be coming your way.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you won&rsquo;t have to wait too long. Executives from the company just made a rather large announcement about what we can expect this year and the next.</p>
<p>Yes, the network provider will be rolling out its <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5G services across the UK</a> soon enough. The first four cities to benefit from these capabilities will be Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret if you don&rsquo;t happen to live in any of these major cities. The service will be launching across the UK later when 5G will be more widespread.</p>

<h2>5G Will 'Launch With a Bang'</h2>
<p>&ldquo;5G is a promise of so much more &ndash; for consumers, business, industry and public services. &nbsp;O2 is working in partnership with British industry, encouraging businesses, big and small, to engage with the possibilities of 5G technology through both our tested programme and launch deployment,&rdquo; says Mark Evans, CEO of Telef&oacute;nica UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O2&rsquo;s 5G network will arrive this year and we want the next-generation of mobile services to launch with a bang. 5G will benefit customers from launch, with better speeds and improved customer experience. Following the demand from our FTSE 100 trials, we are extending our testbed opportunities so that businesses of all sizes can work us to build the 5G Economy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>New 5G Innovation Spaces</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, O2 will also be creating new &lsquo;5G innovation centres&rsquo; across the country so that businesses can test the capabilities of the network.</p>
<p>Companies of all sizes, including FTSE 100 and leading British businesses, will have the chance to access these capabilities in the near future.</p>
<p>The provider says that this will help &lsquo;fuel innovation&rsquo; as well as helping to encourage the economy after the knock of Brexit.</p>
<p>Needless to say, O2 is now asking companies in all sectors of trade to partner with them as part of this campaign and start enjoying the marvels of 5G tech. However, it&rsquo;s not merely the business world that will benefit here.</p>
<p>The everyday customer &ndash; that&rsquo;s you! &ndash; will soon get the chance to give 5G a whirl.</p>
<p>Should you have a compatible device and live in one of the first four cities to get the network, you can expect to start using it at some point this year. If you live elsewhere, the brand new service will be hitting your phone next year. Exciting stuff.</p>
