<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than the following scenario.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mid-argument with someone, and you&rsquo;re looking for a word that accurately sums up your bitter feelings. As the madness boils in your brain, you do what any sane person would&hellip; You decide to use <em>that</em> word. You know which&hellip; No, not Voldemort. The F-bomb.</p>
<p>You see pure red as you type it out and frantically press send. <em>Ha!</em> that will show them once and for all&hellip;</p>
<p>But moments later, you realise your mistake. Or, rather, your iPhone&rsquo;s poorly timed auto-correct, having censored your use of the f-word, instead opting for a less impressive 'duck.' Your momentary satisfaction fades away and you&rsquo;re left with nothing but the stinging humiliation of being outdone by Apple&rsquo;s ducking auto-correct, yet again.</p>
<p>This is a situation that&rsquo;s all-too-familiar to Apple users. For some reason, our iPhones seem to behave like a nagging aunt at times, insisting we watch our language. But we&rsquo;re adults, right, with a commanding use of profanities. If we want use a naughty word, we <em>will</em>.</p>
<p>The question is: how do you get around this pesky problem?</p>

<p>Journalist Steven Thrasher tweeted out a totally awesome life hack that you may want to try yourself. You see, if you put the word in question into your contacts list (as seen above), your phone will never again try to stop you using it. While this idea is quite honestly brilliant, it does have one major drawback. How on <em>earth </em>are you going to explain the fact that you have such an unfortunately-named contact in your phone?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d rather not fill your phonebook with obscenities, there is another option. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. There you can input all sorts of colourful words into your &lsquo;safe list,&rsquo; giving auto-correct the middle finger and restricting its prudish powers so you can eff and jeff all you like. Thank duck for that.</p>
