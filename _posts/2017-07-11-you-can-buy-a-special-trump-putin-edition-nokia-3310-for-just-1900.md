<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If there&rsquo;s one thing that can ruin the Nokia 3310&rsquo;s iconic reputation, it&rsquo;s this.</span></p>
<p>Just in case you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention to world events, last week two powerful presidents came face-to-face. As part of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in person for the first time. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree, this is an historic moment that the world may come to recall for years and years to come&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, whenever a colossal event such as this one takes place, there&rsquo;s always a load of eager companies out there ready to capitalise on it. So, it should come as no great surprise that you can now buy Trump/Putin merchandise online.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting Trump/Putin product available, though, is a special edition gold and titanium Nokia 3310, commemorating the meeting of the two presidents.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14225" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pLOPRqFVRJ6c2qLCzNFi3BBxd7P6UbZVCXOsvTQAoPnKPiyquIE6ix-QQIidkQOjP8XOANn-Kuje9n0pag3TKT0=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>With a &lsquo;tempered titanium&rsquo; and &lsquo;damask steel pattern&rsquo;, as well as large gold stamp of both Trump and Putin, this Nokia 3310 is as hideous and tacky as you probably predicted it would be.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that there are no words to quite do this thing justice. Well, as it turns out, Caviar, the company selling the phone, managed to find a few. Here&rsquo;s what the (Google translated) product description says about the bizarre piece of memorabilia:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<em>In honor of the meeting of the Russian and US presidents, Caviar created a collection model of the Nokia 3310 with portraits of the leaders of the two countries. For the first time profiles of both presidents are placed on one device. The fact that their views are directed in one direction - no doubt expresses the general desire to achieve progress in Russian-American relations. </em></p>

<p><em>However, we should not forget about the principles and firmness necessary to protect justice and our own interests, the interests of our country - in order to emphasize precisely these features, the designers used tempered titanium with the damask steel pattern. The design of the phone also interprets the emblem of the G20 summit and indicates the date and venue of the historic meeting.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>So, what do you think? If you&rsquo;re sold on the idea of carrying a retro feature phone around with you, embossed with the heads of Trump and Putin, get ready to part with 149,000 rubles, which comes in at just about &pound;1,900.</p>
