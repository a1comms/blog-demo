<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony is, once again, aiming to dominate another section of the smartphone market with a new Xperia smartphone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/sony_xperia_m.jpg" width="157" height="320" />Sony has been on a mission of late, aiming to conquer all fields of the smartphone market by producing an Xperia handset for everyone... and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/sony/sony-xperia-m">Sony Xperia M</a>&nbsp;is certainly one not to be missed!</p>
<p>The Sony Xperia M is a neat little handset that is poised to take the low-mid range by storm. The device is not only great looking, featuring Sony&rsquo;s trademark design flare, with an assortment of colours available and a slick curved body, but also packed with a whole host of premium features.</p>
<p>With a 4 inch TFT display that is both crisp and clear, with great viewing angles, the Xperia M has a great screen for a handset in this market.</p>
<p>The device is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor and 1GB of RAM. With Android Jelly Bean 4.1straight from the box the Xperia M is snappy and responsive. It also benefits from having 4GB of internal memory on-board which can be expanded via microSD card up to 32GB.</p>
<p>On the rear of the device, the Xperia M houses a 5 megapixel camera with LED flash which, coupled with Sony&rsquo;s own imaging software and dedicated camera key, make for a great photo experience. There is also a front-facing camera that can be used for video calling.</p>
<p>The device is one of the few handsets in its market that supports Near Field Communication (NFC) meaning that you can share content with other devices using just one touch, and instantly pair the phone to wireless speakers, headphones and even compatible televisions.</p>
<p>Powering the handset is a 1750 mAh battery that will provide plenty of use for running apps, games, music and web browsing.</p>
<p>The Sony Xperia M is shaping up to becoming another smash hit for the technology giants, offering looks, functionality and most importantly great value.</p>
<p>The Xperia M should be hitting the market some time in June.</p>
