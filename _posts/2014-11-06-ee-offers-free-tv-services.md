<p><span class="postStandFirst">EE is now offering a new deal for people who sign up to both mobile and broadband packages, in the form of a free EE TV set-top box, to let you watch and record TV on your actual television, your tablet, <i>and</i> on your smartphone!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-6019 aligncenter" alt="EE TV" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/1413971318178-1024x292.jpg" width="960" height="273" /></p>
<p>Not content with being the first 4G network in the UK, nor with becoming one of the fastest mobile networks in the entire world (by way of offering a 4G+ data connection in parts of London), EE now has a new plan to tempt customers onto its network.</p>
<p>EE is now giving away its new TV service, EE TV (including a set-top box), to people who sign up to both a mobile and a broadband plan with the network.</p>
<p>So, what do you get with EE TV?</p>
<p>At its simplest, EE TV offers you 70 Freeview channels, as well as streaming services like iPlayer and Youtube, directly through the set-top box.</p>
<p>That set-top box can also record programs (it has a 1TB hard drive built in), and can record four separate channels simultaneously; that&rsquo;s especially useful since the box can connect up to four separate devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6020 aligncenter" alt="EE TV" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/1415016144803.jpg" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>The best part, however, is that those four devices don&rsquo;t have to be televisions. You could, in fact, connect up your smartphone (whether that&rsquo;s an iPhone 6, or a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, or whatever phone you happen to be using, although it will most likely need to be a phone on EE), and watch live TV on your mobile, or, of course, on a tablet.</p>
<p><strong>You will need to sign up for both a broadband and mobile package to take advantage of the deal, but if you&rsquo;ve been looking for a net TV service without having to use someone like, say, Sky, then EE may well have just given you the perfect solution!</strong></p>
