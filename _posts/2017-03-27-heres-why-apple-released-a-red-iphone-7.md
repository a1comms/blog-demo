<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">And no, it&rsquo;s not just because it <em>looks</em> pretty!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re about to <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee?upgrade=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upgrade your mobile</a> and finally get that snazzy <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>, there&rsquo;s something you should know: there&rsquo;s a new special edition iPhone 7 in red now available, alongside the five original colours.</p>
<p>Yes, iPhone 7 PRODUCT(RED) is here, which means that you can now get the latest Apple device in a fiery, shiny crimson.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13573" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MSHHNxdmeqIqDnDf6DPLz5hYWVaVo6J5_YzI0kdGNx8E3wdogbhgP78rjNdSlvOZ4tqo7ztu-oTJlOjI-Ou495pN=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Why Red?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the colour of this new iPhone that&rsquo;s impressive. When you buy a red iPhone 7 or 7 Plus for yourself, you&rsquo;re contributing to a very good cause along the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED is part of a charity campaign run by both Apple and <a href="https://red.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RED)</a>.</p>
<p>Not heard of (RED) before? That&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s a charity that the likes of Bono and Bobby Shriver started more than 10 years ago, to help fight AIDS globally. Donations from campaigns like this one mean that the charity can provide life-saving anti-retroviral treatments to those affected by the virus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13577" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ruzfGJYn38XGcnvSNYlLnF_IjvQ4F-QszThr1Swcze3-HpurnxD9q-z7KccZDiOdW0g_nX5Ow9ab91D07eNuA4g-=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have tremendous power. What we choose to do or even buy, can affect someone&rsquo;s life on the other side of the world. In 2005, more than 1,200 babies were born every day with HIV. Today that number is 400. We must act now to get that close to zero. (RED) can&rsquo;t accomplish this alone. It will take all of us to get there &ndash; governments, health organizations, companies, and you,&rdquo; says the official (RED) manifesto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you BUY (RED), a (RED) partner will give up some of its profits to fight AIDS. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Be (RED). Start the end of AIDS now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time that Apple has collaborated with this particular charity. In fact, although you may not have realised it, Apple has been supporting this cause for 10 years. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s managed to raise a whole load of cash for the charity along the way. We&rsquo;re talking a whopping <strong>$130 million</strong> (around &pound;103 million) solely through it&rsquo;s sale of (RED) products.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just proceeds from the Red iPhone 7 that are going towards the (RED) charity, either. Apple has a wide range of products that now come in the signature red colour. From an Apple Watch sportsband, to silicon red cases for your current phone, there&rsquo;s a whole load of choice.</p>
<p>So go on, treat yourself to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus in red, and feel twice as good about it!</p>
