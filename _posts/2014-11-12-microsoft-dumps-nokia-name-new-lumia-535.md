<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">Microsoft has launched the Lumia 535, notable for being the first Lumia phone that does <i>not</i> have any Nokia branding on it. Specifications of the Lumia 535 are distinctly entry-level, although it has a couple of intriguing features in the big screen and the higher resolution front-facing camera, which might turn a lot of first-time phone buyers&rsquo; heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6029" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Lumia-535-hero2-jpg-1024x512.jpg" alt="Lumia-535-hero2-jpg" width="672" height="336" /></p>
<p>When Microsoft bought Nokia, many people wondered how long it would be before we saw our first phone without the name &ldquo;Nokia&rdquo; written on it (since most people assumed it would happen, one day).</p>
<p>And now we have our answer; Microsoft has now announced the Lumia 535, and unlike previous Lumia phones, there is nary a mention of Nokia anywhere on the phone.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Lumia 535 is most definitely an entry-level phone, although it&rsquo;s an entry-level phone with a couple of features to make it stand out from <i>other</i> entry-level devices. The first is a 5-inch screen, although as the phone is being billed as a budget model, the resolution comes in at 960x540 pixels, well below the 1080p resolution of, say, the Samsung Galaxy S5, or the insanely sharp Quad-HD screen on the LG G3.</p>
<p>Just above the screen, you&rsquo;ll find the Lumia 535&rsquo;s <i>second</i> stand-out feature: a 5MP front-facing camera. There has been a spate of &ldquo;selfie phones&rdquo; released already, by various manufacturers, and it seems that Microsoft is intent on tapping into that same market. Powering the whole thing is a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 200 processor, with 1GB of RAM, and there&rsquo;s a second 5MP on the back of the phone, in-line with what we&rsquo;d expect from an entry-level device.</p>
<p><b>At the moment, Microsoft is focusing on releasing the Lumia 535 in markets such as Russia, India and China, but it <i>is</i> due to come to the UK in due course. We don&rsquo;t have a confirmed UK launch date, yet, but we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this one, so stay watch this space...</b></p>
