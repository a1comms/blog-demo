<p><span class="postStandFirst">BuyMobilePhones.net has won the coveted title of Best Online Retailer at the Mobile News Awards 2013.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4155 aligncenter" alt="Mobile News Awards 2013" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2013/03/Awards-2013.jpg" width="180" height="320" /></p>
<p>It was all smiles last night as A1 Comms received well-deserved recognition at the Mobile News Awards 2013 for two of its flagship brands.</p>
<p>BuyMobilePhones.net, the company&rsquo;s long-running online brand, received the prestigious accolade of Best Online Retailer 2013, beating fellow competitors to the top spot.</p>
<p>It was, however, a double celebration for the A1 Comms Group (which also owns online brands AffordableMobiles.co.uk and MobileShop.com) as the Corporate Division of the Group was also successful in securing recognition. A1 Comms Corporate received a commended certificate for the category of B2B Dealer of the Year 2013 &ndash; a great result considering this was the first time the division has ever being entered for an award.</p>
<p>The Mobile News Awards 2013&nbsp;were presented to winners by television personality, comedian, and star of Mock The Week, Dara O&rsquo; Briain, at the London Hilton on Park Lane hotel, London on Thursday 14 March. The ceremony was attended by mobile phone network representatives, as well as retailers, manufacturers and service providers.</p>
<p>Stuart Joce, Managing Director of the A1 Comms Group, said: "We are delighted to finally be able to add this much-coveted award to our trophy cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;This award is testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff, and the loyalty of our customers.&rdquo;</strong></p>
