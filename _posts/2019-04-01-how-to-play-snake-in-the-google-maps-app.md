<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1st April which means that every news outlet and commercial company known to man has a prank planned. Sigh!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of all the fakery today, there&rsquo;s one exciting and completely real surprise coming your way.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, instead of executing a trick this April Fool&rsquo;s Day, the people at Google have decided to give us all a nostalgic treat.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a lover of retro phone games &ndash;&nbsp;and who isn&rsquo;t? &ndash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;re going to want to give this one a whirl for yourself. You can now play a quirky little version of Snake in your Google Maps app.</p>

<p>You should already have Google Maps on your phone. If you haven&rsquo;t got the app, you can download it in minutes via either the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Play Store</a> (Android) or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">App Store</a> (iOS). Easy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve got the app, launch it and hit the menu button at the top left-hand side of the screen. You should see an option at the bottom of the menu that says &lsquo;Play Snake&rsquo;. Hit that button and then press play to open the game.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:html --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Hint: If you don&rsquo;t see the option right away, close down the app on your mobile phone and relaunch it! </strong></p>

<h2>How to Play Google Maps Snake</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fun doesn&rsquo;t stop there &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t your average mobile phone game, not by a long shot. Google Maps Snake can take place in some of the major cities around the world.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you launch the mini game, you get to choose a destination from a list. You can play in cities including Cairo, S&atilde;o Paulo, London, Sydney, San Francisco, Tokyo or, if you&rsquo;re feeling extra adventurous, the whole world!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, rather than playing as a snake, the game is actually based around public transport. So, for example, should you choose to take a trip around San Francisco, you get to play as a tram cart, while in London, you play as a red bus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you move around your chosen map, you pick up people who are waiting for a ride. Of course, should you accidentally crash into the side of the map, the game is over! Why not try it out now and see what high score you can get?!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>Hurry - You Don't Have Long to Play</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you want to get in on the action, you&rsquo;d better move fast. Google has said that the game will be available on its Maps app for around a week. That should be plenty of time to set a record-breaking score.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Oh, and you can also <a href="https://snake.googlemaps.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">play Google Maps Snake</a> in your browser, if you prefer your nostalgic fun to take place on a larger screen.</p>
