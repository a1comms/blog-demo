<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Because sometimes Instagram is hard.</span></p>
<p>The world of social media can be a rather confusing place, especially if you&rsquo;re a celebrity.</p>
<p>When there are hundreds of thousands of people watching your every Tweet, it can feel a little intimidating. Perhaps all that pressure is what leads public figures to ballsing up oh so very badly. Either that, or they don&rsquo;t engage their grey matter before pressing send.</p>
<p>To show you just how wrong things can go for famous people online, we&rsquo;ve compiled 10 of the biggest celebrity social media fails of all time. Read with caution, however, because the following content reveals some skin-crawlingly cringing recounts.</p>
<h2>1. When Scott Disick Forgot How to Read</h2>
<p>Now, we all know that celebs (even the most minor of them) get paid to promote products on Instagram. It&rsquo;s no big secret. But when Scott Disick copied and pasted that caption from an email, he clearly forgot to proofread it. Doh!</p>

<h2>2. When No One Cared About Rita Ora&rsquo;s New Song</h2>
<p>One fateful Friday in 2014, singer Rita Ora posted a Twitter message teasing that she would release a brand new song if she got 100,000 retweets by Monday morning.</p>
<p>Sadly, that figure was a little ambitious. She was forced to delete the Tweet after failing to break the 2000 barrier. Super awkward.</p>
<p>Ora, to her credit, did manage to salvage some dignity, however little, after posting a follow up Tweet in which she claimed her account was hacked&hellip; We&rsquo;ll let you make your mind up on that.</p>

<h2>3. When Kim Kardashian Couldn&rsquo;t Spell</h2>
<p>Since she paints herself as such a fashionista, you&rsquo;d think that Kim Kardashian West would know how to spell Armani&rsquo;s first name, right? Well, when she Tweeted a public outcry after Armani discontinued her favourite foundation, she made one small error that the social media account holder wasn&rsquo;t afraid to point out. Um, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Giorgio&rsquo; <em>not </em>&lsquo;Georgio.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>4. When Ed Balls Tweeted His Own Name</h2>
<p>Ed Balls really ballsed things up with this one. He showed a complete lack of competence when it comes to technology, by oddly Tweeting his own name. Literally, just &ldquo;Ed Balls.&rdquo; We can only assume he was trying to look himself up using Twitter&rsquo;s search bar, possibly to review public feedback, which, you can bet, was nothing but positive...</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ed Balls</p>
<p>&mdash; Ed Balls (@edballs) April 28, 2011</p></blockquote>

<h2>5. When Zac Efron Had Zero Tact</h2>
<p>Back on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Zac decided to tell the world not one, but <em>two </em>things he was thankful for. Unfortunately, the second thing was his own social media success. Here&rsquo;s what he wrote: "I'm grateful for a couple of things today: Martin Luther King Jr &amp; 10 million followers on IG.&rdquo; Of course, he quickly apologised for that blunder.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I have nothing but the greatest admiration &amp; respect for MLK. My last post was insensitive &amp; I apologize to anyone who I offended. So sorry.</p>
<p>&mdash; Zac Efron (@ZacEfron) January 19, 2016</p></blockquote>

<h2>6. When Donald Trump Retweeted This&hellip;</h2>
<p>This next social media fail is in very poor taste, and who else could it happen to other than Donald Trump. A Twitter user, by the name of @feckhead, posted a photo to Trump, claiming the two people in it were the user&rsquo;s late parents, who saw Trump as an inspiration. With the Presidential candidate&rsquo;s ego sufficiently stroked, he of course did RT the photo. Little did he know, however, that the two people features were serial killers Fred and Rose West&hellip;</p>

<h2>7. When Naomi Campbell Did a Scott Disick!</h2>
<p>Much like Scott Disick, Naomi Campbell forgot one small thing before she hit that all-important send button. When sending a promotional Instagram about some Adidas footwear, she left most of her email correspondence in the caption. She had one job, and she still managed to mess it up royally.</p>

<h2>8. When Oprah Accidentally Promoted Apple</h2>
<p>In a tweet promoting the brand new Microsoft Surface tablet, Oprah forgot to take out one tiny thing. In the corner of her tweet was a little clue as to where her alliances really lie. Yep, she forgot to take out the bit that said &lsquo;Twitter for iPad&rsquo;. Now, tell us again how much you love the Surface tablet. Pahahah!</p>

<h2>9. When the World Underestimated Mary J. Blige</h2>
<p>Tired of people questioning her smarts, Mary J. Blige decided to tweet out to the world and hit them with the truth. Once and for all. But here&rsquo;s the thing, in what became a sweet, sweet bit of irony, she misspelt &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; as &lsquo;intelligents.&rsquo; No, Mary. You&rsquo;re not doing yourself any favours.</p>

<h2>10. When Little Mix Made a <em>Little</em> Mistake</h2>
<p>Finally, the ladies behind Little Mix proved that they weren&rsquo;t running their own social media game (who knew?!) with this Instagram post. When promoting their new perfume, the girls managed to leave in some of the email from their PR rep. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this for copy jade:&rdquo; read the caption. Oh dear me. Get it together, guys!</p>
