<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">See who made it to Christmas Number One.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to receive something special this Christmas, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the gift of a brand smartphone light up the festive celebrations. So, whether you&rsquo;re shopping for a loved one, or you're treating yourself, here are five of the best mobile phones money can buy right now.</p>
<h2>5) LG G5</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> New wide angle camera, excellent performance<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Battery life low, unique design</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12683 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/The-Power-of-Three-1.jpg" width="600" height="287" /></p>
<p>If you were familiar with the LG G4, there&rsquo;s one thing that you&rsquo;ll notice immediately about this device. It looks nothing like its predecessor. LG has ditched the leather for a metal, contemporary look instead. It works well for the LG G5, although some users may find the unique design a little intimidating at first sight. The screen is also a little smaller. While the G4 wielded an impressive 5.5-inch screen, this latest model has a mere 5.3-inch offering.</p>
<p>So, what does this brand new phone have to offer? Well, first let&rsquo;s talk about the so-called &lsquo;magic slot&rsquo;. Rather than removing the back of the phone to access the battery, there&rsquo;s now an input system, which means that you can slide it out. Easy peasy.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, there is an accessory port inside the slot, where you can fit certain add-ons (such as a physical camera control) to the device. Neat, huh? You should also know that the LG G5 packs a super-wide angle camera. Of course, the phone also packs the usual LG perks to boot so if you&rsquo;re a fan of the brand, this latest device won&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>

<h2>4) Sony Xperia XZ</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> High-res 23MP camera, water-resistant<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Similar design to previous generations</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12684 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/Sony-xperia-xz.jpg" width="600" height="364" /></p>
<p>Over the years, Sony has produced some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the story's no different with the latest Sony Xperia XZ. At 23-megapixels, this camera packs plenty of detail into shots. Colours look great, too, thanks to the RGBC-IR sensor, so your Christmas tree photos will pop with colour!</p>
<p>As with any kick-ass camera, you don't want to be restricted when it comes to taking great photos. Because Sony Xperia XZ is water-resistant, it doesn't matter whether you're snapping away in the rain or the swimming pool. Wet doesn't mean worry.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12685" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/wet-doesnt-mean-worry.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="266" /></p>
<p>The only real criticism of the Xperia XZ is the design. While it's a good looking phone, with a sleek glass panel build, there's not much to differentiate it between many of the previous generations. It feels like Sony played it safe again this year. But, if you already love Sony's trademark design, what's the big deal?</p>

<h2>3) HTC 10</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Brilliant battery life, great sound quality<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Design a little bulky and in need of an update</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12686" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/htc-10.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a gift for your music-loving family member, HTC 10 is a strong candidate. The major advantage that this smartphone offers is it&rsquo;s all-singing, all-dancing sound quality.</p>
<p>HTC developers made a point to integrate powerful amplifiers into the device, giving users the best possible level of sound when they hit play. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, HTC 10 also makes a personal sound profile based on your hearing, making it the perfect match to you, and you alone. It's a nice personal touch.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12687" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/brilliant-hi-res-audio-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Of course, there are a couple of drawbacks. But nothing's perfect.</p>
<p>The camera hasn't received much of an update since the last model, so, while it's capable of some good shots, don't expect HTC 10 to perform in the same league as iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.</p>
<p>Also, the build looks a little dated when you compare it to the latest from Apple and Samsung. HTC officials seem to have redirected attention away from design in the last two years, which is a shame because design is an area HTC has previously excelled in. That being said, HTC 10 is still one of the best phones money can buy this Christmas.</p>

<h2>2) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> High-quality screen, exceptional camera<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Feels a little too delicate, unrefined UI</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12688" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/s7-e.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Many of you have no doubt already sent your letters off to Santa, pleading for a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. We don't blame you - it's a fantastic smartphone.</p>
<p>The futuristic look of the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge alone may be enough to make it one of the most popular phones of the year. The dual-curved edge is really impressive and sets it apart from petty much every phone on the market right now. It goes without saying that the Quad HD screen is just amazing. It's an area that Samsung really does excel year after year.</p>
<p>Of course, the Galaxy S7 edge's camera is a massive selling point. The 12MP unit is perfect for most to take beautiful photos for your Instagram pages. Especially around the holiday period.</p>
<p>What else? This device comes water-resistant, able to survive 30 minutes underwater. Just in case you spend a little longer than expected in the bath&hellip; And the battery life is pretty awesome, too, especially for such a powerful smartphone.</p>

<p>There are really only two drawbacks. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge feels a little dainty compared to some of the more robust mobiles on the market, and Samsung's UI is a little less refined than the likes of Sony and HTC. Other than that, this is one of the greatest smartphones of 2016.</p>

<h2>1) iPhone 7 Plus</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Water resistant design, dual lens camera<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> Could be <em>too </em>big for some users, no headphone jack</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12691" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/iphone-7.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Without a doubt, the smartphone that caused the most buzz in 2016 was iPhone 7. Even more so, in the case of the larger Plus version, which is certain to be one of, if not <em>the</em> best phones for the festive gift-giving season.</p>
<p>While on the outside the phone may not look all that different to the iPhone 6s (although the casing is now water-resistant), the inside has had something of a power overhaul. iPhone 7 Plus packs the impressive A10 Fusion processor, which gives it the brawn to outperform <em>every</em> previous iPhone.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more exciting, though, is the new dual lens camera (exclusive to iPhone 7 Plus) that offers a 2x optical zoom. With it, you can get closer to the action without compromising on quality. It's ace. On top of that, there's Portrait mode, which blurs out the background to enhance your subject. Engage it, and suddenly your shots look professional-standard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12692 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/portrait-mode.jpg" width="600" height="328" /></p>
<p>Opting for iPhone 7 Plus comes with both pros and cons. On the one hand, yes, the larger screen means that the device is easier to use and more suited to watching films and other media. It offers a perfect balance between a tablet and a smartphone, which will likely appeal to users. However, the extra size probably won't suit everyone, particularly if you're used to a much smaller smartphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Apple has done away with the headphone jack, which means that a standard pair of headphones no longer plug straight in&hellip; You need an adapter, which Apple does kindly include in the box. So it's not much of an issue.</p>
