<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to give a smartphone to a special someone this Christmas, and you're working to a budget, you need to know which handsets give you more value for your money.</p>
<p>We've pulled together five absolute Christmas crackers, all really affordable yet full of great features that mean you won't miss out, just because you didn't buy the most expensive option.</p>
<p>Yep, these are the best low-cost mobile phones available this Christmas!</p>
<h2>5) Moto G4</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12724 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/moto-g4.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s kick things off with one of the best cheap phones on the market right now, the Moto G4. It packs a load of technology for your money.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to rival the top phones on the market at a budget price, you may just have found it. With a 5.5-inch Full HD display, a rather snazzy camera, and a long,<em> long</em> battery life, this phone is ideal.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that Moto really does excel when it comes to making affordable devices right now. It&rsquo;s no wonder that it still makes some of the most popular phones out there.</p>
<p>Of course, when you&rsquo;re paying budget prices, you have to expect a couple of minor drawbacks. As far as the Moto G4 is concerned, these come in the form of the style of the phone&hellip;</p>

<p>One thing you&rsquo;re certain to notice right away is that the handset feels rather bulky and the back of the phone is made of a textured plastic which is less than chic. If you can get over the look of the phone, though, you may just bag yourself a real bargain!</p>

<h2>4) Samsung Galaxy A3 2016</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12726 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/samsung-galaxy-a3-2016.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Hailed as one of the best value mobiles of the year, you can pretty much guarantee that Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 won&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>The 4.7-inch HD display is ultra-sharp and the phone comes with a microSD slot, should you wish to boost its memory by up to 128GB. Those two things alone may be enough to grab your attention and convince you that this is the device for you (or your loved one).</p>
<p>Plus, the stylish glass and metal body makes this phone look less like a budget offering and more like a high-end device.</p>

<p>So, where&rsquo;s the catch? Well, the phone only runs Android 5.1.1 (but you can update it) which is a bit of a let-down, and the camera isn&rsquo;t up there with the best. However, these two things points shouldn't put you off. Most users would be more than pleased with Galaxy A3 2016, especially since it's so very cheap!</p>

<h2>3) iPhone SE</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11317" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/iphone-5-se.jpg" width="600" height="374" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already got your heart set on an iPhone, the SE is by far the most affordable model on the market.</p>
<p>In this little package, you can nab yourself one of Apple&rsquo;s latest phones without having to deal with the higher price tag of the iPhone 6s or even 7. So, what does this budget Apple device have to offer?</p>
<p>Well, if you happen to be upgrading from the iPhone 5 or 5S, you should know that it&rsquo;s got a much longer battery life than its predecessor. However, not much has changed in terms of style. (In fact, if you put the 5 and the SE side by side, you&rsquo;d be hard pushed to tell the difference!) The phone does have a lightening quick processer, though, and comes in gold, rose gold, silver, and grey.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t fancy splashing out on a high-end iPhone, this neat little device is the perfect solution!</p>

<h2>2) Samsung Galaxy J5 2016</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12727" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/samsung-galaxy-j5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no doubt that the Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 scores highly on any list of the best cheap phones of the year. With a suave metal body, some cool camera features, and the TouchWiz interface, this is an excellent budget phone. Surprisingly, the battery life actually rivals Samsung&rsquo;s flagship device - the Galaxy S7. Plus, the design of the phone is just gorgeous.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a couple of downsides to the device that are worth considering. For one thing, while the AMOLED display is great (and better than that of the Moto G4), it&rsquo;s not as bright as an LCD-based display. You should also know that you won&rsquo;t be able to demand too much in terms of processing, but it can handle popular games and apps easily, like Candy Crush.</p>
<p>For the Samsung fan on a budget, the Galaxy J5 is your Galaxy S7.</p>

<h2>1) ZTE Blade V7</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12728" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/ZTE_Blade_V7_800_8.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p>Finally, the ZTE Blade V7 is incredible value for money, especially when you delve into some of the features that it has on offer. Running Android 6.0 and featuring both a 13MP rear and 8MP front camera, this device is certainly nothing short of spectacular. What&rsquo;s more, the Blade V7 includes a nifty little fingerprint sensor and a 5-inch Full HD display as per some of the more expensive phones on the market.</p>

<p>If you happen to remember the 2015 ZTE Blade S6, though, you may find the design a little underwhelming. You see, the Chinese tech company has innovated much in the design department. Still, though, for the price, this is a device that is very much worth your consideration for Christmas.</p>
