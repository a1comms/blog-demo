<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Warning: Porg Invasion is super addictive</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already rushed out to the cinema to watch <em>The Last Jedi, </em>you&rsquo;re not alone. The movie made Disney $450 million over the weekend, with thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people around the globe giving it a whirl.</p>
<p>Once the credits started rolling, though, you may have been left wanting more from the franchise&hellip;</p>
<p>Needless to say, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to wait for the next instalment of the Star Wars series to get your fill. There&rsquo;s a quicker, easier way to get more of the action from the comfort of your very own home. Facebook has just the thing.</p>
<p>The latest game to be added to the &lsquo;instant game&rsquo; line-up is <em>Star Wars: Porg Invasion</em>. You can play the game on the Facebook main site, the app, and in Messenger too.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fporginvasion%2Fposts%2F2232503636775851&amp;width=500" width="600" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s all very simple and straightforward, this is one of those addictive little games that you&rsquo;ll find yourself playing on your phone, while trying to hide it under your desk at work. (Not that we would ever condone that&hellip;)</p>
<p>The action takes place onboard the Millennium Falcon, where a flock of pesky Porgs is up to all sorts of mischief. You play by switching between two characters &ndash; BB-8 and Chewie.</p>
<p>BB-8&rsquo;s job is to deal with Porgs by aiming and grabbing them (you do this by tapping him), while Chewie needs to take care of ship maintenance (tap on the &lsquo;!&rsquo; icons as they appear). So far, so easy, right?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16012" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XeFa4yrLuG_cbQKuR0VAHe-eYsljyi_1yAZXK5FKpm8Te-hOqbNpt1XrVF2SomB0Nzc2IS-gCYk3qvxtCIV9kR2uOg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The aim of the game is to keep the Porgs under wraps and the ship working for the duration of the allotted time &ndash;&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a countdown timer in the left corner of the screen. If you can manage that, you move on to the next level. As you might imagine, each level is a little bit harder and a little bit faster than the one before it.</p>
<p>It may not sound like much, but I promise, the moment you give this one a go, you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s far more engaging than a lot of the easier games out there. What&rsquo;s more, you get extra Porg action &ndash; which is what we all really need in our lives right now!</p>
