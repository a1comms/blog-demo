<p><span class="postStandFirst">We explain what NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is, and how it works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="width: 420px; height: 283px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u0Pg2Lj-7VM/USc5CjBTrsI/AAAAAAAAA_8/sbmkPDUMli4/s720/Xperia_Tablet_Z_Xperia_Z_Group.jpg" width="720" height="486" /></p>
<p>As we enter a world without wires, one piece of tech keeps cropping up in the latest smartphones and that is NFC technology, which seems to now be a regular on handset spec sheets.</p>
<p>The question is what exactly is it and how does it work?</p>
<p>NFC technology&nbsp;is a standard function for mobile phones and similar devices to communicate with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity, this usually being no more than a few centimeters apart.</p>
<p>Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions, data exchange and simplified set-up of more complex communications such as WiFi communication. It is also possible for an NFC device to connect with an unpowered NFC chip, known as a &lsquo;tag.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Companies like Sony have been revolutionising the way we use NFC in everyday life, they incorporated the technology into their products such as the new generation of BRAVIA televisions, allowing the user to simply tap their smartphone to the television remote which then instantly mirrors the handsets display on the big screen.</p>
<p>Android has built-in file sharing using NFC. This works by simply tapping two enabled devices together and files will instantly be transmitted.</p>
<p>We will see NFC technology&nbsp;used more and more as technology in devices as it evolves.</p>
<p><strong>The future of this new and exciting tech will only get brighter as more companies embrace it and will bring their own unique ideas to the table.</strong></p>
