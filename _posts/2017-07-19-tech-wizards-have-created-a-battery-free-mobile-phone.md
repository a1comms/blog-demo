<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Could battery-free technology<em>&nbsp;</em>be the future of smartphones?</span></p>
<p>Imagine for a minute how very different the world would be if you never had to charge your phone. Each night, instead of plugging your device in, you could simply set it down and go to sleep, safe in the knowledge that it&rsquo;d be fully ready to go when you wake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a seemingly small difference but one that would doubtless change our relationship with tech. After all, there&rsquo;s nothing more annoying in this world than running out of juice when you&rsquo;re on the go, right?</p>
<p>Well, thanks to some clever tech wizards in the US, the reality of having a battery-free smartphone may be closer than you think.</p>
<p>Yes, researchers from the University of Washington have now created a prototype device that runs on <em>practically</em> <em>nothing</em>. It needs just 3.5 microwatts of power, a fraction of what a regular phone uses, to function.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all. You&rsquo;ll <em>never </em>need to plug the device in to charge it. It harvests what&rsquo;s known as ambient power (i.e. radio signals and light) as its main source of fuel. So, not only would the device be super-efficient, it&rsquo;d also be pretty darn eco-friendly, too. What could be better?</p>

<p>As you can see from the video above, the phone looks very basic. Forget snazzy finishes or full-screen displays. It&rsquo;s comprised of a circuit board and capacitive touch buttons.</p>
<p>The battery-free phone doesn't look like much right now, but still, the team got great first results. They were even able to make Skype calls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could imagine in the future that all cell towers or Wi-Fi routers could come with our base station technology embedded in it,&rdquo; Vamsi Tall, the research&rsquo;s co-author, explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if every house has a Wi-Fi router in it, you could get battery-free cell phone coverage everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, what does the future hold ? While the device is merely a prototype at this stage, it could tell us a lot about the potential of mobile phones. There may be a point when some electronic devices no longer need batteries at all.</p>
<p>How far away this tech is, though, is unknown. The mind boggles.</p>
