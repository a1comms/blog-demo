<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony has been working hard to make a name for itself in the smartphone market since ditching Ericsson and going it alone.</span></p>
<p>Sony has chosen a revamped and refreshed Xperia range to do this, with some very impressive handsets over the last 12 months. Last year we had the&nbsp;Xperia S, which surprised everyone &ndash; including, we would guess, Sony itself &ndash; with its sleek design and impressive specs.</p>
<p>The Xperia S was a great debut (if you can call it that) for a tech stalwart trying to find its way in a cut-throat, post-iPhone, post-Samsung marketplace. But what about the difficult second &lsquo;album?&rsquo; Having surprised everyone first time around and raised expectations to tricky new heights, could Sony deliver another high-quality flagship?</p>
<p>The device flying the Sony smartphone flag for 2013 is the&nbsp;Xperia Z, a phone which delivers on all its promises and could very well walk away with the &lsquo;Smartphone of the Year&rsquo; title come December. The chances are that you&rsquo;ve seen the Xperia Z on TV, in the papers and pretty much anywhere else where Sony could pay for advertising space. The tech giant was shrewd in getting the Xperia Z to market ahead of the Galaxy S4, and it&rsquo;s keen to let everyone know about it.</p>
<p>But it needn&rsquo;t worry about the competition; the Xperia Z has the looks and the specs &ndash; not to mention the water resistance, which is a genuine bonus rather than sales gimmick &ndash; to be a real contender in an overcrowded smartphone market.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Smartphone Features</strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/sony_xperia_z.jpg" width="182" height="358" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the looks; Sony has made some subtle yet important changes to the Xperia S&rsquo;s design, rounding off the corners and giving the device a sleek piano-black finish.</p>
<p>At 146g, the device isn&rsquo;t the lightest phone out there and with a five-inch screen to deal with it can feel a little awkward in the hand. But massive screens are the flavour of the moment for smartphone makers, and the Xperia&rsquo;s Full HD resolution is stunning.</p>
<p>Where Sony really delivers with the Xperia Z, and what could see the device take that &lsquo;Smartphone of the Year&rsquo; title, is with the specs &ndash; which are almost unrivalled at the moment. They talk for themselves; a quad-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon Krait processor, 2GB of RAM, 1080p display, an expandable 16GB of storage and a 13MP camera.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough &ndash; which it certainly should be &ndash; then there&rsquo;s the Android Jelly Bean OS (though only the 4.1 version at the moment) and 4G capabilities. These specs all combine to create a swift, satisfying user experience that will delight and surprise over and over again.</p>
<p>All is not perfect of course; the camera, though a decent 13MP, leaves a little to be desired, and there are some unnecessary software bugs that should&rsquo;ve been ironed out before release. But these are minor issues that won&rsquo;t get in the way of what is a fantastic device &ndash; both inside and out. You certainly pay a lot for the privilege, but Sony delivers enough to get away with it.</p>
