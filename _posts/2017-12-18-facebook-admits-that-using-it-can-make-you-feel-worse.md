<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s all about <em>how </em>you use it!</span></p>
<p>For most of us, Facebook is an integral part of our daily lives. You may interact with your friends via Messenger, arrange parties using the Events feature, and even sell things on the Market Place. The social media platform seems to cover all bases so well that many of us just can&rsquo;t imagine logging off forever. Despite how utterly normal it has become, Facebook could be doing us more harm than good&hellip;</p>
<p>Recently, Chamath Palihapitiya, an ex-Facebook executive came out to say that he feels &ldquo;tremendous guilt&rdquo; for his part in making the &ldquo;tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.&rdquo; The damning statement was made at a Stanford Business School event and later published on The Verge website.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is eroding the core foundations of how people behave.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth,&rdquo; claimed Palihapitiya as part of the talk. &ldquo;This is a global problem. It is eroding the core foundations of how people behave by and between each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While you may think that those still in the Facebook ranks would want to dispute these claims, quite the opposite has happened. On Friday, David Ginsberg, Director of Research, and Moira Burke, Research Scientist at <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook published a post</a> on the company&rsquo;s own blog admitting that the platform can make people &lsquo;feel worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10156872538281729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&ldquo;In general, when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information &mdash; reading but not interacting with people &mdash; they report feeling worse afterward,&rdquo; reads the post. &ldquo;In one experiment, University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read Facebook for 10 minutes were in a worse mood at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on Facebook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the post wasn&rsquo;t all negative &ndash; the researchers also pointed out that, when used in a certain way, Facebook can help people, rather than disrupt their mental health. The idea is that when people <em>engage </em>with the platform properly, i.e. message people and comment on posts, it can boost their well-being levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actively interacting with people &mdash; especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions &mdash; is linked to improvements in well-being,&rdquo; the post continues.</p>
<blockquote><p>...staying in touch with these friends and loved ones brings us joy...</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This ability to connect with relatives, classmates, and colleagues is what drew many of us to Facebook in the first place, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that staying in touch with these friends and loved ones brings us joy and strengthens our sense of community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, to combat any of the potentially harmful aspects of Facebook, the researchers say that the News Feed experience has been improved and that there are many new tools. For example, the Snooze feature allows users to hide posts from friends for a period of 30 days, while the Take A Break feature gives people control over their ex-partner&rsquo;s posts.</p>
<p>There are also Suicide Prevention Tools on the site, which are there to assist people in helping their friends who may be in need of support.</p>
<p>Whether these new features do indeed help or not remains to be seen, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure, we should all be more conscious of how we consume social media &ndash;&nbsp;if only, for the good of our mental health.</p>
