<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Gaming and entertainment, as we know it, will be&nbsp;changed forever.</span></p>
<p>The world of technology is so progressive and fast-paced, if you dare to take your eyes off it for just a heartbeat, you might not recognise it the moment you look back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much what happened with virtual reality (VR) for me.</p>
<p>VR, if you haven&rsquo;t heard about it, is a mind-blowing technology that immerses users in entirely simulated worlds that&rsquo;re only limited by imagination. And it seems to have come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Built-into wearable headgear, VR changes dynamically with your point of view, so as you move your head, what&rsquo;s presented in front of you adjusts accordingly. It means you can experience various scenarios first-hand, from the comfort of your living room.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the big tech companies are clambering over each other to market this up-and-coming technology. They wouldn&rsquo;t be doing their job if they didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Generally, like most tech products, there are three tiers to work with when choosing a VR device: lower, middle and upper. We&rsquo;ve picked our favourite from each tier, to help narrow down the choice should you wish to join the VR revolution.</p>
<h2>Google Cardboard - &pound;15</h2>
<p>Google is one of the earliest adopters of VR for mass market, with Google Cardboard. It&rsquo;s a simple and inexpensive VR device, perfect for dipping your toe in the water. Users must clip their phone into Google Cardboard, using apps to explore various new worlds.</p>

<p>The quality of mobile virtual reality is set to get a whole lot better this autumn, with Google working on a big update called Daydream. You won&rsquo;t just be able to experience games and videos in new ways, but sports and apps like Google Street View too.</p>
<h2>Samsung Gear VR - &pound;80</h2>
<p>Slightly more expensive, but still very affordable, is the Gear VR by Samsung. Powered by Oculus &ndash; the experts in mobile and consumer VR &ndash; this device also harnesses the capabilities&nbsp;of your mobile phone to simulate&nbsp;virtual worlds in front of your eyes. Though the packaging and experience is a little more premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11014" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/Samsung-Gear-VR.jpg" alt="Samsung Gear VR" width="600" height="333" /></p>
<p>Again, it creates an exciting platform for watching content and playing games on an entirely new level, where you genuinely feel like you&rsquo;re living and breathing in the moment. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are, you can strap the Gear VR on and lose yourself.</p>
<h2>Oculus Rift - TBC (circa &pound;450)</h2>
<p>The guys who helped Samsung create the Gear VR also went and built their own device. Called Rift, this VR headset is a complete standalone unit, engineered with its own state-of-the-art display and optics, designed specifically for VR.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11013" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/Oculus-Rift-1.jpg" alt="Oculus Rift" width="600" height="421" /></p>
<p>Sure, you can get Quad HD display smartphones that look great plugged into the Gear VR and Google Cardboard, but the Oculus Rift blows them all out the water with its purpose-built technology. That does come at a pretty hefty cost, though, so unless you&rsquo;re serious about VR, you probably won&rsquo;t be comfortable with the outlay.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s next for VR?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re expecting 2016 to be the biggest year for consumer VR yet. You&rsquo;ve got Google gearing up to launch Daydream, as we talked about above. And Sony&rsquo;s got its PlayStation VR still to come, which will combine VR headsets with controllers, giving players even more autonomy. Can you even begin to image how unreal games like Call of Duty will be?</p>
