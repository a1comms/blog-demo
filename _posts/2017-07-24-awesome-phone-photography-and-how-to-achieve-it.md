<p>Capture, edit, share. Here are some general tips and tricks on how to capture some killer photos on your smartphones. We'll cover some of our favourite phones for photography, plus some cool ways you can enhance your images further with popular apps.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_14361" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/s8-camera.png"><img class="wp-image-14361 size-full" title="via Samsung.com" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/s8-camera.png" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></a> Samsung Galaxy S8 camera[/caption]</p>
<h2>General Tips</h2>
<p>Here's some of our basic tips for capturing the best images.</p>
<p><strong>1) Use of Light</strong></p>
<p>When outdoors, avoiding the sun and picking your time of day are important, depending what type of pictures you want. Avoid shooting directly into the sun (bonus tip: try hiding the sun behind an object for a cool effect), or towards a bright light if shooting at night. Instead, position the light behind you, or to the side, to expose your subject to the most amount of light possible.</p>
<p><strong>2) Experiment and Enjoy</strong></p>
<p>Shoot lots of images to get that one money shot. &nbsp;Enjoy yourself. And get creative. Hang around a spot for a while; weather and light can change within minutes, generally, creating a new image right before your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>3) Go on, Zoom in Closer&hellip;, Is Not What You Want to Be Doing</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t zoom too much, or at all if you can help it. You get a better-quality image without the zoom. Try and work the subject if it's a bit too far away, move to another spot or try and get closer.</p>
<p><strong>4) Make of the Most of Existing Lines</strong></p>
<p>Landscapes, buildings and roads all have natural or man-made lines you can use to line up your image perfectly. Give it a go and turn on your smartphone photo grid in your phone settings to assist you lining shots up.</p>

<h2>iPhone 7</h2>
<p>So, you fancy a bit of iPhoneography? This is what you get with your iPhone 7;</p>
<ul>
<li>A 12-megapixel main and 7-megapixel front facing HD cameras</li>
<li>OIS (optical image stabilization) helping to reduce image blur by even the smallest of margins</li>
<li>Wide-angle shooting, digital zoom up to 5x and Quad-LED true tone flash</li>
<li>An f/1.8 aperture allows light into the camera during the time it takes to photograph your picture &ndash; the lower the aperture, the more light and true-to-life your images look</li>
</ul>
<p>Other built-in iPhone 7 features:</p>
<p>The Photos app comes with your iPhone. Open your image with it to crop, edit, and of course, apply a cheeky filter to your shots. No need to apply an Instagram filter with these pre-installed beauties.</p>
<p>You also get several shooting options to achieve iPhone artistry; you can shoot in HDR, capture live photos, engage LED flash, and try burst effect on a moving target ensuring you catch that perfectly timed masterpiece.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy S8</h2>

<li>Tap the screen with touch focus, engage Auto HDR, use Selective Focus to get depth of field pics</li>
<li>f/1.7 aperture on both cameras allowing in plenty of light to make your pictures look true to life - a lower aperture generally means better quality snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Other built-in Samsung Galaxy S8 features:</p>
<p>Standard filters include: stickers, stamps and photo overlays, ideal for sharing on social apps and achieving Snapchat-like results.</p>

<ul>
<li>With Huawei P10 you have a 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel main camera with an f/2.2 aperture, and an 8-megapixel front facing camera with an f/1.9 aperture &ndash; generally speaking, the lower the aperture figure the better image you'll get</li>
<li>The Huawei P10 cameras are co-developed with Leica, the German camera making experts</li>
<li>You get a Dual-tone LED flash and OIS (optical image stabilization) to help reduce blur on anything moving in shot. Also, clever 3D facial detection when using portrait mode further enhances shots</li>
<li>As a standard with premium smartphones, other shooting modes include HDR, slow motion and panorama shooting</li>
</ul>
<p>Other built-in Huawei P10 features:</p>
<p>The clever photo algorithm on the Huawei P10 is like having your own pocket studio. The focus on people and portraits makes it ideal for selfie lovers, and when applying the Bokeh effect, it makes for some special images.</p>
<p>Portrait Mode enables easy people pics that engage effects and features automatically, creating awesome shots for you.</p>
