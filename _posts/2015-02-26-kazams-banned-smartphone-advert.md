<p><span class="postStandFirst">Smartphone manufacturer KAZAM has fallen foul of the Advertising Standards Agency in the UK, where the ad for the company&rsquo;s Tornado 348 has been banned from broadcast for &ldquo;objectifying women&rdquo;. Some, however, have suggested that this ban might not be a bad thing for KAZAM&rsquo;s marketing.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been several mobile phone ads, in the past, that have found themselves in the crosshairs of the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA); the most famous is arguably an LG ad from several years ago, which allegedly &ldquo;encouraged dangerous driving&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The latest company to fall foul of the ASA is up-and-coming smartphone manufacturer, Kazam.</p>
<p>The advert in question depicted a model in her smalls, wandering around her flat and ironing her shirt, only to find that she&rsquo;d ironed her phone, the new KAZAM Tornado 348, while it was in her shirt pocket.</p>
<p>The gag being, of course, that the phone is so thin, at just 5.15mm &ndash; thinner than the likes of iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy A5 &ndash; that you don&rsquo;t even notice it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>The ASA received eight complaints. After its investigation into it, the ASA banned the advert from UK TV, saying, &ldquo;We therefore considered that the overall style of the ad served to objectify women. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence to some viewers on the basis that it objectified women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>KAZAM said the advert is simply tongue-in-cheek and that it was deliberately broadcast in a timeslot where children wouldn&rsquo;t be watching.</p>
<p>Some commentators have said that this ruling will not affect them adversely; instead, as some have pointed out, this news has now put the name KAZAM in front of a great deal more people.&nbsp;So ultimately, it could prove to be even more effective marketing than the ad alone.</p>
