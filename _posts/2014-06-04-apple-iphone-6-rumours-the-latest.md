<p><span class="postStandFirst">Just as Christmas is sure to arrive each year, the same can now be said for an iPhone launch, and a prerequisite torrent of rumours, speculation and hype. For many, there&rsquo;s little distinguishable difference between the two events.</span></p>
<p>This year is just as, if not a little bit more, exciting than the previous one. The Internet is flooding with possible variations on what the upcoming iPhone, or iPhone 6, could have in store for us. We just can't get enough of iPhone 6 rumours, can we?</p>
<p>As many of you will probably be aware, the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) is currently taking place in San Francisco, USA. The Cupertino tech giant has announced the planned launch, and features, of its latest software updates &ndash; iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.</p>
<p>But, sadly for those of us who want to hear the juicy details, nothing, worthy of note, was divulged about the iPhone 6.</p>
<p>Whilst Apple is keeping a familiarly tight lid on its upcoming iPhone, you shouldn&rsquo;t be too disheartened. Based on industry trends, speculation, leaks (some plausible, some not) and rumours, it&rsquo;s always possible to piece together an idea of what we can all expect.</p>
<p>But who knows? Maybe Apple could throw us another curveball like they did last year with the bright and beautiful&nbsp;iPhone 5c!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Below: the colourful iPhone 5c</em></p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The subject that everyone is talking about is: screen size. If you take a look at some of the most popular flagship smartphones on the market, like the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5&nbsp;and the&nbsp;HTC One M8, you&rsquo;ll notice they have larger screens than that of the&nbsp;iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>If Apple wants to compete with the top smartphones, it&rsquo;s imperative to engineer and construct a product that suits the specifications that consumers within the industry are demanding: big screens.</p>
<p>So what should we expect? Well, reports claim that the display on the iPhone 6 could range anywhere from 4.7-inches to 5.5-inches. Other reports claim that we could in fact see two iPhones launched, each featuring the above mentioned screen sizes respectively.</p>
<p>An increase in screen size should naturally result in an increase in screen resolution, which means that the iPhone 6 will deliver a much sharper picture on its Retina Display.</p>
<p>Rumours suggest Apple has been working on a 1334 x 750 (326ppi) screen for the 4.7-inch iPhone and a 1920 x 1080 (401ppi) screen for the 5.5-inch handset.</p>
<p>Just to rock the boat a little bit, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that other reports are suggesting we could see a pixel-tripled display of 1704 x 960, which means that Apple could stick with the 16:9 aspect ratio that originated on its iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Some are even claiming a screen resolution as high as 2272x1280.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more great news for the calamitous Apple fanboys out there &ndash; there&rsquo;s heaps of speculation claiming that the iPhone 6 will sport a sapphire display.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t be fooled, sapphires are more than just pretty stones; they&rsquo;re extremely durable and would withstand a lot more wear and tear than previous iPhone screens.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>With Apple releasing the &lsquo;s&rsquo; iteration last year, which of course delivered incremental aesthetic changes to its predecessor, rather than a complete makeover, we&rsquo;re likely to see something entirely different this year.</p>
<p>To set itself apart from the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 6 could be fashioned from a new, glossy aluminium shell, giving it its most premium finish to date.</p>
<p>The power button is allegedly being shifted to the side of the device, and the volume keys are also in for a redesign.</p>
<p>Another, but albeit less common, rumour that&rsquo;s doing the rounds on the web is a possible curved glass display, much like the LG G Flex and Samsung Galaxy Round.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no glaringly obvious reason why Apple would dispose of the Touch ID feature, which was integrated into the home button on the iPhone 5s. So, it&rsquo;s a fairly safe bet to assume the iPhone 6 will boast the same fingerprint reading technology.</p>
<p>Since no one has heard anything to suggest otherwise, it&rsquo;s pretty likely the iPhone 6 will feature a lightning port &ndash; much like the latest iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Below: Apple is reportedly redesigning the volume keys and relocating the power button from the top of the device, to the side</em></p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The performance on the iPhone 6 could see a significant boost, with the possible inclusion of an A8 64-bit processor.</p>
<p>The current A7 64-bit processor is by no means something to grumble about, but with a sharper, more vibrant display possibly on its way, it&rsquo;s good to have a little extra performance prowess to keep it running seamlessly.</p>
<p>This, coupled with a potential 2GB RAM, would create a pretty potent smartphone, capable of anything you dare ask of it.</p>
<p>Additionally, an internal upgrade such as the one mentioned should help improve the handset&rsquo;s battery life too, which is something we all like to hear.</p>
<p>Whilst this might be a little bit of a long shot, and more of a hopeful plea, whispers are spreading across the web, telling tales of a possible battery that&rsquo;ll feature solar charging technology. Yes please!</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Historically, the cameras on iPhones haven&rsquo;t boasted huge numbers of megapixels, and it can be easy to dismiss them when it comes to photography. That would be a mistake.</p>
<p>The 8MP iSight camera on the iPhone 5s has some great bits of software, including burst mode, slow-mo video, live video zoom, panorama photos and much more.</p>
<p>One thing it is lacking is Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). This intelligent piece of software helps reduce blur and the effects of shaky hands when taking photos and videos, ultimately giving the user crisper results.</p>
<p>So a fairly substantial camera upgrade for the iPhone 6 is likely, if Apple want to dismiss the criticism and compete with some of the other sharp shooters out there, like the&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 1020&nbsp;and the recently announced&nbsp;LG G3.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) certainly isn&rsquo;t a groundbreaking feature for the smartphone industry, but perhaps Apple may finally decide to incorporate it into its next iPhone.</p>
<p>NFC could allow the iPhone to pair up with other NFC-enabled devices, in addition to enabling users to use it like a bankcard &ndash; making payments much swifter and more convenient.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6 could also feature improved LTE components that would work in tandem with Voice Over LTE (VoLTE), which would allow users to talk on the phone and browse the Internet simultaneously.</p>
<p>Could we see Apple integrate the option to expand internal storage? Plenty of devices powered by Android and Windows Phone give users the option to increase their smartphone&rsquo;s storage through a microSD card, whilst iPhones never have.</p>
<p>This would, however, disrupt Apple&rsquo;s traditional design and pricing structure. So let&rsquo;s not jump to any conclusions just yet.</p>
<h2>Price and release</h2>
<p>In terms of the price, no one can ever pinpoint an exact figure so soon before the official announcement. But, it&rsquo;s likely that the iPhone 6 will be placed in the same initial price bracket as its counterpart &ndash; the iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>If last year&rsquo;s release is anything to go by, we can expect the iPhone 6 to be launched sometime during September. However, the rumoured 5.5-inch iPhone 6 is apparently being delayed for a late 2014 launch, or maybe early 2015.</p>
