<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The rumour mill has been churning!</span></p>
<p>In bizarre news: Could HTC stop making smartphones? Over the last few years, the company has gone from an unknown manufacturer to one of the biggest in the world. So, it would be a rather random turn of events should they decide to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumours circulating on social media about the Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer. One of the most interesting whispers is the idea that the company will stop making smartphones altogether. The tasty and worrying little rumour suggests that the mega business will stop making phones in favour of focusing on Vive virtual reality (VR) headsets from now on.</p>
<p><em>Surely not! </em></p>
<p>It would be quite the shift. However, according to online publication <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20181122PD202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digitimes</a>, the company has denied these claims.</p>
<p>Executives from the brand claim that the business is still bolstering its smartphone lineup and will be releasing some brand new devices towards the end of 2018 and the start of 2019. What&rsquo;s more, they say that they will be adding to this offering as well as releasing a whole load of new VR tech. Interesting.</p>
<p>So, what does the future hold for HTC smartphones? Well, the company also says that it will be working on a special 5G smartphone and that future devices may integrate extra technology such as&nbsp;AI capabilities and blockchain too. All of the above means that the company likely has massive plans in the years to come&hellip; and no plans to stop.</p>

<p>The brand&rsquo;s latest handset release was the HTC U12+, which came out earlier this year. While there have also been rumours that there will never be a&nbsp;U13 model, the company may choose to go in another direction. In fact, many believe that the manufacturer will be bringing out a new version of the HTC U12 later this year, complete with more ROM and RAM.</p>
<p>Of course, since none of us have a crystal ball or spies within the HTC upper ranks, we will likely have to wait a while to hear the full story. Right now, thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t look as though the company are ready to give up and stop making smartphones altogether. But who knows what the future may hold? Stranger things have happened.</p>
