<p><span class="postStandFirst">With festival season just around the corner and summer (hopefully) on its way, it's nearly time for those feel-good anthems to reach our ears, so get your smartphone well and truly ready!</span></p>
<p>Smartphones have becoming our go-to gadget. We use them for everything from our camera to our personal assistant and, for some time now, we have had the ability to play music from our handsets. Originally this was in the form of MP3 files but, as data speeds have improved, we can now utilise our mobiles as digital radios and streaming devices.</p>
<p>Here, we take a look at a couple of the best music services which act as a great accompaniment to your favourite gig or when you have friends over for a BBQ.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular streaming services currently available, Spotify offers the user a library of more than 20 million tracks which can be streamed directly to a PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone. Users can create and share their own playlists from Spotify's integrated radio service. The services available differ depending on the user's requirements and can be either unlimited or premium which are charged at different monthly rates.</p>
<p><strong>Download Spotify here for&nbsp;Android,&nbsp;<a href="http://:%20https//itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spotify/id324684580?mt=8">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://:%20http//www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/spotify/10f2995d-1f82-4203-b7fa-46ddbd07a6e6">Windows Phone 8</a>&nbsp;devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deezer</strong></p>
<p>Another extremely popular streaming service is Deezer, a great alternative to Spotify. With Deezer you have the ability to stream 20 million tracks to portable devices and even Smart TVs. One of the great features of this service is the artist-themed radio channels which offer great mixes from your favourite artists. Deezer also offers the option to listen to your music offline so users can download favourite playlists to their device and enjoy, even when you have no mobile signal. There are subscription plans to suit all needs, making this a great option for music fans.</p>
<p><strong>Download Deezer here for&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deezer.android.app&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImRlZXplci5hbmRyb2lkLmFwcCJd">Android</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/deezer/id292738169?mt=8">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://:%20http//www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/deezer/abf78126-7301-e011-9264-00237de2db9e">Windows Phone 8</a>&nbsp;devices.</strong></p>
<p>There are many other streaming sites out there but none as versatile as the above. However there is a rumour that Google is planning its own music service, so watch this space!</p>
