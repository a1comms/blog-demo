<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Surprise! It&rsquo;s another Chinese mega-brand.</span></p>
<p>Never heard of Xiaomi? You might not be alone. The Chinese firm has never once entered the UK market. Until now.</p>
<p>Yes, the best brand you haven't heard of until today, is set to launch a whole range of affordable phones and other tech. What&rsquo;s more, as the fourth best-selling handset maker in the world, you can expect a fantastic offering.</p>
<p>But, how do you pronounce its name? Here's the best way you can show off down the pub, simply say, "Sh-ow-me". Got it yet? No? Try the video below.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about three Xiaomi phones that will be available in the UK soon!</p>
<h2>Xiaomi Mi A2</h2>
<p>Coated in matte aluminium and packing a 5.99-inch display with a 2160 x 1080 resolution LCD screen, the &nbsp;Xiaomi Mi A2 is an attractive phone. The design is minimal and sleek.</p>
<p>When it comes to the camera, Xiaomi has stepped up its game. There&rsquo;s a dual camera setup on the rear, which is impressive with 12-megapixel and 20-megapixel sensors. The selfie cam also comes in strong at 20-megapixels too.</p>
<p>Running a version of Android Oreo and with 4GB RAM, you can expect a good level of performance. The device is not the most advanced on the market, but it comes in at a budget price point and gives the user more than what they need. This affordable phone is just what you need if you want a low-hassle smartphone.</p>

<h2>Xiaomi Mi 8</h2>
<p>With a cool glass coat, aluminium alloy frame and a massive screen-to-phone ratio, there&rsquo;s a whole lot to love about the Xiaomi Mi 8. This device offers more than you might expect from a seemingly budget phone option. For instance, the device actually has a fingerprint sensor built into the display. Considering that this device costs a great deal less than most flagships, it could be something of a threat.</p>
<p>The screen is a 6.21-inch AMOLED offering with Full-HD+ resolution. It should be enough to impress most phone users. Plus, you also get a massive Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB RAM, which is more than some of the latest flagships. All in all, it&rsquo;s a pretty decent offering, if you&rsquo;re looking for a high-end budget device.</p>

<h2>Xiaomi Pocophone F1</h2>
<p>Dubbed the &lsquo;Master of Speed&rsquo; (by Xiaomi themselves!), the Pocophone F1 is a fantastic mid-range offering. Should you choose this phone, you get some of the very latest features in the world of smartphones. For example, there&rsquo;s the IR face unlock, which you might think you&rsquo;d only find one the highest range of phones out there. You can get the device with either 6GB RAM and, according to the reviews, it is super quick!</p>
<p>The display is nothing to sniff at either with a whopping 6.18-inch Full HD+ screen and a 2246 x 1080 resolution. It&rsquo;s actually surprisingly high-end and attractive. Pair that with a sleek and minimal design and a host of other great features and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a recipe for success. This could be the ideal mid-range phone for&hellip; Well, everybody!</p>
