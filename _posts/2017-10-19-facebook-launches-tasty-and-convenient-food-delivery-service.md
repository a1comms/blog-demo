<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Facebook goes for a slice of the takeaway pie with a brand new food ordering feature.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You&rsquo;re idly looking at your news feed on a Sunday evening, scrolling through the endless baby pictures and cat videos, when you see something that catches your eye. Your Facebook friend has checked into a tasty-looking restaurant, and you want a slice of the action...</p>
<p>The problem is, Sunday evenings are for sitting around in your pants, while surfing social media. Not getting dressed and going out. But what if you didn&rsquo;t have to leave the house? Or Facebook, for that matter&hellip;</p>
<p>Just this week, Facebook rolled out a new &lsquo;Order Food&rsquo; feature, allowing users to... wait for it... order food right from the app. With just the tap of a button!&nbsp;The social media site has been busy teaming up with delivery services to launch this feature, which is already available on many restaurant&rsquo;s Pages.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10156593943136729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=278" width="278" height="476" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10156593940706729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=278" width="278" height="476" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: You simply head to the page of your favourite foodie place, click the Start Order button at the top, then choose what you want, and pay. Simples!</p>
<p>There are different delivery services selected for different restaurants and different regions. Then, a driver (or cyclist, potentially) will bring your food to your home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People already go to Facebook to browse restaurants and decide where to eat or where to order food, so we&rsquo;re making that easier,&rdquo; said Alex Himmel, Facebook&rsquo;s VP of Local.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re combining options from a number of restaurants and food ordering services, so you don&rsquo;t have to search through multiple places and eat what you want, in just a few taps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wait, we have some bad news. Sadly, Facebook's new food ordering feature is only available in the US right now, and there&rsquo;s no word yet on when/if it&rsquo;s coming to the UK.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15314" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6qxb7CIWRfVqNbdBocS7X39Mrn6Ve_wAd-OWuOjqdxUU4raughbK-iIG7wfIYVneAe4Omaxg3ZI5VtKL7uewteua=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>However, given that many major Facebook features launch in the US before they are rolled out around the globe, the chances here are pretty good. What&rsquo;s more, it could make choosing where to order from a whole lot easier. Modern life is truly excellent.</p>
