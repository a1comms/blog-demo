<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Let the battle between Samsung&rsquo;s best commence!</span></p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve finally had a peek at the Samsung Galaxy S9, it&rsquo;s time to see how far this device has come. Its predecessor, the Galaxy S8, has been a wildly popular device since its launch. So, the question is, has Samsung improved on it? Let&rsquo;s look and see. It's Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-lilac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S9</a>!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>When Samsung Galaxy S8 was first announced, many fawned over its beauty. It was unveiled to us complete with an almost bezeless screen, with a coating so slick and shiny you just wanted to rub your face down it.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>The colours were attractive too, available in Orchid Gray, Coral Blue and Rose Pink. The whole device just felt like a natural progression in the Samsung line, and was at once modern and desirable. Some may have been forgiven for thinking that it couldn&rsquo;t get any better.</p>

<p>And then, the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-the-two-best-mobiles-money-can-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S9 was announced</a>. This device takes it up a level and, dare we say it, looks even better than the Galaxy S8. The bezels at the top and bottom of the device have been taken down a notch, allowing for a more streamlined look. It&rsquo;s available in the likes of <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midnight Black</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coral Blue</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-lilac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilac Purple</a>. Oh, and there&rsquo;s the fact that the fingerprint scanner has moved down, below the camera sensor, making it easier to use!</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Samsung fans will know one thing for sure: these two Galaxies are all about the screen. No, seriously, they are. Samsung Galaxy S8 has a truly impressive offering here, with a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED screen and a Quad HD (2960 x 1440) resolution. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the default setting means the screen runs at Full HD. For a Quad HD resolution, you&rsquo;ll need to change the display settings.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S9 boasts the same screen size at 5.8 inches and Quad HD resolution. So, nothing has changed there, but did it need to? A neat little addition, though, is a minor change to Landscape Mode. When you turn the device, the &lsquo;app tray&rsquo; moves with it. That should make apps more accessible while you&rsquo;re doing other things.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 comes packed with the company&rsquo;s very own Exynos 8895 processor, for a speedy, powerful performance that still holds its own one year later. The addition of 4GB RAM certainly helps, and a generous 64GB storage space is plenty for most. Anyone wanting to increase their Galaxy S8 storage can do so, using a microSD card up to 256GB.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16804" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/olHesn01gXkemKnKm8bpXT8jmLlwKOuGj8-ovXVD0phqowwUsUNCKu3Q8tHvIK2PaYHOOS9mEVLGaXih7ZPZUHC9sA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As for the Galaxy S9, it boasts the new and upgraded Exynos 9810 processor for even more powerful and efficient performance. It also houses 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, as well as a microSD card slot that supports an increased 400GB.</p>
<p>Both Galaxy smartphones run on Android, of course, though the Galaxy S9 is powered by the newer Android 8.0 Oreo. Whereas Samsung Galaxy S8 is still running Android 7.0 Nougat (at the time of writing). It&rsquo;s likely that the Galaxy S8 will get the latest Android update before too long, though.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 kills it when it comes to the selfie cam. The front-facing shooter is a quality 8MP unit with a Wide Selfie mode to squeeze more into every shot. Samsung understands the importance of the front-facing camera in the modern, selfie-crazed age, and did it justice on the Galaxy S8. A</p>
<p>round the back, there&rsquo;s a dual pixel 12MP camera with an f/1.7 aperture lens, complete with optical image stabilisation and video shooting in 4K. Never one to lose pace, Samsung has outdone the Galaxy S8 with its latest smartphone. Samsung Galaxy S9 features some serious upgrades here. The rear camera boasts a Dual Aperture that takes excellent photos in both dark and bright conditions.</p>

<p>Galaxy S9 also features a next level video camera, capable of recording Super Slow-mo footage at a ridiculous 960 frames per second. With Motion Detection turned on, your camera automatically starts filming when you need it to. And you can even save your slow-mo masterpiece to your lock screen.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 introduced Bixby, Samsung&rsquo;s very own AI. It&rsquo;s good, but perhaps a little flawed. The fact that it lacks some connectivity means that users don&rsquo;t get the full experience here. Additional features include a fingerprint scanner, iris scanner, and a heart rate monitor too.</p>
<p>On the Galaxy S9, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that Bixby has had a few upgrades. For instance, it now boasts a feature that tells you how many calories you&rsquo;re about to eat, just by taking a picture of your meal. There&rsquo;s also the AR emoji feature and Facial Recognition too. Needless to say, there&rsquo;s a whole lot to love here.</p>

<h2>Conclusion. Drum Roll, Please...</h2>
<p>So, which Samsung Galaxy is best? Well, it&rsquo;s plain to see that Samsung Galaxy S9 has beaten the Galaxy S8 in every area&hellip; and so it should. Samsung has done a fantastic job of upgrading the device and improving it at every turn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that the Galaxy S8 isn't still a great phone. Put it up against many other flagships, and it can more than hold its own.</p>
<p>Which you ultimately choose depends on your budget and what you need. Either way, you really won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
