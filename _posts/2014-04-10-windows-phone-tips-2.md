<p><span class="postStandFirst">If you&rsquo;ve just bought yourself a new Windows phone, or you're thinking about it, then we&rsquo;re here with the top 5 Windows phone tips, from setting up the Live Tiles on your Start screen to controlling your Xbox with the SmartGlass and beyond!</span></p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve grabbed yourself a shiny new phone running on Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Phone platform, and now that you&rsquo;ve got it out of the box, it&rsquo;s time to see what amazing feats this powerhouse operating systems can do.</p>
<p>Maybe you bought a Nokia Lumia 1020, with the most amazing smartphone camera in Christendom. Maybe you grabbed a Nokia Lumia 520 or even a Nokia Lumia 625, the Windows-powered phone that offers top-flight thrills at a bargain bucket price.</p>
<p>Or, on the other other hand, maybe you eschewed Nokia altogether, and went for the fantastically funky HTC 8S. Whichever phones you grabbed, however, there are a few things that you&rsquo;re going to love trying out!</p>
<h2>1) Link up your accounts on the phone</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/13757399614_23b734f44a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="426" /></p>
<p>Adding your Facebook and Windows accounts to the phone takes mere moments, and it&rsquo;s definitely a worthwhile thing to do; in fact, it&rsquo;s probably the very first thing you should do with your new Windows phone, as the integration of these disparate social tools is second-to-none! Being able to access your friends&rsquo; Facebook alerts directly through the People Hub is a <em>huge</em> time-saver, and if you&rsquo;re the kind of person who likes to keep abreast of what your friends are up to, it&rsquo;s so nice to have all of those alerts in one easy to find place.</p>
<h2>2) Play about with the Live Tiles on the Start screen</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/13757034863_ef90269b0d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="284" /></p>
<p>Where Android has widgets, Windows Phone has Live Tiles. In <em>principle</em>, they&rsquo;re not massively different from each other; both serve as a way to quickly access information and features from the phone&rsquo;s home screen.</p>
<p>However, Windows Phone differs from Android in that it takes a more regimented, and ultimately simpler, approach (and simplicity is <em>not</em> a bad thing). Instead of widgets going wherever you like, the Windows Phone Start screen is laid out in a grid formation, and Live Tiles can be resized to fit this grid, giving you a nice way to customise your phone, with a unified look that can sometimes be missing from <em>some</em> Android phones&rsquo; home screens (depending on how people set them up, naturally).</p>
<h2>3) Try out Xbox SmartGlass</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5173/13757021785_9d6147ed7a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="275" /></p>
<p>Do you have an Xbox? Then you&rsquo;re about to get access to something <em>really</em> cool; put simply, with the Xbox SmartGlass app, you can actually control your console <em>with your new Windows phone</em>. Find inside info and guides for whatever game you&rsquo;re playing, or even use it to scroll through the UI; SmartGlass turns your phone into a remote control for your Xbox!</p>
<h2>4) Try out Kids Corner</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/13757020685_097cec158b_z.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="391" /></p>
<p>Do you have kids? Do you want to let them play with your new phone without them: 1/ seeing something they shouldn&rsquo;t; and 2/ changing the language to Swedish and password-protecting every single thing on the phone (by accident, they <em>swear</em>, but you&rsquo;re not too sure about that)?</p>
<p>Activate Kids Corner, lock down the phone to only the apps and access <em>you</em> decide, and they can play with your phone in complete safety!</p>
<h2>5) Check out the brilliant VoIP integration</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/13757035713_718717ddaf.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="270" /></p>
<p>Windows Phone has brilliant VoIP (Voice-over-IP) integration, for one simple reason: Microsoft owns Skype. Thus, what you have in your hands is not just a phone, it&rsquo;s also a fantastic &ldquo;Skype box&rdquo;!</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there&rsquo;s loads more you can do with your new Windows phone, try out these 5 top tips, and you&rsquo;ll start to see just how powerful your new smartphone is! </strong></p>
