<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">With the power of not one, but two rear cameras, Huawei P9 is destined for photographers.</span></p>
<p>Huawei has launched its prized flagship for 2016, complete with a pair of Leica-certified rear cameras. Yes, you read that right, &lsquo;a pair&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Named Huawei P9, this 5.2-inch device accommodates both an orthodox 12-megapixel camera and a monochrome 12-megapixel camera, positioned adjacent to each other. Like two little watchful eyes.</p>
<p>Used together, they can perform miracles, improving photo contrast by 50% and tripling the level of light absorbed into each shot. The explanation is down to the bonus monochrome sensor, which doesn&rsquo;t feature RGB light filtering, thus allowing it to drink up more light.</p>

<p>The triumphs don&rsquo;t stop there; Huawei P9 will arrive gift wrapped in an elegant aluminium body that&rsquo;s impressively trim (6.9mm) yet robust. It houses Huawei&rsquo;s own octa-core 955 processor and 3GB RAM for fluid usability, a 3000mAh battery for lengthy user time and a generous 32GB storage space (complete with a microSD card slot).</p>
<p>Like the Microsoft Lumia 950, the Huawei P9 supports USB Type-C charging, offering the benefit of speedy refueling times and reversible cable input. No more fumbling in the dark.</p>
<p>Launched in conjunction was the super-size variant, Huawei P9 Plus. It boasts even more RAM at 4GB and an expanded battery size at 3400mAh. Although the display is larger, it sports the same 1080p resolution as the smaller Huawei P9.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll confirm launch dates for both in due course, but we can tell you that Huawei P9 is <em>expected</em> to land on our sandy shores in April, whilst its bigger brother is due to follow next month in May. <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases">Sign up to our mailing list</a> for more availability updates and pricing.</p>
