<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Yes, an iPhone X scarf really does exists.</span></p>
<p>The festive season is creeping ever closer, which means you&rsquo;d better hurry up with your Christmas shopping. You&rsquo;ve probably sorted out a few presents by now: a woolly hat for your Uncle Steve; a pair of cosy socks for your Aunt Barbara. And so on.</p>
<p>But wait, what about that ultra tech-savvy Apple fan in your life? Well, we have just the thing.</p>
<p>Say hello to the iPhone X scarf. Yes, this is a product that really does exist, and, frankly, looks pretty awesome. The winter-warming piece of attire has been created in the image of the Apple&rsquo;s latest iPhone, which is why every self-respecting fanboy out there will want it wrapped around their neck this season.</p>

<p>The snazzy little scarf was designed by <a href="http://www.ceyhunguney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ceyhun G&uuml;ney</a>, an artist based over in Hamburg, Germany. According to his own website, he has previously worked with big brands including Adidas, Red Bull, Absolut, and Mercedes Benz. Still, there&rsquo;s nothing online to suggest that the iPhone X scarf has any type of endorsement from Apple.</p>

<p>But, let&rsquo;s not worry about that for a moment, as we take a look at the scarf itself. Complete with the globally recognised Apple logo adorning one side, and an elongated iPhone screen on the other, there&rsquo;s just so much to love here. The screen design is even on point, complete with a notch at one end. Nice.</p>

<p>The default iPhone X background &ndash; you know, the one that you&rsquo;ve seen plastered across billboards and adverts &ndash; makes up the majority of the scarf. The fun, multicoloured pattern will certainly turn heads in the street, which is perhaps part of the reason that this iPhone X scarf has been so popular already. (Seriously, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;sold out&rsquo;, and is currently &lsquo;restocking&rsquo; in time for the festive season!)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the iPhone X scarf is cheaper than an actual iPhone X. Shocking, we know. <a href="https://the-internetshop.com/products/scarf-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At just &euro;35</a> (around &pound;30, thanks to the current terrible exchange rate), it&rsquo;s an absolute bargain, perfect for showing off your love for Apple while on a budget.</p>
