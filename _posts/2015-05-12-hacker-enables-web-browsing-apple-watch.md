<p><span class="postStandFirst">An enterprising developer has hacked an Apple Watch, using it to browse the web. As you can imagine, the experience was all too underwhelming on its 1.5-inch screen.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6725 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Capture.png" alt="Web browsing - Apple Watch" width="327" height="581" /></p>
<p>When smartwatches first hit the market, it&rsquo;s fair to say that a lot of people had ideas about what particular functions they&rsquo;d be optimised for. It turns out that web browsing is certainly <em>not</em> one of those.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/10/developer-hacks-watch-os-to-get-a-web-browser-running-on-apple-watch/">9to5Mac</a>, a developer by the name of Comex managed to hack an Apple Watch, allowing him to browse the web; showing off the results by rendering Google&rsquo;s homepage on the display.</p>
<p>Naturally the constrained dimensions of the watch meant Google&rsquo;s homepage could only partially render, highlighting precisely why the Cupertino giant opted to omit the Safari web browsing app in the first place.</p>
<p>The conclusion, then, seems to be, web browsing on devices like iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus: good. Web browsing on Apple Watch: bad.</p>
<p>But what this experiment does reveal is that it&rsquo;s possible to run third party code on Apple Watch, because the underlying OS, <em>below</em> the Carousel interface (the company&rsquo;s watch interface, as opposed to the Springboard interface on the iPhone and iPad), is iOS.</p>
<p><strong>Whether that will mean jailbroken Apple Watches in the future, or simply that we&rsquo;ll see more official apps running on the device, that&rsquo;s a very encouraging thing to know! </strong></p>
