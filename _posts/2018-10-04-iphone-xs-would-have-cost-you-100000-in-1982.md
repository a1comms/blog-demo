<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Back to the Future with iPhone Xs.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re after a brand new flagship device &ndash; a la the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a> or <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> &ndash; there&rsquo;s one thing you know for sure. You certainly get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, when you really consider how much you&rsquo;re getting for your cash, it&rsquo;s plain to see that the devices are well worth it. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the facts.</p>
<h2>Supercomputers That Fit in Your Pocket</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s easy to forget the sheer amount of technology that is packed into the a teeny-tiny smartphone. Make no mistakes, these devices are no longer mere phones. Calling them that is almost laughable.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of the black and white-screen mobile phone on which we played Snake. No, the latest flagships have a range of cool innovative technology inside them.</p>
<p>You could even say that they are mini supercomputers that you can keep in your pocket. Here&rsquo;s a rundown of just some of the features they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro-level camera</li>
<li>Sat-Nav</li>
<li>Music player</li>
<li>4K camcorder</li>
<li>Games console</li>
<li>Television</li>
<li>High-tech security</li>
<li>Futuristic design</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of the above in mind, it&rsquo;s easy to see that &ndash; when you invest in an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a> or any other latest flagship &ndash; you&rsquo;re getting a whole load more than a phone.</p>
<p>Each of these items was once considered a premium-level gadget. However, these days, we take for granted the idea that our phone can do it all and more.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19070" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0pnjCQGPmT0z-buwpx0YVknPHjL8VLB-k2C6jx-NKp8nBPEVOYUc2ADbUKr6p4hFyzRCTjwwBk9QqP-3Hn3Ag-c=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Let&rsquo;s Talk Money!</h2>
<p>Ready for that tricky conversation? If you add up all the gadgets that the devices encompass, each would set you back a little.</p>
<p>Travel back in time to the 1980s, for example, and a personal GPS (Sat-Nav) did not even exist. However, some of the other gadgets that the modern smartphone boasts would have cost a fortune.</p>
<p>For instance, back in 1982 the Mattel Intellivision video computer system would have set you back &pound;149.95, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/19/price-christmas-past-boots-catalogue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. That might not sound like a lot, but when you add in inflation, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of around &pound;466. On the other hand, a Speak and Spell gadget cost a massive &pound;33.95; that&rsquo;s &pound;106 in modern terms. These are just a couple of examples of how much gadgets cost in years gone by.</p>
<p>For instance, based on the prices of tech from 1982, these latest iPhone models could be costing us more in the region of &pound;100,000! Thankfully though, due to the availability of technology, prices have come down a wee bit.</p>
<p>Since, these days, you no longer have to buy all of these individual gadgets, it makes sense that a smartphone would be a little more costly. Paying &pound;999 for a flagship device may seem like a leap for some of us. However, when you consider the fact that you get some of the best tech of our time in the deal, it&rsquo;s a real steal!</p>
