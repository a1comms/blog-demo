<p><span class="postStandFirst">In an unexpected move, amp-maker Marshall has crafted its own smartphone. Called the Marshall London, and coming complete with all the features needed to turn it into a portable recording studio, this may be the ultimate phone for both audiophiles, jobbing musicians and bearded hipsters...</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7433 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/london_0042_display_lev-700x525.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/london_0042_display_lev-700x525.jpg alt=&rdquo;Marshall London the ultimate music mobile&rdquo;/>" width="700" height="525" /></p>
<p>When a new smartphone is announced, we expect to see it branded by a well-known manufacturer, like <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank">Sony</a> or <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a>.</p>
<p>So when we heard a company better known for making guitar amps has announced&nbsp;one, our ears pricked up.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/16/8976519/marshall-london-android-smartphone">The Verge</a>, that phone is the Marshall London, and it might just be <em>the </em>most rock and roll smartphone ever made!</p>
<p>In terms of specs, the Marshall London is resolutely a mid-ranger, with a 4.7-inch 720p screen, a 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor (although it does have 2GB of RAM) and an 8MP camera.</p>
<p>It also has a 2500mAh battery and 16GB of storage (plus a microSD slot), but to talk about its raw components sort of misses the point of the phone.</p>
<p>This is not a device for top-end spec-lovers. No, Marshall has positioned this as a smartphone for <em>audiophiles</em>. And so, it has dedicated sound processor, the Wolfson WM8281 Audio Hub.</p>
<p>It has a multi-channel graphic equalizer. It has a set of Marshall Mod in-ear headphones in the box. It has a set of really loud stereo speakers,&nbsp;a dedicated music button (the M-Button), a&nbsp;proper volume wheel instead of a rocker on the side, and <em>two</em> headphone sockets, for listening to music with a friend.</p>

<p>And yet, there&rsquo;s even more, for music creators: not only does it include a DJ app, but it also includes stereo mics and the Loopstack 4-track recording app.</p>
<p>Yes, basically, the Marshall London is also a portable music studio!</p>
<p><strong>The Marshall London is due to land in Sweden during August. However, there&rsquo;s no word on whether it will wend its way to the UK, so watch this space. </strong></p>
