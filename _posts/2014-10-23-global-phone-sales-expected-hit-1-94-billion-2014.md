<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">Mobile phone sales have grown by 6% year-on-year, according to analysts, and are expected to reach 1.94 billion sales by the end of the year. The big driver for this increase, however, is <i>not</i> what you might be expecting (and no, it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> the iPhone 6)...</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5877" alt="pay-monthly" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/pay-monthly.png" width="540" height="410" />It&rsquo;s long been said that mobile phones will eventually come to rule the world, and thanks to new information provided by analysts CCS Insight, we have another hint about how close they are to reaching that goal.</p>
<p>As reported on by Mobile News, global mobile phone sales are expected to rise by 6% compared to last year, with 1.94 billion phones expected to be sold by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Six percent may seem like a small amount of growth, but with such big overall numbers involved, that small percentage is equivalent to around an extra <i>110 million</i> phones sold this year, as compared to 2013. The lion&rsquo;s share of this huge overall sales figure is made up of smartphones, with that particular &lsquo;genre&rsquo; of mobile phone accounting for 67% of total sales, with around 1.3 billion smartphones sold.</p>
<p>While top-end devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or the new iPhone 6 have seen huge sales, analysts have stated that the <i>real </i>driver for this growth in sales is the fact that smartphones are dropping in price (as we&rsquo;ve seen with the likes of the incredible Moto G 4G). This has led to a greater penetration of smartphones into developing and emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>It must also be noted that with this greater push into emerging markets, the price of smartphones is being driven downwards, and while this will pose a challenge for big name manufacturers like Samsung and Apple, the continuing drop in prices seems like a very good thing for consumers.</strong><b> </b></p>
