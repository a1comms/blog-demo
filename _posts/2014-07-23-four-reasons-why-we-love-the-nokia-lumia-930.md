<p><span class="postStandFirst">After being released in America as the Lumia Icon, the Nokia Lumia 930 has finally come to these shores. We take a look at what makes this Windows-powered phone so enticing, including its iconic look, its raw power, the sleekness of Windows Phone 8.1, and a truly gob-smacking camera.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>A while back, a new Windows-powered phone was released to great reviews in the USA; that phone was the Nokia Lumia Icon, and now, it&rsquo;s made its way over to British shores, in the gorgeous shape of the Nokia Lumia 930.</p>
<p>This has been a cause for much celebrating, but what is it about the phone that has so many people excited? Surely it&rsquo;s just a new iteration of the Nokia Lumia 920, right?</p>
<p>Well, yes. Technically, one could call it a new iteration of that phone, if one were so inclined, but the fact is that there&rsquo;s a lot more to the Nokia Lumia 930 than just that. It&rsquo;s sort of like saying that the tiger is just another iteration of the ocelot; it&rsquo;s <i>technically</i> accurate, sure, but it in no way gives you the full picture of why the bigger version is such a magnificent beast.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a look at four reasons why the Nokia Lumia 930 is, quite frankly, <i>phenomenal</i>...</p>
<h2>1) Its Delightful Design</h2>
<p>Nokia has always taken great pride in how gorgeous its range of Lumia smartphones looks, and the Nokia Lumia 930 is undoubtedly one of the most stunning phones the company has ever produced.</p>
<p>You get the same beautiful finish, with the back and front fascias tapering away to the sides, but this time a metallic bezel encircles the whole phone, and the end result is just mouth-watering. 2014 has been a really good year for smartphones with supermodel looks (the HHTC One M8 springs immediately to mind), and the Nokia Lumia 930 continues that trend.</p>
<p>On top of that, the screen size has been upped to 5-inches, while the screen resolution has been upped to 1080p, putting this <i>firmly</i> in superphone territory.</p>
<p>And speaking of superphones...</p>

<h2>2) Its Potent Power</h2>
<p>One of the best things about the current crop of Android superphones is just how ridiculously powerful they are. The Nokia Lumia 930 uses a Quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor (and has 2GB of RAM), so it&rsquo;s all set to trade blows with any Android phone you&rsquo;d care to pitch it against, from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the mighty LG G3, and beyond.</p>
<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s really, really quick, but the speed and smoothness of the interface isn&rsquo;t just down to how powerful the processor is. No, it&rsquo;s also down to how sleek the Windows Phone operating system is...</p>

<h2>3) Its Wonderful Windows Phone 8.1 OS</h2>
<p>Windows Phone 8 was kind of, just... well it was okay. It still felt a bit staid compared to the sheer headline-hogging brilliance of Android and iOS, but it did the job, and it was sleek as anything.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8.1, meanwhile, is the first version of the platform where pretty much everyone agreed that Microsoft has nailed it. Everything has been significantly improved, from the wider range of Live Tile sizes to use on the Start screen, to the upcoming inclusion of Cortana (Microsoft&rsquo;s virtual assistant), and its presence here elevates the Nokia Lumia 930 to new heights.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;4) Its Cracking Camera</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one final area where the Nokia Lumia 930 really shines, and it&rsquo;s something Nokia has <i>always</i> been good at (and will hopefully <i>stay </i>good at, now Microsoft owns the manufacturing side of the business): the camera. In the Nokia Lumia 930, you get a 20MP camera, but that huge pixel count is only the start of the story. There&rsquo;s also Carl Zeiss lenses (among the best in the business), optical image stabilisation and, best of all, PureView technology similar to that found in the Nokia Lumia 1020.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re saying, basically, is that the Nokia Lumia 930 has one of the <i>best</i> cameras you&rsquo;ll currently find on a smartphone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4684 aligncenter" alt="Nokia Lumia 930" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-23-at-11.52.43.png" width="570" height="569" /></p>

<p><strong>To conclude, the Nokia Lumia 930 just has so much going for it. It&rsquo;s gorgeous to look at, intuitive to use, incredibly powerful, and its camera is awesome. What you&rsquo;re looking at here, we reckon, is quite possibly the best Windows phone ever made! Check out our in-depth review of the Nokia Lumia 930 below.</strong></p>
