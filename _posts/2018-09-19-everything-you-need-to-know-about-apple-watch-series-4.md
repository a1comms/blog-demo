<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Could this device be your personal fitness coach?</span></p>
<p>Last week, Apple made some major announcements.</p>
<p>With all the excitement of the latest iPhone series (hello, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a>), you might have overlooked a seriously cool wearable gadget.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iol8n3m88SA" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, say hello to the Apple Watch Series 4. The new watch has most definitely been created with health and fitness in mind. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>All-New Design</h2>
<p>When rumours of the Series 4 started flitting about, there was one that we just could not shake.</p>
<p>The redesign.</p>
<p>Well, it happened. The latest Apple Watch has had something of a makeover, and it looks fantastic. With a more rounded, curved edge look and a screen that fills almost the entire face, it&rsquo;s a winning aesthetic.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXs8G7Kjrd8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Oh, and it&rsquo;s bigger too. You can now get the Apple Watch Series 4 in either 40mm or 44mm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good news when it comes to the display &ndash; it&rsquo;s a whopping 30% larger! It&rsquo;s something that most people will notice from the minute that you start using the watch.</p>
<p>The new tech that the display uses is called LTPO and should make the screen look clearer than ever. The face of the watch has been redesigned somewhat, too, boasting more detailed information on the main screen than ever before.</p>
<h2>What to Love</h2>
<p>Along with a new design, the latest version of the Apple Watch also has a wide range of features. You&rsquo;ll notice that Apple has truly focused on health and exercise with its latest additions. With that in mind, here are some of the snazzy new features.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EiI5_-7liQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h5>Activity Competitions</h5>
<p>Feeling a little competitive? Apple Watch Series 4 has a feature called &lsquo;Activity competitions.&rsquo; That means that you can challenge another Apple Watch user to a seven-day long contest. Whoever gets the most active in that time wins. (And, yes, you get digital trophies when you win too!)</p>
<h5>Workout Detection</h5>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have to tell your watch when you&rsquo;re working out&hellip; and with the Apple Watch Series 4 you don&rsquo;t have to. The device detects when you first start working out and launches the Workout app. The app immediately begins to track you and your progress.</p>
<h5>Gym Compatible</h5>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a total gym bunny, you&rsquo;ll love this next feature. Apple Watch Series 4 can pair with certain gym equipment to give you a super smart workout. It also tracks metrics such as your heart rate and speed on various pieces of gear. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h5>Heart Monitor</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18701" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kt9cfVKnA2zaPoBS3UU6Rg0qbyPVRuAvRzexNZSfCIjLWRDzSt7YubDJJZuNlNimITHDPPwKSA3C7HebeaXMlGBA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Keeping your heart healthy should be a top priority. Luckily, Apple Watch can help. The Series 4 wearable regularly monitors your heart rate throughout the day and tells you if something is amiss. That means that you can get medical attention ASAP.</p>
<h5>Breathe App</h5>
<p>Of course, we all need to reduce our stress levels. The Breathe app could help you do just that. With the Series 4 device, you can use the app as a watch face with beautiful graphics. Use it to take a few relaxing breaths when you need them the most.</p>
<h5>Full GPS Tracking</h5>
<p>If you&rsquo;re heading on a long bike ride or run, you may want to use your Apple Watch Series 4 to track you. The latest incarnation of the watch offers full GPS tracking, which should make things easier than ever before.</p>
<h2>Power and Numbers</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting things about Apple Watch Series 4 is the brand new S4 chip and 64-bit dual-core processor.</p>
<p>That update means that the device is up to twice as fast as previous models. Typical users (and those who have not had Apple Watches before) may not notice a major difference, but it should make everything feel smoother and quicker.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. The speaker on the Apple Watch is now a massive 50% louder than it was before. Plus, the microphone has been moved further away from the speaker. That means that you won&rsquo;t get an annoying echo when you talk into the device for phone calls, or when using the new Walkie-Talkie feature.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18699" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A0rX_xLhv3ZQUGVdZ-ZO3kzE5aySBBH0XLKy79YNdd64ZGYYYgdIXtWZg1aO3kKorrgMuj5b41DVtMLmxWTkX6SABg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The battery life remains the same as the offering we&rsquo;ve seen on previous models. The &lsquo;all-day&rsquo; battery life lasts for up to 18 hours, which should be fine for most of us. So long as you juice the device up each night, you should have no problem when it comes to power.</p>
<h2>Price and Release date</h2>
<p>If all the above sounds like a dream-come-true, you may be itching to get your hands on Apple Watch Series 4 sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The device is available for pre-order right now, with it due to start shipping for 21 September.</p>
<p>Of course, this type of tech does not come cheap. The starting price is set at &pound;399 and this goes up as you increase the size, add cellular functionality and mix up the materials.</p>
