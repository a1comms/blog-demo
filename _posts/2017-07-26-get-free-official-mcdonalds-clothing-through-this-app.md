<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">McTracksuit, anyone?</span></p>
<p>What could be better than tucking into a delicious Big Mac while wearing a onesie? Why, tucking into a delicious Big Mac while wearing an equally delicious-looking Big Mac onesie, of course! So meta.</p>
<p>It might seem like a crazy dream right now, but it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s about to come true. Yes, McDonald&rsquo;s is launching its own line of clothing, and you can order it via the UberEATS app. But why, you may ask? Well, it&rsquo;s all about celebrating Global Delivery Day, which is on 26th July.</p>
<p>From today, you can log onto the UberEATS app and order more than just a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/mcdonalds-is-launching-home-delivery-with-this-mobile-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald&rsquo;s food delivery</a>; you can also order McDonald&rsquo;s themed clothes and accessories. From slippers that read &lsquo;World Famous&rsquo; across them, to a full World Famous Fries tracksuit, there&rsquo;s something for everyone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14427" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BE1qW2vGSECqjnfiaXbeWU9sgpqzGlqusGb0_7BSkM4o19EIN7HrHIiZSUb6Uyu2vCDEBj2XfRawV_AantP3EpA9=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, how much will these limited-edition pieces cost you? Nothing. They come free when you order a McDonald&rsquo;s meal online via the UberEATS app on 26th July. Yes. You read that right. Of course, they won&rsquo;t be available <em>everywhere </em>around the globe, but you can check out which locations will be offering them <a href="http://mcdeliveryatmcdonalds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official site</a>.</p>
<p>True McDonald&rsquo;s fans will know that this is, in fact, not the first time that the fast food company has released its own merch. Just two years ago, the Big Mac line was launched, which included everything from wallpaper to duvet covers. Still, this latest line of apparel has a wider range of choices and more menu items included. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>

<p>&ldquo;At McDonald&rsquo;s, we continue to raise the bar for our customers&mdash;with new recipes, a fresher look, and now new levels of convenience through <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/mcdonalds-is-launching-home-delivery-with-this-mobile-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDelivery</a> with UberEATS,&rdquo; McDonald&rsquo;s spokesperson Lauren Altmin recently explained in an interview with AdFreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To celebrate, we created the McDelivery Collection, a fun line of items designed to help people savour the delivery experience, whether they&rsquo;re craving a Big Mac snuggled up on their couch or sharing some fries with friends in the park.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, if you fancy getting your mitts on some tasty fry-themed pieces, you know what you&rsquo;ve got to do. Check the site now and see whether your home location is included (fingers crossed!) and then order yourself a cheeky McMeal. You know it makes sense.</p>
