<p><strong><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 10px;" alt="The Best Smartphone - Samsung Galaxy S3" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/samsung_s3.jpg" width="166" height="323" /></strong>It&rsquo;s finally official, the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy SIII&nbsp;(S3) is the Best Smartphone on the market. The Galaxy SIII even pipped the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple">Apple iPhone 5</a>&nbsp;to the post for this award, which was presented by David Walliams at MWC yesterday.</p>
<p>The handset has been a major driving force in securing&nbsp;Samsung&nbsp;the top spot as the world&rsquo;s biggest mobile manufacturer with 40 million sales being confirmed seven months after the original launch date of June 2012. The device is still selling in its droves today.</p>
<p>Not really a surprise as, even if we do say so ourselves, the handset is an incredible device and has certainly been a best-seller here at&nbsp;BuyMobilePhones.net&nbsp;over the last nine months.</p>
<p>Dubbed &lsquo;so much more than just a smartphone&rsquo; by Samsung, the Galaxy SIII is responsive and intuitive, aiming to provide a peaceful experience which has been likened to taking you back to nature.</p>
<p>The 4.8 inch HD Super AMOLED display benefits from a slim bezel to ensure a full viewing experience is delivered, whilst a quad-core processor and 2100mAh battery means this powerful, speedy device can go the distance without running out of juice.</p>
<p>Voted by journalists and industry analysts alike, the award for Samsung is a great way to commemorate the smartphone&rsquo;s success prior to the announcement of its successor, unofficially titled the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s4-event">Samsung Galaxy SIV (S4)</a>, due to be announced in Times Square, New York, at a glitzy event on 14 March 2013.</p>
