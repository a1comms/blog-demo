<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony has created a new flavour of its popular flagship handset, the Sony Xperia Z, to accompany the already beautiful black and white versions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://api.sonymobile.com/files/xperia-z-gallery-03-1240x840-7ecd093f3b661a91374d8ea94bfa2806.png" width="1240" height="840" /></p>
<p>The gorgeous&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z&nbsp;has had a lick of purple paint and looks simply stunning!</p>
<p>Sporting the same slim form factor as before, the purple Sony Xperia Z really stands out from the crowd with its all-glass body and beautiful full 1080p display.</p>
<p>Powered by a QUALCOMM Snapdragon 1.5GHz quad-core chipset the Xperia Z really is a snappy device. It also features some amazing specs in the form of the Full HD display, 16GB storage with expandable options, a 13 megapixel camera with HDR, and even IP57-certification meaning the Sony xperia Z is both dustproof and waterproof.</p>
<p>With Android Jellybean 4.1 on-board, and an update to 4.2 planned very soon, the Sony Xperia Z is a fantastic handset with the perfect balance of beauty and functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Now available in three colours, this handset is a smartphone worthy of anyone&rsquo;s pocket!</strong></p>
