<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Self-repairing screen, yes please.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture the scene. You&rsquo;re on a night out with your pals trying to take the perfect Instagram snap. #WeekendVibes! So, you&rsquo;re holding up your phone and trying to get the most flattering angle for all of you. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s tough work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, out of nowhere, your fingers slip just a little and your phone drops swiftly to the cold, hard dance floor. *Smack* You pick up the device and see it &mdash; a huge crack has appeared right across the screen. What a buzz kill, am I right?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14666 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vIM9lUv0VuKRWQW56AQ37IF6YIMYqNNAqMG_jqM8MwQeKdiOotVF_qdGgQv9pyjty-r96SmXDUcyfmClHziCfXV-=s0" alt="" width="600" height="301" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But wait, what</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your phone could magically &lsquo;heal&rsquo; itself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but it appears that this is just the type of tech that Motorola are working on right now. Their </span><a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20170228094&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=40B199A622C8&amp;HomeUrl=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r=2%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526co1=AND%2526d=PG01%2526s1=motorola%2526s2=thermal%2526OS=motorola%252BAND%252Bthermal%2526RS=motorola%252BAND%252Bthermal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new patent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains how the system could work. According to its details, right after the phone&rsquo;s touchscreen is cracked, it will just apply heat to the area to slightly repair the damage.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14677 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JHb0D1jVkGc_GQRnrOw7J8cIr8ERv60-P1y2ZG7ljzt3pOblbjwsFhjZ8CwPyew-g0WWA41vn3ipAgSNJa1U4Isf=s0" alt="" width="500" height="239" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of this weird (and, yes, very wonderful) idea would be something called &lsquo;shape memory polymer&rsquo;. That is a material which, once broken, can be repaired with a system known as thermal cycling. Let&rsquo;s cut the jargon here. To put things simply, &nbsp;when you heat the material up super fast, it will revert to its original form. Neat.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14668 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XuoApt3avECtPgwKrj89pFea7YsrY5Jqq1xr4rgRBFuPFwWfZL-dseKaq9_0i_6nOoOuJ2yeW4SMM-Jrmv_50NIq=s0" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this material could easily be layered over an LED or LCD screen, and so the user would barely notice that it&rsquo;s there. Once the phone screen becomes cracked, you would either be able to use the polymer system to heal it or you could apply body heat to the area, which should do the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, it&rsquo;s unclear when (if ever) this system will be available. It could be that Motorola are simply patenting the tech while they figure out the logistics of whether it will work or not. Still, if it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">did </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">work, this could easily be the future of phones as we know them. I, for one, wouldn&rsquo;t say no to a self-healing phone screen. Fingers crossed!</span></p>
