<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Samsung Galaxy S5 has hit its first milestone, with Samsung shipping 10 million units out to retailers. </span></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really astounding, though, is how quickly the manufacturer has achieved that; Samsung hit the 10 million shipment milestone in the space of just 25 days! While that doesn&rsquo;t automatically translate into sales to customers, it&rsquo;s nonetheless a sign of just how well the Galaxy S5 is doing!</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5, as with all of its predecessors, is one of the most popular smartphones to hit the market. To get an idea of just how popular it is, one simply needs to look at how many units Samsung has shipped out to retailers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2856/13776141263_2c8ee16fd6_o.jpg" width="325" height="235" /></p>
<p>Samsung has shipped an astounding 10 million Galaxy S5&rsquo;s in the space of just 25 days!</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, let&rsquo;s compare that 25 day figure to the length of time it took for the predecessors of the Galaxy S5 to hit the same milestone; the Galaxy S4 hit the 10 million shipments target in 27 days and the Galaxy S3 hit it in 50 days, while the Galaxy S2 and the original Galaxy S took 5 months and 7 months respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/13776477014_c379f5303c.jpg" width="500" height="119" /></p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s also important to note that this figure represents phones shipped to retailers,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;phones sold to customers, and so it&rsquo;s not quite a&nbsp;<em>true</em>&nbsp;reflection of how well the phone is selling. The fact that 10 million phones have been shipped is not&nbsp;<em>necessarily</em>&nbsp;an indicator that those 10 million phones have been put in customers&rsquo; hands, yet.</p>
<p>The key word there, however, is &lsquo;yet&rsquo;, because each and every flagship Galaxy S phone sells like hotcakes, and while that figure of 25 days is not a direct indicator of success, it&rsquo;s a pretty strong sign nonetheless!</p>
<p><strong>The Galaxy S5 does face stiff competition from other top-end flagships like the Sony Xperia Z2 or the metal-bodied HTC One M8, but based on how quickly it&rsquo;s hit this milestone, we predict Samsung is going to make a mint on this beauty!</strong></p>
