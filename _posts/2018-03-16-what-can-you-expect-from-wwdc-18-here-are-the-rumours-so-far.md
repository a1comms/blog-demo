<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">iOS 12, a new iPhone and lots more!</span></p>
<p>The summer is just around the corner and, for Apple fans, that means just one thing. It&rsquo;s time to start counting down to one of the biggest events in the tech company&rsquo;s calendar.</p>
<p>This year, the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) will take place from 4th to the 8th June at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose.</p>
<p>But what can we expect from the show, and what exciting announcements will be made? Here are some of the biggest rumours floating around the web!</p>
<h2>iOS 12 &amp; More Updates</h2>
<p>Of course, the developer show is really about software, which means that we should hear some rather interesting things about what Apple plans to do next.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re likely to see the announcements of iOS 12, watchOS 5, MacOS 10.14, and tvOS 12. Basically, if you have an Apple product, you can expect an OS update coming your way.</p>

<h2>Apple TV and Movie</h2>
<p>Netflix and Amazon Prime should be quaking in their boots. While Apple Music subscribers can already stream some shows on Apple TV, the latest rumour is that the company plans to create a whole new entertainment platform.</p>
<p>Yes, much like its two rivals, Apple might be commissioning original shows and making content available for its subscribers. Well, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<h2>Revamped iPhone SE</h2>
<p>While we&rsquo;re already spoilt for choice in the iPhone department, we could be in store for just one more surprise.</p>
<p>According to a rumour published on a Chinese <a href="http://new.qq.com/omn/20180219/20180219A0Q3MX.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publication</a>, a new and improved version of the iPhone SE may well be on its way. Of course, it&rsquo;s unclear what exactly this rumour is based on, so we will have to wait and see.</p>
<h2>Mac Pro update</h2>
<p>Right now, we know very little about the upcoming Mac Pro update. We&rsquo;re not even entirely sure when it will be launched. We&rsquo;re hoping to hear some new, exciting titbits of information about this one and what it has in store for us. Watch this space.</p>

<h2>Brand-New iPad Pro</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels of the iPhone X, we&rsquo;re expecting the iPad Pro to have a new look that may be announced at WWDC 18. Many believe that the latest incarnation of this gadget will include the latest Face ID tech.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also talk of it having a larger screen (because, of course!) and maybe taking on a bezeless and minimal look. It could be time to wave goodbye to the home button.</p>
<h2>13-inch MacBook</h2>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s not out of the question that Apple may announce a brand-new MacBook Air at the event. Rumour has it that the latest laptop will be a whopping 13 inches and have an ultra large screen and thin design.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it is believed that it will have a lower price tag than we&rsquo;ve been used, putting it on par with the likes of the MacBook Air. Honestly, we can&rsquo;t wait to see if this is true!</p>
