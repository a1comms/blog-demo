<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This has got to be some sort of joke?</span></p>
<p>Since we switched from the tireless bricks of the early 00s, to today&rsquo;s power-thirsty smartphones, you&rsquo;ve no doubt clocked up a fair few hours plugged into the mains.</p>
<p>If your charging habits are anything like mine, hours aren&rsquo;t an appropriate unit of measurement at all. We&rsquo;re talking about all night, every night, since around 2007.</p>
<p>That sort of thoughtless charging ritual, you&rsquo;re probably just as guilty of, can&rsquo;t be good news for your electricity bill. How could it?</p>

<h2>So, How Much Are We Talking?</h2>
<p>After applying some simple maths to an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a>, as an example (other iPhone models will be similar), it turns out that the cost of charging your device, for an entire year, comes to a grand total of&hellip; wait for it&hellip; 55p.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11685" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Joey-shocked.gif" alt="joey-shocked" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story if you have an Android, like the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> with its standard Samsung adaptive fast charger and USB-C cable for instance.</p>
<h2>Just a Tad Surprising, Right?</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe us? Here&rsquo;s how we worked it out. Start with the cost of a kilowatt hour (kWh), which is an average of about 10p in the UK.</p>
<p>Then look at an iPhone Xs, we know it comes with a 5W (0.005 kilowatts) charger that will juice the 2658 mAh battery up from empty to full, in roughly 3.05 hours.</p>
<p>So, multiply the 3.05 power time with the 5W charger, giving you a total of 15.25W. That&rsquo;s the total amount of electricity your iPhone&nbsp;<em>barely</em>&nbsp;sips from the grid every time you replenish from 0% to 100%. Given that a kilowatt costs 10p, 15.25W will set you back a cool 0.153p. Not even close to a full penny.</p>
<p>Likewise, a Samsung Galaxy S9 non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, will charge in around 2.30 hours from 0% to full. Take the 2.30 charge time multiplied with the 11.55W (0.01155 kilowatts) fast charger output, you&rsquo;ll take 26.56W of juice from the grid. Absorbing this mere 0.265p from your bank balance.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do charge your iPhone Xs every night, extrapolate that 0.153p over 365 days, giving you a yearly bill of around 55.85p.</p>
<p>But wait for this. Charging your Android Samsung Galaxy S9 over a whole year, your bill will come in at a massive 93.44p. Nearly a whole pound. The outrage&hellip;.Today, a Freddo will cost you more. But that&rsquo;s a whole other issue!</p>
