<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It turns out, bigger doesn&rsquo;t always mean better.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tim Cook and his entourage of gawky executives announced a small, new addition to the iPhone family.</p>
<p>Dubbed &ldquo;the most powerful 4-inch phone in the world&rdquo; by the copywriters at Apple, iPhone SE has taken us down memory lane, back two generations to the iconic iPhone 5s, in terms of its size and looks.</p>
<p>But, intriguingly, it boasts the same, exceptionally capable innards as the latest generation, iPhone 6s, which does, in fact, make iPhone SE the most powerful 4-inch phone in the world. Looks can certainly be deceiving.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>iPhone SE revives the design made incredibly popular by iPhone 5s. A design that&rsquo;s comprised of bead-blasted aluminium and a premium glass panel. The edges are matt-chamfered to give it a smooth form that's easy and comfortable to grip. And at 4-inches, iPhone SE is obviously nice and compact, which means it&rsquo;s easier to use one-handed, and is much lighter than typical mobile phones.</p>

<p>The 4-inch Retina display is sharp, despite the lower resolution. But on a device this size, you don&rsquo;t need anything in the realms of what flagship Android mobiles offer. Colours are well balanced and true-to-life, and the brightness lends itself to great visibility even when exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Whilst a bigger display, like that on iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, would be better suited for enjoying video content, iPhone SE still does a great job, and, honestly, doesn&rsquo;t feel too small at all.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Apple claims that this is the &lsquo;only camera you&rsquo;ll ever need&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;re struggling to find reasons to disagree. Fitted with the same 12-megapixel shooter as iPhone 6s, the SE takes remarkably fine and detailed photos, and super-sharp 4K video too.</p>

<p>Through Live Photos, iPhone SE brings your images to life with a brief window of sound and movement. Once you&rsquo;ve taken a shot, go to the gallery, then touch and hold your photo. It&rsquo;s a feature you&rsquo;re bound to have a lot of fun with.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Despite displaying the same measurements as iPhone 5s, this year&rsquo;s iPhone SE boasts a CPU performance that&rsquo;s twice as fast, and a GPU performance that&rsquo;s three times as capable. That&rsquo;s because iPhone SE is built with same advanced A9 chip that&rsquo;s in iPhone 6s, giving users unwavering speed and experience, whether gaming or using apps.</p>

<h2>Apple Pay</h2>
<p>The fingerprint sensor built into the Home button isn&rsquo;t just a convenient method of unlocking iPhone SE. It&rsquo;s also used for authenticating purchases with Apple Pay, which is the Cupertino&rsquo;s wireless transaction process.</p>
<p>Users simply need to hold their iPhone SE up to a wireless terminal, double tap the Home button, leaving their registered thumb or finger on it, and BOOM &ndash; transaction complete. Apple Wallet lets you store different cards, including gift and loyalty cards, so you don&rsquo;t actually need them with you when shopping.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>iPhone SE features all the latest mod-cons, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, a 3.5mm audio jack and NFC (for Apple Pay). It&rsquo;s available in either 16 or 64GB flavours, and a variety of colours that includes space grey, silver, gold and rose gold.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Stylish, functional and mighty powerful, Apple&rsquo;s little iPhone is a great alternative for those wanting a more pocket-friendly device that mixes form and function. With a smaller price tag than that of its bigger siblings, iPhone SE is the perfect option for Apple-loving value-seekers.</p>
