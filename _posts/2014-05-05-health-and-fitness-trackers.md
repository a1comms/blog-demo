<p><span class="postStandFirst">In the modern smartphone era, health and fitness trackers have evolved beyond things like simple pedometers, to become smart accessories that can monitor your fitness, help to improve your health, and even log your entire life for you. Connect one of these up to your Sony Xperia Z2, or your Samsung Galaxy S5 (or whatever phone you&rsquo;re using, naturally), and you can get fit, and improve your quality of life!</span></p>
<p>The modern smartphone world is home to all sorts of things that would have been mere pipe dreams only a few years ago, and one of the most successful new types of products to hit the market is a series of gadgets known as health trackers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve even seen some of the big names in the industry make their own health and fitness trackers and accessories (<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/sony">Sony</a> for one, with the Smartband, and also <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung">Samsung</a>, with the Gear Fit), so if the big names are getting involved, there&rsquo;s clearly a market for these health trackers. But what do health and fitness trackers actually do?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>Health and Fitness Trackers</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7219/14050228254_c3520d8172_o.jpg" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>At their most basic, health trackers can act as fitness trackers, for people who are wanting to use their smartphone to help keep them on an exercise regime. Such a concept isn&rsquo;t without precedent, either; when you connect one up to an HTC One M8 or a <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, or whatever phone you&rsquo;re using, it&rsquo;s perhaps best to think of it as a modernised, smart pedometer. The difference to old style pedometers is, of course, that these health and fitness trackers connect up to an app installed on your smartphone, which not only monitors your exercise regime, but also acts as a kind of personal trainer, offer motivation and encouragement to keep going, instead of just feeding you raw stats.</p>
<p>They can do so much more than just that, however...</p>
<h2>Heart Monitors</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5119/14049736575_bb20619c9c.jpg" width="410" height="500" /></p>
<p>Some modern health trackers like the Basis Carbon Steel go beyond simple accelerometers, in terms of the sensors they use. While they do include those sensors, and can thus work out what activity you&rsquo;re actually doing (such as walking or jogging), the best trackers come with a heart rate monitor, to ensure that you are indeed going for the burn, and getting the most out of your workout.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s when motion sensors and heart-rate monitors combine that something really interesting can be done...</p>
<h2>Sleep Monitors</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7356/14025300836_cd11e4a16e.jpg" width="500" height="284" /></p>
<p>Combining those two types of sensors, health trackers can also work out when you&rsquo;re sleeping, and more importantly, recognise the various stages of sleep. So, in short, as well as helping you to get fit, they can also help you to sleep better!</p>
<p>One tracker takes things further, though, going beyond mere fitness or sleep tracking.</p>
<h2>Life-Logging</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2901/14048890964_c2d85c45f8.jpg" width="500" height="278" /></p>
<p>The gadget in question is the Sony Smartband, and instead of just monitoring your heart rate, or sensing how far you&rsquo;ve walked, it works in conjunction with its associated Android app (to use with phones like the Sony Xperia Z2) to log <em>everything</em> you do. It essentially goes beyond being a mere health tracker, instead becoming a <em>life-logger</em>, which lets you keep track of your movements, your communications, your entertainment preferences, and so on. At the same time, it learns about you, and can then do such clever things as working out when is the best time to wake you up, based on your sleep cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Health and fitness trackers and life-loggers are some of the most successful new product types to have emerged during this modern smartphone era, and it looks like this trend is going to continue for a long time to come!</strong></p>
