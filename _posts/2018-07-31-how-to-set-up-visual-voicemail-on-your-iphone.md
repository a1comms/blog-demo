<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">iPhone users on EE, manage your voicemail messages like a pro using visual voicemail.</span></p>
<p>Having to wade slowly through your voicemails is a pain I need not describe to any iPhone user. It&rsquo;s a particularly unpleasant task when 9 out of 10 turn out to be automated messages, left by those dreaded PPC companies.</p>

<p>What makes the situation even worse, is the fact that you can&rsquo;t simply ignore the fact you have outstanding voicemails, because the pesky little red circle, hovering on top of the Phone app, serves as a constant reminder. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a quick and easy solution. It&rsquo;s called visual voicemail.</p>
<p>Setting up visual voicemail on your iPhone will help manage your voicemails much more easily, by presenting a visual list that allows you to listen to, or delete, individual messages. It&rsquo;s quicker, simpler and just generally far less of a drag than a standard voicemail setup.</p>
<h2>Visual Voicemail for iPhone Users on EE</h2>
<p>Before you get started, make sure your iPhone software is up-to-date. Go to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
<p>1) Activate visual voicemail by texting <strong>iPhone Visual</strong> to 150.</p>
<p>2) Once you receive a reply confirming visual voicemail is set up, turn your WiFi off and restart your iPhone.</p>
<p>3) Reboot your iPhone (you can now turn your WiFi back on), go to the Phone app and tap Voicemail.</p>
<p>You should be presented with a visual list of your voicemail messages, if you have any. Positioned at the top left of the screen, you should also see a tab called Greeting. There, you can set a custom voicemail message.</p>

<p>If, instead, you&rsquo;re presented with a screen that reads, &ldquo;To retrieve a voicemail first set a password and greeting,&rdquo; then tap Set Up Now. Next, create your voicemail password, tap Done, confirm your password again and tap Done. Finally, choose either the default greeting or record your own.</p>
