<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Introducing Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling: call and text whenever you&rsquo;re on Wi-Fi.</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, the good people at Three have just announced a brand new service called Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-wifi-calling-brings-calls-and-texts-to-every-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EE&rsquo;s WiFi Calling</a>, it allows you to use your phone for calling and texting over Wi-Fi, designed to combat poor&nbsp;mobile signal.</p>
<h2>Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling Explained</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more infuriating than losing signal when you&rsquo;re on the train, in a dodgy corner of the office or venturing out of the city.</p>
<p>Well, now with Three, you don&rsquo;t need mobile signal to make a call or send a text. Not when you&rsquo;ve got a decent Wi-Fi signal available.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13283" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w_mchlLnaOM7EBRbyIhhmhB6kl365cwbEC3sOs79sze-fvJTgL-NL0kwpjp4w_k8dvOHT9vzVEcAUN8YzIdY334=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree that this service will be seriously useful, especially if you&rsquo;re unlucky enough to live in one of the UK&rsquo;s signal blackspots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one drawback: you need to own a compatible phone to be able to use Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling at the moment. The full lists are below, as well as details on how to set Three inTouch up on your Three-connected iPhone or Android.</p>
<h2>How to Get Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling on iPhone</h2>
<p>First up, you need one of the following compatible Apple devices: iPhone 7, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, iPhone 6s, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-6s-plus-32gb-rose-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 6s Plus</a>, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 5s or iPhone 5c.</p>
<p>Next, make sure your software is up to date, by going to <strong>Settings > General > Software Update</strong>. If you want to use Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling, you will need to be running on iOS 10.2 or later.</p>
<p>You might also need to update your network settings, which you can do by going to <strong>Settings > General > About</strong>. Tap <strong>Update</strong> if your Carrier Settings pop up.</p>
<p>Once all that&rsquo;s done, you simply need to go to <strong>Settings > Phone > WiFi Calling</strong>, and <strong>WiFi Calling on This iPhone</strong> to the right. You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s working, because &ldquo;Three WiFi Call&rdquo; will appear at the top of your iPhone.</p>

<h2>How to Get Three inTouch Wi-Fi Calling on Android</h2>
<p>As of February 2017, Three&rsquo;s Wi-Fi Calling feature is pretty limited on Android devices. You need one of the following: <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a>, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge or LG G5.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to own one of the Three InTouch compatible devices, make sure you&rsquo;re running the latest software. Once you&rsquo;re up-to-date, you won&rsquo;t need to do anything else. Wi-Fi Calling will be automatically enabled; you'll see a small icon depicting a phone below a Wi-Fi signal.</p>
