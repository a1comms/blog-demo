<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple Music is Livin&rsquo; on a Prayer with this latest news!</span></p>
<p>So, there are a few major players when it comes to music streaming services. You have Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Tidal and others like Amazon Music, Google Play Music and YouTube Music, all of which want a slice of the action. When you think about it, there are actually loads to chose from.</p>
<p>But, with all that choice, who can possibly Rule The World, when it comes to the amount of paying subscribers?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/07/05/apple-music-spotify-us-subscribers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Music News</a>, Spotify has over 70 million subscribers glabally. Who knew that for all this time that Spotify was at the top of the charts. But it all that about to change?</p>

<h2>Stand By Me!</h2>
<p>Digital Music News goes on to claim that Apple Music now has more paying subscribers than Spotify!</p>
<p>The source has stated this recently on the back of a super-secret meeting, that now, well, may as well as not be secret at all.</p>
<p>Here are some numbers to put things in perspective. Both Apple Music and Spotify have more than 20 million subscribers in the US alone.</p>
<p>Globally, Apple Music has more than 45 million subscribers. With an additional&nbsp;5-10 million estimated free trial users.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spotify has over 70 million paying subscribers worldwide and 160 million overall users.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some serious music streaming going down! But how do you pick between the two?</p>

<h2>Beat it!</h2>
<p>The source reports that Apple Music will get the Jump! (Van Halen) on Spotify with a predicted gap emerging between the two services towards the end of 2018.</p>
<p>This could be down to many things, but here at home in the UK, Apple Music is a benefit of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EE mobile plans</a>, with 6 months' free subscription. Nice. It's also available on a free 3 month trial on both Android and Apple smartphones or tablets, regardless of your chosen mobile network.</p>
<p>Similarly, Vodafone has a counter offer with Spotify Premium, giving away this perk on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/vodafone-deals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Entertainment plans</a> for a massive 24 months. Even sweeter!</p>
<p>Spotify is also available on a free plan (with ads) and offers a free 30-day trial for the Premium service. And, in case you were wondering, it too is also available on both Android and Apple phones or tablets. Although, we're not sure about one of its latest adverts... (#awkwarddinnerbanter...)</p>

<p>Overall, both streaming services offer similar perks and benefits, but we&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to decide which one you prefer. Why not try them both out! (While you're at it, try and work some terrible music puns into your day, but please don't use this article as a benchmark, you can do much better.)</p>
<p>So, watch this space, folks, Apple Music could easily become more popular than Spotify in the UK before long. Happy streaming!</p>
