<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Your face is your password.</span></p>
<p>If you thought the hype around iPhone X was dying down, you were wrong! In fact, the good people at Apple released a funny video to advertise the device. This advert is called &lsquo;Memory&rsquo; and looks at &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; all that Face ID has to offer.</p>
<p>It opens on a theatre full of people as the camera quickly pans to the stage. There&rsquo;s a long table in the middle; a host and contestant sitting at each end. The mood is tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning you created an online banking password,&rdquo; says the quizmaster as he leans in closer to the contestant, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The audience members gasp at the thought of having to recall such information. The message is clear &ndash; none of us can remember the multitude of passcodes and words we&rsquo;re forced to make on a daily basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15907 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xe84r31urIHGAORD6Vw6t1xlIG8p2Z__Cd7uH2Mf_1FN91-4th5eQuoF7vAaXYbnNPC5q-Z7dKknru8d2fdgxK0=s0" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh okay &ndash; It&rsquo;s mine so I&rsquo;ll remember it&hellip;&rdquo; stumbles the contestant. It&rsquo;s quite clear that he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue what the password is. As he tries to convince himself and, perhaps the audience, that he knows what he&rsquo;s doing, the countdown begins. He has just 30 seconds.</p>
<p>People in the crowd start to heckle &ndash; &ldquo;Need a hint?!&rdquo; &ndash; laugh, and jeer. The time&rsquo;s almost up. The clock is almost out of time. But then, in a moment of sheer genius, the contestant glances down at his iPhone X. His Face ID feature works and the password field is filled automatically. It turns out that he didn&rsquo;t need to remember it after all.</p>

<p>As the man recovers from the pressure of the &lsquo;memory test&rsquo; and a look of relief passes across his worried face, some cheerful congratulatory music plays in the background. Apple then deliver the punchline of the entire advert &ndash; &lsquo;Your face is your password.&rsquo; We hear you, geniuses. Loud and clear.</p>
