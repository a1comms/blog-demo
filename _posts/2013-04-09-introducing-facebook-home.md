<p><span class="postStandFirst">The social media giant has entered the mobile phone game with its own unique twist to the massively popular Android platform.</span></p>
<p>Facebook Home has been created to offer a smartphone experience that works on, and with, the Android platform, bringing together all aspects of your Facebook world with a quick and easy user interface.</p>
<p>With Facebook Home, the moment you turn it on, you see a steady stream of friends&rsquo; posts and photos so you are always kept in the loop. Notifications appear upfront and quick access to your essentials mean you&rsquo;ll never miss a moment. You can even keep chatting with friends, even when you&rsquo;re using other apps.</p>
<p>Facebook Home comes complete with a function called Cover Feed. As soon as you turn on your phone one quick press of the home button will enable a stream of posts to appear from your news feed.</p>
<p>Home also brings with it the ability to multitask, so whether you are watching your favourite video, browsing the web or simply taking a photo you can still chat to your friends either via group chat or one-on-one.</p>
<p>Messaging is also integrated so all your Facebook messages and texts show in one place, allowing you to jump in and out of chats with simply a press of the profile picture or icon.</p>
<p>Apps are taken care of via the app launcher which offers both an essential tray which houses apps like Instagram, Messenger and even Facebook itself.</p>
<p>You also get access to all your apps and can add more via the Google Play store.</p>
<p>With usability in mind you also have shortcuts to your favourite options, simply by dragging your profile picture icon you can access your apps, chat to a friend or go back to a previously opened app.</p>
<p>Facebook Home offers a top notch social media experience, and is a great alternative solution to the standard android platform.</p>
<p><strong>It will be available to download for selected handsets as of the 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of April from the Google Play store completely free.</strong></p>
