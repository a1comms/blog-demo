<p>Big news. After more than 20 years at Apple, Sir Jony Ive is set to make his departure.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The British designer is responsible for the awe-inspiring designs including the classic iPhone, iPad and iMac.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, not all his product designs were huge hits. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s take a look at five remarkable goals and misfires.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>1) The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM)</h2>

<p>The Twentieth Century Macintosh was a special release to mark the brand&rsquo;s 20th anniversary. Coming in at more than &pound;9,000, the limited-edition product was not for your everyday computer user. The high price tag meant that the device didn&rsquo;t sell well. Six months into the TAM&rsquo;s release, the price was dropped.</p>

<h2>2) Toilet-Come-Sink</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":20943,"align":"center","className":"size-full wp-image-20943"} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-20943">

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Why have a separate toilet and sink when you can have two-in-one? While working for London-based design agency, Tangerine, Ive designed a toilet basin. Yes, that&rsquo;s a toilet that doubles as a sink. Just what nobody needed. Ever. Rather unsurprisingly, the agency&rsquo;s client Ideal Standard were not all that blown away by the product idea.</p>

<h2>3) All-Diamond Ring</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":20941,"align":"center","className":"size-full wp-image-20941"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a real head-turner. Rather than having a diamond ring where the stone is set in a precious metal, a la gold or even platinum. However, Ive had a better and altogether more lavish idea for how these products should work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As part of a charitable collaboration with Marc Newson, the designer created a ring made completely of diamond. To create this feat, the duo used a laser-guided water jet to cut an exact circle into a piece of solid diamond. The piece sold for $250,000.</p>

<h2>4) Hockey Puck Mouse</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":20939,"align":"center","className":"wp-image-20939 size-full"} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-20939 size-full">

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, the average computer mouse is boring. In 1998, Ive went about addressing this problem. As part of the release of the iMac G3, there was also a USB connected mouse. Like the computer, the round, hockey puck-shaped objects were transparent with small blocks of colour.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sadly, the mouse did not go down too well with customers. Many criticised them for being hard to use, guide and, generally, keep hold of. Bit of a problem there.</p>

<h2>5) Leica Camera</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":20940,"align":"center","className":"size-full wp-image-20940"} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-20940">

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In another collaboration with Marc Newson in 2013, Ive designed a one-of-a-kind Leica Digital Rangefinder. Sporting an entirely aluminium body, the sleek camera was as stylish as it was slick. What&rsquo;s more, this was all for a good cause. The special edition device was auctioned off with funds going to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.</p>
