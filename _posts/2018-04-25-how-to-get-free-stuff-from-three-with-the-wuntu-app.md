<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Do you even Wuntu, bro? Get freebies and exclusive offers on Three.</span></p>
<p>We all like to get something for nothing right? Of course you do.</p>
<p>Well Three is into helping its customers get the things they love, either for free or at a lovely disocunt, so put your wallet away.</p>
<p>Calling all Three customers, old and new, here's what the Wuntu app from Three is all about.</p>
<h2>What Is Wuntu?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about spreading the love, folks. As a thank you, Three is willing to give you offers and rewards every week, simply for being a Three customer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially Three&rsquo;s way of saying thanks. With a free to download app that&rsquo;s full of joy!</p>
<p>Offers can include everything from money-off promotions (saving you money on eating out for example), freebies from various brands (such as a free coffee), and exclusive competitions too.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's Wuntu's first birthday (big ups!) &amp; Three customers can celebrate with <a href="https://twitter.com/valeriecafe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ValerieCafe</a> with a free slice of delicious cake and a hot drink. Get in.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wuntu?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Wuntu</a>. Cheers everyone! &#x1f449; <a href="https://t.co/7dAx11noD8">https://t.co/7dAx11noD8</a> <a href="https://t.co/zLRK362cYc">pic.twitter.com/zLRK362cYc</a></p>

<h2>How Does Wuntu Work?</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the app, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll simply be sent offers every week, beamed straight to your smartphone. Meaning you can either save and use, or simply ignore them if you don&rsquo;t fancy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth keeping tabs on everything though, as competitions, for instance, will often be time limited, and you don&rsquo;t want to miss out after all.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also get special deals as a Three customer and Wuntu app user. These will be on other Three products, such as tablets, SIM deals and other mobile contracts that aren&rsquo;t available to the wider world, apart from you lucky Wuntu users.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other thing too, you&rsquo;ll likely get offers served to you based on what deals you&rsquo;ve claimed in the past, or in short, the stuff you actually like. There&rsquo;s no point getting loads of offers for Superdrug and make-up products when you regularly cash in on free food offers.</p>
