<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">PPI callers, we will find you, and we will kill you.</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than receiving a call from an unknown number, thinking it might be that job interview you&rsquo;ve been waiting for, or a delivery making its way, only to answer to a monotone voice claiming &ldquo;Our records say you have recently been in an accident&rdquo; or &ldquo;Have you been mis-sold PPI insurance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spammy cold calls aren&rsquo;t just an inconvenience, they can be infuriating at the wrong time, causing those with zero chill to unleash irreparable damage on their personal belongings, in some sort of phone-to-wall collision.</p>

<h2>1. Sign up to TPS</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), then it&rsquo;s about to become your new best friend in the fight against spam callers.</p>
<p>Register your phone number with TPS, which is quick and completely free to use, and thereinafter it becomes illegal for unsolicited sales and marketing calls to be directed at your number.</p>
<p>Though&hellip; you may receive advertisers&rsquo; text messages, which isn&rsquo;t ideal, but is much easier to deal with - just hit delete.</p>
<p>If, somehow, a spam call slips through the net, you can report the company and get them in a lot of hot water &ndash; it's a double win. If you&rsquo;re interested, <a href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/index.html">register your number with TPS</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Block the Number</h2>
<p>Perhaps the quickest solution is to block each son of a gun who dials your number. You won&rsquo;t necessarily prevent new cold calls, but you won&rsquo;t have to deal with repeat harassment from the same source.</p>
<p>On your iPhone, tap the <strong>Phone</strong> icon to see your call history. Tap the little information icon followed by <strong>Block this Caller</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple block-per-call basis going forward. After a couple of months, if you&rsquo;re as sad as me, your blocked call list will look longer than your message thread.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so lonely.</p>
<h2>3. Install the Latest iOS</h2>
<p>Apple's iPhone software isn't just to&nbsp;pimp out&nbsp;Siri with mad new skills, or give your iPhone the ability to automatically work out who's in your photos. It's got the ability to recognise when incoming calls are likely to be spam, and&nbsp;notify you.</p>
<p>So make sure you're running the latest version of iOS, to get all the best features. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>General</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong>, and install any available updates.</p>
