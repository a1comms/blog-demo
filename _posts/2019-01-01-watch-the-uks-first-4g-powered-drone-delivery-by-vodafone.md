<p>Christmas may be but a distant memory now, but there&rsquo;s still one festive themed story that you&rsquo;ll want to hear.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s skies saw a special flight taking place recently, when a model of the Man in Red was fitted to the top of a drone and flown across country. Ho ho ho holy moly!</p>
<p>This weird occurrence was thanks to the good people at Vodafone who organised a special delivery service for lucky remote workers,&nbsp;at the Portland Bill Coastwatch in Dorset, who keep people safe both on land and sea.</p>
<p>The folks at Vodafone wanted to give back to the team who were helping the wider community but, were not able to spend Christmas with their loved ones. To send a little Christmas cheer their way, the Vodafone company made up gift hampers and delivered them by drone.</p>

<p>Since Portland&rsquo;s coastline is difficult to get to, sending gifts and surprises there can be quite a tricky feat. Luckily, Vodafone solved this problem by using a 4G-powered drone.</p>
<p>Of course, given that this delivery took place in Yuletide, the drone was made up as a Santa sleigh. It was the only logical thing to do.</p>
<p>Plus, as though that little festive twist wasn&rsquo;t enough to make this a special ride, the drone was also the first ever one to be piloted by a 4G mobile network. Exciting.</p>
<p>Usually, drones communicate with pilots via a radio link. However, this particular method means that the drones don&rsquo;t typically have a wide range.</p>
<p>In fact, the drones need to stay near to the radios to maintain signals at all times. That means that making deliveries with them isn&rsquo;t so convenient and that only short trips can be completed.</p>

<h2>The Future of Drone Deliveries</h2>
<p>Thankfully, as the 4G network now reaches 99% of the UK population, drones can now cover a much wider distance. That&rsquo;s the very technology that Vodafone used to make sure that the volunteers got their hampers on time this year. The flight was a huge success and could be a sign of things to come in the not-so-far future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology plays an increasingly important role in connecting people over Christmas,&rdquo; explained Vodafone UK&rsquo;s CTO, Scott Petty on the company&rsquo;s own <a href="https://blog.vodafone.co.uk/2018/12/18/christmas-drone-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>. &ldquo;And flying a drone over 4G for the first time gives us a glimpse of what Christmas deliveries of the future might look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/vodafone-is-taking-on-ee-with-its-own-5g-trials-in-these-7-uk-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone 5G network</a> is soon to be rolled out around the country, Christmas 2019 might look very different.</p>
<p>This year, perhaps we will all be receiving our presents and even food hampers via mobile-powered drones. Watch this space.</p>
