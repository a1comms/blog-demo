<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">May the Force be with you!</span></p>
<p>In the lead up to the much-awaited release of <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, fans of the Force may be looking for ways to get their fix.</p>
<p>Luckily, Lenovo and Disney have teamed up to give us the ultimate gift just before the blockbuster finally hits cinemas on December 15. Together, they have created an AR game that allows users to become real Jedis. Well, sort of.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e__9IUpdj8Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, the video makes the game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Jedi Challenges&nbsp;</em>look incredibly swish.</p>
<p>To play it, though, you&rsquo;ll need some hefty gear, which comes in three different parts: a lightsaber controller, a Lenovo headset, and a tracking beacon. Once you have all of the above, the idea is that you get to complete challenges, just like a Jedi would in the movies.</p>
<h2>Lightsaber Battles</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to fight your enemies with a lightsaber, here&rsquo;s your chance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the game is the lightsaber battles. You can choose who you want to battle, be it a one-on-one fight with the likes of Kylo Ren or Darth Vader, or an epic battle against enemy troops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15643" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pa4-RKl_yx2ZKy7tYVWDq2BvyrVsfhq0OpdPunDLGVYl2Npu2m_jzyVN0KMTXh1hcRdJmygbbfF-7WUktPSrflXE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The more you play, the higher the rank your character gets and you can move through six different planets (i.e. levels).</p>
<h2>Strategic Combat</h2>
<p>Of course, as any Star Wars fan knows, it&rsquo;s not all about how you yield your lightsaber. There&rsquo;s a whole lot of brainpower that goes into defeating the enemy too. That&rsquo;s where the strategic element comes into play...</p>
<p>The AR game allows you to command armies in epic wars. You&rsquo;ll get the chance to recreate some of the most infamous battles from the franchise and play them out how you see fit. Hmm, amazing this sounds.</p>

<h2>Holochess</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real &mdash; since the Holochess game made a brief appearance in <em>A New Hope&nbsp;</em>(then once again in <em>The Force Awakens</em>)&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for a chance to try it for ourselves.</p>
<p>Well, here it is. <em>Star Wars: Jedi Challenges</em>&nbsp;allows you to direct your alien pieces to win territory and defeat enemies. You can collect different creatures as you play the game too, which means that the more you play, the stronger your chess troops will be.</p>

<h2>Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>Should all of the above sound like a geeky dream come true, you may be wondering when you can get your hands on <em>Star Wars: Jedi Challenges</em>. The answer is sooner than you think. The game is already available to order and costs &pound;249.99. While that may sound like a big chunk of money, you can&rsquo;t put a price on living out your Star Wars fantasy. (But, of course, Disney and Lenovo can.)</p>
