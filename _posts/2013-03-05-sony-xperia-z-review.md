<p><span class="postStandFirst">The latest premium handset from Sony is here... The Xperia Z is powerful, rugged, yet beautiful to behold, and looks set to cause a stir in the smartphone world!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8530409643_778ee2dde5.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia Z</a>&nbsp;sports a 1080p 440ppi 5 inch display, with Sony Mobile Bravia Engine 2 technology behind it, making the screen not only beautiful to look at, but functional too.</p>
<p>The handset measures 139 x 71 x 7.9mm and weighs in at 149g, so despite having one of the largest displays out there, without crossing into tablet territory, it isn't the heaviest device around. That's all down to the smart choice of materials, a tempered Dragontail glass front and back, fused in a glass fibre frame - a build quality which makes the device feel premium.</p>
<p>In terms of physical controls it seems that less is more with the Xperia Z. The aluminium standby button sits in the middle of the right-hand side, making access easy, whilst below is the volume rocker key, keeping in with the functional and minimalistic design.<strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8531521376_fb08cd0cfb.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The handset is both waterproof and dustproof, awarding it an IP57-certification and, with the inclusion of Sony&rsquo;s finger-tracking technology, making calls in the rain, the bath or the shower is no longer a concern!</p>
<p>As the Xperia Z is waterproof all the ports and connections have covers with rubber &lsquo;O&rsquo; rings integrated to keep dust and water out. This includes the SIM tray, 3.5mm headphone socket, USB port and microSD card slot.</p>
<p>The internals of the Xperia Z are top notch, easily surpassing the mighty&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3. It offers the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset clocked at 1.5GHz with quad-core power, backed by 2GB of RAM, meaning the Sony Xperia Z is slick, fast and a pleasure to use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 16GB of internal storage with the added benefit of a microSD card slot for expansion. Elsewhere you&rsquo;ll find that the Sony Xperia Z is fully connected: you&rsquo;ve got all the wireless connections you expect, including NFC and 4G LTE for&nbsp;superfast 4GEE internet on the EE network.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8530971257_d42512f124.jpg" width="333" height="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Sony Xperia Z isn&rsquo;t awkward for making calls, despite the large size of the phone. There&rsquo;s a sharp edge across the top, as there is around the phone, but unlike smaller handsets, it doesn't dig into your ear uncomfortably when on long calls. To assist your calling, there&rsquo;s a range of options, including noise suppression and the option to slow down the caller.</p>
<p>The battery is sealed inside the handset so cannot be changed. It&rsquo;s a 2330mAh cell, but it&rsquo;s the management of this battery that&rsquo;s important and Sony&rsquo;s smart power management options certainly are impressive. Many devices of this sort of size and power will burn through the battery unchecked in half a day. But with the customisable options Sony offers, you will find that the battery will simply keep on going. You also get smart Wi-Fi which detects when you&rsquo;re not in a familiar area and shuts the Wi-Fi off automatically.</p>
<p>The Xperia Z ships with Android 4.1.2, with a light dash of Sony customisation over the top, and the promise of the Android 4.2.1 update soon after launch. One of the trademarks of Sony phones has always been the quantity of bundled apps like Music Unlimited, Wisepilot, Sony Select, PlayNow and TrackID and the Xperia Z certainly doesn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>Offering you a 13 megapixel Exmor R for mobile sensor for the rear camera, and a 2 megapixel unit on the front, the camera is fast and has an excellent picture quality. This is the first smartphone to offer HDR video recording, and there&rsquo;s also a range of smart options like burst shooting, picture effects and panoramic mode to keep you entertained whilst ensuring you snap some fantastic photos.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8531529670_7e7621c4b4.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to playback, video looks fantastic on the Xperia Z thanks to that huge screen. Whether it&rsquo;s a movie you&rsquo;ve recorded or one you&rsquo;re streaming, it's a pleasure to watch and a completely immersive experience.</p>
<p>On the music front, Sony is the Walkman app offering, a nice visual design, as well as integrated sharing, the option to download artwork and tweak the sound output.</p>
<p>Adding a boost to the audio is Sony&rsquo;s ClearAudio+, which, quite simply, allows you to make your music sound better. You can tweak the equaliser if there are specific changes you wish to make to the way your device sounds, then attach a pair of headphones and enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p><em>Sony really has come out with all guns blazing to offer this incredibly well-rounded premium smartphone and, in the meantime, setting new standards in screen technology and media. With the smartphone battle about to shift up a gear Sony could have well and truly created the handset of the season with the Xperia Z.</em></p>
