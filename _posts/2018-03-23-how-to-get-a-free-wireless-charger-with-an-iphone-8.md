<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Wireless chargers are the future&hellip; And now they&rsquo;re free!</span></p>
<p>Forget tangled cables and needless hassle. The future of charging is&hellip; wireless. While we&rsquo;ve seen a few phones adopt this type of charging in the past, Apple is the latest big brand to get on board. Yes, both the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Plus</a> offer this super cool feature.</p>
<p>Not forgetting iPhone X as well, of course&hellip;</p>
<p>That means that charging your phone at home, or even on the go couldn&rsquo;t be easier. The latest iPhones&rsquo; new design includes a glass back that works with a range of Qi-certified chargers. So, when your battery life is looking a little less than healthy, all you need to do is place your phone face-up on a charger and watch it go.</p>

<p>Just a few seconds after you pop your shiny new iPhone 8 down onto the charger, you should see the little lightning bolt symbol appear, which means that your iPhone is about to get some much-needed power.</p>
<p>Not only does this feature feel futuristic, but it also means that you no longer have to worry about plugging in cables or carrying a charger with you. In fact, certified chargers are soon to be available in coffee shops, hotels, and airports. They&rsquo;re already in McDonald&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>So, wherever you happen to be, you should be able to find a cheeky charging spot. (That takes care of that &lsquo;red battery&rsquo; panic!)</p>
<h2>How to Get a Free Wireless Charger</h2>
<p>But wait, aren&rsquo;t wireless chargers super expensive? Well, no, they don&rsquo;t have to be. There&rsquo;s a whole range of options already out there. What&rsquo;s more, if you play your cards right, you can nab yourself a new Belkin wireless charger for the sweet price of nothing at all. Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>We all love a freebie, so here&rsquo;s a treat. When you buy an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus on an EE contract with us at Buymobiles.net, you get a Belkin charger (worth &pound;29.99) thrown into the bundle for free. That means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about paying extra to use wireless charging. What could be better than that?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.belkin.com/uk/p/P-F8M747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOST&uarr;UP Qi Wireless Charging Pad</a> is a Qi enabled device that uses the latest technology to offer a simple charging system. There&rsquo;s even a little LED light on the charger that lights up to let you know when your device is charging optimally.</p>
<p>Oh, and it just so happens to look pretty suave too. The elegant design and slim look of the charger means that it will look perfect anywhere in your abode. Or even in the office. Sweet.</p>
