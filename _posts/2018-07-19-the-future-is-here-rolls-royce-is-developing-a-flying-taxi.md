<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Watch out Uber and Airbus!</span></p>
<p>Imagine a world where, at the touch of a button, you could call your own personal aeroplane. It may sound Black Mirror esque but it&rsquo;s not as wild an idea as you might imagine. Yes, the future could be skies littered with flying taxis.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, major companies, such as Uber and Airbus, have previously stated that they are working vehicles of this nature. However, they&rsquo;ve now got competition from a rather unexpected place. Rolls-Royce has just <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/our-stories/discover/2018/blue-sky-thinking-rr-unveils-evtol-concept-at-farnborough-airshow.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a concept for electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) &ndash; an air taxi.</p>
<p>The vehicle was unveiled as part of the recent Farnborough International Airshow 2018. This latest innovation will help the brand &lsquo;become the world&rsquo;s leading industrial technology company,&rsquo; according to a statement on its own site. Although the name suggests otherwise, the taxi will not be entirely electric. The six plane propellers would use gas turbines to get the power they need to fly.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 57%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/LoblRmXnDEW08" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept vehicle would be large enough to carry four-to-five people at a time. Picture yourself ride-sharing an actual plane across the country! The peak speed for these taxis would be around 250 MPH and, in theory, they could travel up to 500 miles per trip.</p>
<p>Plus, when descending, the plane wing propellers would fold away, making for a smooth landing. The company said that the fold-away propellers would mean that there is less noise or interruption for both passengers and civilians. Oh, and the wings can also rotate 90-degrees because, of course, they can!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Electrification is an exciting and inescapable trend across industrial technology markets and while the move to more electric propulsion will be gradual for us, it will ultimately be a revolution,&rdquo; said Rob Watson, head of Rolls-Royce&rsquo;s Electrical team, in a statement on its site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rolls-Royce has a strong track record as pioneers in aviation. From developing the first turboprop and jet engines, to creating the world&rsquo;s most efficient large civil aero-engine and vertical take-off and landing solutions, we have a very strong pedigree. As the third generation of aviation begins to dawn, it&rsquo;s time to be pioneers yet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the prospect of a flying taxi has you whipped into a frenzy of excitement, we have some great news for you. It may no longer be a sci-fi fantasy. Rolls-Royce say that, so long as there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;viable commercial model for its introduction,&rsquo; the model could be available by the early to mid-2020s. Fingers crossed!</p>
