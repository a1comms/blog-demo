<p><span class="postStandFirst">After announcing the Android-powered Nokia X, Microsoft has now confirmed that it will not be producing future Android phones, instead focusing its efforts on producing better Windows phones, especially to compete in mid-range categories in which the X-series would have competed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4653 aligncenter" alt="Nokia X2" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Nokia-X2.png" width="738" height="705" /></p>
<p>After the company had switched to using Windows Phone in all of its smartphones, people were not too shocked when Microsoft bought Nokia. It was much more surprising, however, when the <i>Android-powered</i> Nokia X debuted.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising part was when the Nokia X2, Nokia&rsquo;s second Android phone, debuted <i>after</i> Microsoft&rsquo;s acquisition had been finalised; now, according to The Verge, it turns out that the Nokia X2 will be the company&rsquo;s <i>last</i> Android phone.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of the wider announcement that Microsoft is set to make 18,000 redundancies within the next year. As part of this, according to Microsoft&rsquo;s Stephen Elop, the company will be cutting development of future Android phones, and rolling that work into future budget Windows handsets (although Microsoft <i>will</i> continue to support existing Nokia X phones).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all honesty, many people didn&rsquo;t expect the Nokia Android experiment to last even <i>this</i> long, and to be fair, this could prove to be a good move for Microsoft. Windows Phone is gaining traction in the market (especially in developing markets, and in the USA), but it still can&rsquo;t match the market share of Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the LG G3.</p>
<p>Thus, focusing on making Windows Phone a success, instead of dividing the company&rsquo;s efforts between two platforms, seems like it could be a smart move.</p>
<p><strong>At the very least, this means that we should see some really nice mid-range Windows phones coming, to compete with phones like the Moto G. That&rsquo;s going to be very interesting to see, so stay tuned for more news!&nbsp;</strong></p>
