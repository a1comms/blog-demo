<p>The release of iOS 12 has brought with it <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/the-best-ios-12-tips-and-tricks-you-have-to-try-for-yourself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some cool updates</a> to iPhone. So, if you&rsquo;ve got an iPhone X, or even a brand-spanking-new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a> or Xs Max, there&rsquo;s one fresh feature you mustn&rsquo;t overlook.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about Memoji.</p>
<h2>First of All, What is Memoji?</h2>
<p>If you were a teen in the early 2000s, this particular iOS 12 feature is going to give you some serious nostalgia pangs. Prepare yourself. Let me take you back to a time when we all spent far too much of our youth on a little PC game known as The Sims.</p>
<p>Does it ring a bell? Oh yes, many of us would whittle away the hours on this game. Without a shadow of a doubt (and I dare you to contradict me here!), the greatest feature on The Sims was at the beginning when you created your own character. Manipulating the face shape, hairstyle, and other features was oddly satisfying, as you tried to achieve personal resemblance.</p>
<p>Well, Apple is tapping into that feeling once again. Say hello to Memoji.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the iOS 12 feature is a type of Animoji that looks just like you, or any way you choose. Rather than using premade emoji, like the ever-popular tiger, you can design your very own character.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve created your Memoji, you can use it just like an Animoji&hellip; But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself here. Let&rsquo;s talk about how you can get started.</p>
<h2>How to Create Your Memoji</h2>
<p>To create your own Memoji, you need to start by heading to the Messages app on your iPhone. Open a chat with someone and then look for the little Animoji icon. Next, tap on the + symbol to start crafting your Memoji.</p>

<p>This is where the fun begins. You&rsquo;ll be presented with a creation deck much like the one you used on The Sims back in the day. You can control the facial features, hair, skin, eye-wear, and head-wear of your Memoji, to create an animated version of yourself, or a wild interpretation of your inner character.</p>
<h2>What to Do With Your Memoji</h2>
<p>When your Memoji is ready, you&rsquo;re going to want to start using it pronto. There are two main things you can do.</p>
<p>First, you can use the True Depth camera to record 30-second clips of you as a Memoji, which you can send as messages. You might want to make a short video of you singing or chatting away in character.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not all&hellip; With iOS 12, comes a brand-new trick you can try. The Messages camera effects feature allows you to replace your head with a Memoji when you&rsquo;re taking a photo or a video. Give it a whirl &ndash; you know you want to.</p>
