<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Find out what the future of Samsung looks like.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to pull out your crystal balls, gaze into them, and see what the future of tech holds for smartphones.</p>
<p>While Samsung Galaxy S8 is still brand-spanking-new and totally state-of-the-art, rumours of the next flagship Samsung smartphone have already started&hellip;</p>
<p>So, what do we know about Samsung Galaxy S9 (if that&rsquo;s even what it will be called) so far? Here&rsquo;s a quick round-up of popular rumours from around the internet.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Camera Rumours</h2>
<p>While nothing is certain at this stage, serial leaker @UniverseIce claims that Samsung Galaxy S9 will feature a 3D sensor in the front camera. The source didn&rsquo;t go into any more detail than that.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Galaxy S9 will use 3D sensor front camera</p>
<p>&mdash; Ice universe (@UniverseIce) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/918471460045205505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, some have speculated that this particular feature could be strikingly similar to Apple&rsquo;s Face ID function. The notion that the camera can map out a 3D image means that rumoured Galaxy S9 could support similar security features to iPhone X.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to point out that, right now, this is nothing more than mere speculation. All too often, we find that these rumours never actually come to fruition. Still, of the Samsung Galaxy S9 rumours we&rsquo;ve read, this seems likely given how popular Face ID is becoming for Apple.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Performance Rumours</h2>
<p>Samsung recently revealed that its latest chipset will be known as the Exynos 9810. Of course, nothing was said about whether this chip will be used in the next Samsung Galaxy flagship.</p>
<p>This chipset should feature an LTE modem that supports download speeds of 1.2Gbps, which would make it faster than any other flagship device. You could download an HD movie in about 10 seconds, or an epic new game in even less.</p>

<p>In another Samsung Galaxy S9 rumour, <a href="http://www.theinvestor.co.kr/view.php?ud=20170424000688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Investor</a> suggests that the smartphone will boast a new chipset designed by both Samsung and Qualcomm. Watch this space!</p>
<p>As for RAM, some rumours suggest that the Galaxy S9 could have less than most expect. In fact, it could be as small as a mere 4GB of RAM. Some smartphones already feature 6GB, so that would be quite a modest move.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Fingerprint Sensor Rumours</h2>
<p>The fingerprint sensor on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S8 certainly divided people. Some love it where it&rsquo;s located, some not so much. So what&rsquo;s the solution?</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/06/28/qualcomm-announces-advanced-fingerprint-scanning-and-authentication?_ga=2.186717483.2099836640.1498739879-853364731.1498739879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qualcomm fingerprint sensor</a> can sit below thick layers of glass and still work. With that in mind, some believe the next Samsung Galaxy smartphone could feature such a sensor, sat beneath the front screen and display. This Samsung Galaxy S9 feature would mean you could unlock it from the display, without valuable space being used up by a physical button.</p>

<h2>Galaxy S9 Modular Capabilities&nbsp;Rumours</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;d all love the option of customising our phones to meet our exact needs, right? So, the rumour that Samsung Galaxy S9 could feature &lsquo;modular capability&rsquo; is a welcome and exciting one.</p>
<p>Eldar Murtazin, a source who isn&rsquo;t always reliable, Tweeted (in Russian - you can translate it on Twitter) that the rumoured Galaxy S9 is likely to have modular capabilities. That means users would have the power to choose various elements of their phone &mdash; from speakers to specialist camera features, and more in between.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="ru">Galaxy S9 скорее всего получит аксессуары на магнитиках сзади. В чем-то идея схожая с MotoMods. Пока этот вариант не утвержден</p>
<p>&mdash; Eldar Murtazin (@eldarmurtazin) <a href="https://twitter.com/eldarmurtazin/status/898057352712249344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Murtazin himself admitted that this speculative Samsung Galaxy S9 feature is &lsquo;not approved&rsquo; yet, which means it&rsquo;s nothing more than a mere whisper right now. There&rsquo;s no doubt that many of us would love choosing and upgrading our phone&rsquo;s specs as and when required.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Design Rumours</h2>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t yet know <em>anything</em> about Samsung Galaxy S9&rsquo;s design, but there are a few rumours floating about. One interesting titbit out there relates to a glass coating that Samsung licensed in 2016.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMDRQy57MmE" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The technology is meant to make water literally bounce off phones, and could well mean that Samsung Galaxy S9 is more waterproof than ever before, better for using in the rain and around liquids.</p>
<p>So far as the overall look goes, we expect Samsung will keep it in line with Samsung Galaxy S8, opting for a premium, all-screen design.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Display&nbsp;Rumours</h2>
<p>One of the areas Samsung always excels in is the display. Time and time again, Samsung produces them in the highest quality, with fantastic detail and great colour reproduction.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.thebell.co.kr/front/free/contents/news/article_view.asp?key=201704050100006670000400&amp;svccode=04&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bell</a>, Samsung started working on Galaxy S9 display back in March 2017, which was around the same time that the Galaxy S8 launched. (No rest for the wicked!).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15591" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GwXyzM_X9M9xA9zGL7yH3xRVKpRsZKYvHt9-Zc4vQLCu6a3Qp6R0Mjr710-3sGhw0mfn5S7UM__ZrMoCbMqc78U=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>And what has Samsung been working on? Well, according to <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trusted Reviews</a>, Samsung is developing a new lamination process that could allow the Galaxy S9 to be curved on all four edges.</p>
<p>As for sizes, Trusted Reviews also goes on to claim that Samsung is gearing up for a 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch version.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 Release Date and Price Rumours</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there&rsquo;s no word yet on the Samsung Galaxy S9 release date or price. So, that means we&rsquo;ll have to look at history for help.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 &ndash; Reveal: March 29 | Release: April 21</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S7 &ndash; Reveal: February 21 | Release: March 11</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 &ndash; Reveal: March 1 | Release: April 10</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S5 &ndash; Reveal: February 24 | Release: April 11</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S4 &ndash; Reveal: March 14 | Release: April 27</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy s3 &ndash; Reveal: May 3 | Release: May 29</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S2 &ndash; Reveal: February 13 | Release: May 2</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S &ndash; Reveal: March | Release: June 4</p>
<p>Some rumours have suggested that Galaxy S9 could be out in January 2018, but that seems too soon. In recent years, Samsung&rsquo;s flagship devices have been announced in March, so we expect the next release date to be similar to that. What&rsquo;s more, the Samsung Galaxy S9 price is likely to be around &pound;600-&pound;700, based on the Galaxy S8 initial cost.</p>
