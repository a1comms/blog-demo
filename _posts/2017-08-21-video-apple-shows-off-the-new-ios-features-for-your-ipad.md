<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Get your eye in early for iOS 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lead-up to the release of Apple&rsquo;s latest operating system, the world is left wondering what the tech giant has in store for us this time. Of course, iOS 11 won&rsquo;t officially be released until this autumn, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re completely in the dark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh no, we now know more about the update than ever. That&rsquo;s because, last week, the good people at Apple decided to give fans a little treat in the form of six brand new videos, each of which show a sneak preview of how you can use iOS 11 on your iPad.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14656 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u7booAnYjtP9SaARnfsV0RrPgJPcs5zyxx97QRChpmrQTCX_KcsvzoyDZIEu4N6Mnm44MDfkJmYI163BfFAaPpE=s0" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short and sweet clips only last about a minute and each one focusses on a way that iOS 11 will change your iPad. Features include multitasking abilities, managing your files, and using the latest Dock system with ease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that&rsquo;s not all. Not by a long-shot. One of the clips include a tutorial on how you can use an Apple Pencil to sign and send documents; a cheeky little feature which is certain to make everyone&rsquo;s life easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to already have an iPad (or if you&rsquo;re thinking of getting one soon!), it&rsquo;s worth checking out each of the clips. They should give you a quick and snappy overview of how you can use each of the new features when they are released. So, you can really hit the ground running with iOS 11. Check out the videos here:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when can you get your hands on iOS 11? Well, the system is currently in beta (so that developers and the like can test it for themselves). However, the full, official version of the update will most likely be available in September. Not long to wait, guys! </span></p>
