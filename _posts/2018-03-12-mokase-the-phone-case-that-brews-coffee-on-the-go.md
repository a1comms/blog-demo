<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s like having a barista in your pocket!</span></p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get anything done until you&rsquo;ve had your morning cup of java, we&rsquo;ve got some buzzing news for you!</p>
<p>Soon enough, you won&rsquo;t need to run to your local cafe to grab a tall white on the way to work. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be able to simply open an app on your phone, click a button, and start brewing.</p>

<p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.mokase.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mokase</a> is the smartphone case that turns your device into a mini coffee machine. The future is finally here and it smells delicious. The Italian gadget will work much like any modern-day coffee machine. You pop a small pod (or ultra-thin filter in this case) into the side of it, press a button and wait for your coffee to pour out the side.</p>
<p>So, how does it work? Well, it pairs with an app that you&rsquo;ll need to download first which means that the whole thing is pretty much seamless. There&rsquo;s even a built-in heating system which warms up the drink so you get steaming hot coffee, while the case itself should stay cool.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s not as clunky as you might imagine. The Mokase team has done a pretty decent job of making the thing look a lot like any other standard case you might get.</p>
<p>The first few batches will be fit for both iPhone and Samsung devices. Oh, and they will come in two colours &ndash; white cream and black espresso (of course!).</p>

<p>But wait, we hear you cry, if you&rsquo;re out and about, where are you supposed to find a coffee cup? That&rsquo;s a good question, but one that you needn&rsquo;t worry yourself about. Luckily, the makers of the Mokase have already thought about that one.</p>
<p>The case comes with a cute little pop-up cup that can be used as a keyring. That means wherever you are and whatever you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;ll be able to stop for a quick espresso. Nice.</p>

<p>If this is the first you&rsquo;re hearing about the Mokase, you&rsquo;re not alone. The coffee-based gadget is still very, very new. In fact, it&rsquo;s not even out yet! It was originally launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mokase/mokase-your-mobile-phone-cover-makes-even-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter</a>, but became so popular so quickly, that its founders decided to cancel the campaign and skip ahead to the production stage.</p>
<p>That means that you can now pre-order one of the devices ahead of its June release for just under &euro;70 (around &pound;65).</p>
