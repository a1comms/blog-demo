<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Replacing an iPhone is expensive. Protecting it isn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p>iPhones. Long regarded as some of, if not, <em>the</em> most beautiful smartphones on the market.</p>
<p>But for all their beauty, they&rsquo;re extremely precious things. Because we now demand premium looking mobile phones, fashioned from quality materials like glass in favour of plastic, the risk of shattering both our displays, and our hearts, has never been higher.</p>
<p>For the luckless amongst us, it can take a single, ill-fated drop to transform an otherwise immaculate looking iPhone, into a mutilated monstrosity. These are very dangerous times we live in.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you&rsquo;ve the sense to invest in an iPhone case&hellip;</p>
<p>They come in different shapes and sizes, and suit a smorgasbord of tastes. We&rsquo;ve listed five of the best iPhone 6s cases from Amazon below, all of which fit an iPhone 6 too. Take a look, and seriously consider the investment, especially considering how affordable these are.</p>
<h2>1) Minimalist Anti-Scratch Clear Case by JETech</h2>
<p>A clear, minimalist design makes this one of the best iPhone 6s cases for anyone who can&rsquo;t face concealing the beauty of their iPhone, but still want to protect it as best they can.</p>
<p>Made from PC and TPU, it offers sound, shock absorbing protection to the rear, and around the edges of your iPhone, designed to endure the worst of any drop, bump or scratch.</p>
<p>Cut-outs for your camera lens, buttons and ports mean you have full functionality of your iPhone when the case is on. And the slim design takes nothing away from your iPhone&rsquo;s slender build. It still slips into your pocket comfortably.</p>

<h2>2) Slim and Light Protective Case by Anker</h2>
<p>Likewise, this is amongst the slimmest cases available, adding just a fraction of thickness to your iPhone 6 or 6s, and just an ounce to the weight. You&rsquo;ll barely notice the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fashioned from durable TPU and anti-stretch thermoplastic, which guards it from the usual dangers, like accidental drops and contact with notoriously pesky objects like keys.</p>
<p>The design is elegantly understated, similar to Apple&rsquo;s official iPhone 6 and 6s offering. The volume rockers and power button are covered, but accessible through the case&rsquo;s pressure-sensitive sides. The silent switch, ports and camera are exposed, though the latter is shielded by an anti-glare camera guard.</p>

<h2>3) Premium Leather Flip Case by Torro</h2>
<p>By far my favourite on our list of the best iPhone 6s cases, is this tidy little number from Torro. I&rsquo;ve been using one since the launch of iPhone 6 back in 2014, and it&rsquo;s without a doubt the best case I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>
<p>Made from genuine leather, it certainly looks and feels the part. And over time, it ages beautifully, like a fine wine, or Dame Helen Mirren. But aside from the premium appearance, and obvious protection benefits, its best feature is the trio of card slots located on the inside cover.</p>
<p>With room for three of your cards, and a separate pouch for cash, there&rsquo;s absolutely no need to carry a wallet; I haven&rsquo;t for almost 18 months. And thanks to some cleverly concealed magnetic closures, the cover doesn&rsquo;t risk flapping open and exposing your phone screen or cards.</p>

<h2>4) Rugged Armor Capsule Case by Spigen</h2>
<p>Emerging as the toughest of the bunch, this case provides superb protection from drops and impacts, whilst simultaneously offering a very rugged and industrial appearance. The ultimate iPhone 6 case for the man&rsquo;s man?</p>
<p>The carbon fibre textures, glossy accents and matte finish or lend themselves to the hard-man appearance, and the air cushion design helps absorb the shock of any impact.</p>
<p>Like the slim, lightweight case from Anker above, the main buttons are shielded behind the protective layer of the case, bar the silent switch and ports. It might not be for everyone, but this case certainly has an edge about it.</p>

<h2>5) Bumper and Anti-Scratch Clear Case by JETech</h2>
<p>Even more popular than JETech&rsquo;s entirely transparent iPhone 6s case, is this one with a wraparound bumper, giving it added shock-absorption and a better grip.</p>
<p>Yes, the bumper does obscure the edges of your iPhone, but I think it looks pretty neat framed in this case. The front and rear are still visible, and the scratch-resistant back cover keeps potential scratches at bay. The edges of the case reach around to the front of your iPhone to minimise the risk of smashing the display if dropped.</p>
<p>I had the same case for my iPhone 5s a few years ago, and it served me perfectly well.</p>
