<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This trick works for iPhone and Android.</span></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re listening to a fascinating TED talk or your favourite tune on YouTube, there&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than the fact you can&rsquo;t keep playing it in the background, while you do something else on your phone. It&rsquo;s a first-world problem, if ever there was one.</p>
<p>Of course, our lives would be so much better if we could carry on listening to the joys of YouTube, without interruption. Well, now we can. Some clever little sausage has worked out how you can listen to YouTube in the background, while doing whatever you want on your Android or iOS device. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>How to Use Your iPhone While Listening to YouTube</h2>
<p>Before you do anything, you&rsquo;ll need to download the free <a href="http://dolphin.com">Dolphin</a> browser for your iPhone. We know it&rsquo;s extra hassle, but it&rsquo;s the only way&hellip; Once you have it, you&rsquo;ll be able to set your iPhone up for using it while listening to whatever you please on YouTube. Just follow these three, simple steps.</p>
<p>1) Open the browser and head to www.youtube.com.</p>
<p>2) Find a video you want to listen to.</p>
<p>3) Use the Home button to minimise the browser.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that despite closing the Dolphin browser, YouTube keeps playing in the background. What&rsquo;s more, if you open the control panel by swiping up, you can control playback there too.</p>

<h2>How to Use Your Android While Listening to YouTube</h2>
<p>On Android mobile phones, it&rsquo;s actually a little easier to enable background YouTube audio. You won&rsquo;t need to download anything extra. Just follow these&hellip;</p>
<p>1) Open the browser and head to www.youtube.com.</p>
<p>2) Press the three-dot menu button in the right of the screen.</p>
<p>3) Select <em>Request desktop site</em>.</p>
<p>4) Find a video you want to listen to.</p>
<p>5) Leave the Chrome app in the background.</p>
<p>Now, you should be able to do whatever you please on your phone. The music, or whatever you&rsquo;re listening to, will continue playing in the background. Now that you&rsquo;ve got the inside scoop on this, it&rsquo;s time to get on with more pressing things, like choosing what song you want to listen to next.</p>
