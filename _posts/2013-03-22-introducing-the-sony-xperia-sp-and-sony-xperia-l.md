<p><span class="postStandFirst">Not just content with producing the fantastic Xperia Z flagship, Sony have created two new phones to accommodate all budgets. Meet the&nbsp;Sony Xperia SP and Sony Xperia L.</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia L</a>&nbsp;is a mid-range handset that packs some great hardware for its category, sporting an eight megapixel camera with HDR, face detection and sweep panorama, NFC, Android Jellybean 4.1 and a dual-core processor.</p>
<p>Never one to compromise on the design of its products the Xperia L is a beautifully crafted handset with some very unique attributes, the most predominant one being an ambient light which acts as an alert for calls, messages and even flashes in sync with your music.</p>
<p>The device looks great and is extremely well-balanced, offering premium features for a handset in its category.</p>
<p>Announced alongside its little brother, the Xperia SP is Sony's latest mid-range offering, and comes armed with a full spec sheet and stunning design to boot.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Sony Xperia SP&nbsp;packs a 4.6 inch 720p HD display, a powerful 1.7GHz dual-core processor, the Android Jellybean 4.1 operating system and an eight megapixel camera.</p>
<p>Housed in an aluminium frame, with its Mobile Bravia2 Engine-powered screen, the Xperia SP is beautifully crafted and includes a full range of connectivity options including NFC and 4G LTE, as well as the usual Sony extras such as Playstation-certification, Sony WALKMAN and Sony Entertainment network.</p>
<p>As with the Xperia L, the Xperia SP houses an ambient light which is found in the transparent antenna at the base of the phone and it comes complete with customisable options allowing you to add a bit of personal flair to your device.</p>
<p><strong>Both smartphones offer some serious bang for your buck, so whatever your budget Sony has it covered with both the Xperia SP and Xperia L.</strong></p>
