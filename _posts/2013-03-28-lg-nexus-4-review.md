<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Google Nexus 4 smartphone is at the forefront of cutting-edge mobile technology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4668 aligncenter" alt="Nexus 4 Review" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Nexus-4.png" width="670" height="400" /></p>
<p>The Nexus range of products by Google have always been at the forefront of technology.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus, released in 2011, introduced us to the world of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and Android Beam; the Nexus 7 tablet brought quad-core power to the mobile market, and it is the turn of the&nbsp;Google Nexus 4&nbsp;by LG.</p>
<p>Powered by a Snapdragon 1.5GHz quad-core cpu and 2GB of RAM and, with the latest incarnation of Android Jelly Bean 4.2 on board, the Nexus 4 speeds through tasks, apps and games without breaking into a sweat.</p>
<p>The device has a 4.7-inch True HD Plus IPS display with a pixel density of 320ppi, meaning that the images on the Nexus 4 are clear and crisp with excellent viewing angles and vibrant colours. The handset also comes with 16GB on board memory and features a 2100mAh in-built battery, meaning there is plenty of space for apps, pictures and music and enough power to keep you playing all day long.</p>
<p>The design of the LG Nexus 4 is stunningly simple. The front is almost featureless, with no visible front keys and slightly curved edges making edge-to-edge scrolling a breeze. The back of the device however is a complete contrast with an almost 3D-like pattern embedded into the glass, adding a little flair to the mix. The bezel of the phone is slightly rubberised which adds extra grip on the nearly all glass body.</p>
<p>Google has included new wireless charging technology in the Nexus 4 which, like the Nokia Lumia 920, allows you to place the device down on a compatible charging plate or mat and negates the need for a plug-in charger. Google's wireless trend continues with the inclusion of NFC and have several of Google&rsquo;s cloud services, such as the newly revamped Google Music which allows you to store up to 20,000 tracks for free.</p>
<p>One of the most talked about features of the Nexus 4 is the PhotoSphere camera function which allows the user to take full 3D spherical pictures, using the 8 megapixel camera, and creates a fully immersive image of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Google-owned Android 4.2 Jelly Bean brings in many new features to the platform, including the improved Google Now, Android Beam, a fantastic Swype keyboard and brand new lock screen widgets.</p>
<p><strong>Overall the LG Nexus 4 is an amazing device, great looking and with some fantastic stand-out features.</strong></p>
