<p><span class="postStandFirst">Now that the big three smartphone platforms in the UK (Android, iOS and Windows Phone) all have their own virtual assistants, it&rsquo;s time for us to put them through their paces. Join us as we look at the strengths of all three, and see what future additions might make them all perfect, before asking the big question: which one is best?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With Android and iOS both having their own virtual assistants, it was only a matter of time until Windows Phone joined the party, and got its own voice-controlled assistant. She&rsquo;s called Cortana, and everything we&rsquo;ve seen so far indicates that she&rsquo;s rather brilliant.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a bit of a quandary, because we get lots of questions like: which one is the best? Is Google Now the greatest? Is Cortana the coolest? Or is Siri superior over the rest?&nbsp;(I wonder if I could squeeze any more alliterative adjectives in before the article&rsquo;s finishedI finish this article...)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way to find out: take the LG G3 (with Google Now on it), the iPhone 5s (with Siri), and the swanky new Nokia Lumia 930 (with Cortana), put them in a cage, and see which one comes out victorious!</p>
<h2>Siri</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4845" alt="Siri" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/siri-mic.jpg" width="280" height="280" /></p>
<p>Siri has the distinction of being the <i>first</i> virtual assistant fully baked into a major smartphone operating system, and what has always been cool about Siri is how much the assistant will answer back, if you ask it questions that are a little, shall we say, outside the norm. There are whole pages on the net devoted to the sassy, sometimes sarcastic, responses that Siri comes out with, and that does tend to imbue her with a whole lot of personality.</p>
<p>However, there are some things Siri can&rsquo;t do. The most notable characteristic to not feature is a predictive notifications function (i.e. learning your routine, then telling you if things could disrupt it, such as if traffic&rsquo;s bad on your normal commute). We&rsquo;ve heard rumours that will be coming in future, and frankly it can&rsquo;t come soon enough, as that&rsquo;s one of the big features that make Siri&rsquo;s rivals so good.</p>
<h2>Google Now</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4844" alt="Google now" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/OK-google-cover_w_500.png" width="350" height="264" /></p>
<p>On that note, it&rsquo;s time to grab hold of the LG G3, and put Google Now through its paces. Straight away we notice a difference, because whereas Siri is summoned with a button press, you can summon Google Now just by saying &ldquo;<i>OK Google</i>&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a nice little touch, and it does make for a more hands-free experience.</p>
<p>Google Now is also supremely adept at the kind of predictive notifications that Siri can&rsquo;t yet handle. So, as a virtual assistant, Google Now is arguably more useful than Siri, as it can <i>do</i> more. However, it has to be said that it has nowhere near as much personality as its Apple rival, as it doesn&rsquo;t come with the sassy responses that you get from Siri, and that&rsquo;s one feature we really hope Google will be adding in the future.</p>
<h2>Cortana</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4774" alt="Hi, I'm Cortana." src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Hi-Im-Cortana..jpg" width="564" height="312" /></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the newest of these three virtual assistants, Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana, and that leaves us with <i>another</i> quandary. Specifically, the issue is this: Cortana in the UK is <i>not</i> the same as Cortana in the USA.</p>
<p>Sure, both versions offer both predictive and <i>event-based</i> (e.g. &ldquo;when your sister rings, wish her happy birthday&rdquo;) notifications, but the British version does <i>not</i> have Cortana&rsquo;s actual voice (in the USA, the virtual assistant is voiced by Jen Taylor, the voice of Cortana in the HALO games), nor does it have the same witty responses.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we would assume that the personality will return (and there&rsquo;s talk online of the UK versions already getting a slew of more witty responses), but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Cortana in the UK <i>does not sound like Cortana</i>.</p>
<p>So, while we don&rsquo;t know this will happen, we <i>really</i> hope that Microsoft will make a voice pack for us UK users, to give Cortana her <i>real</i> voice.</p>
<p>Do that, and Cortana could end up being pretty much perfect...</p>
<h2>Which is the best?</h2>
<p><strong>This is a subjective question, really, but if we had to pick one as the real stand-out, it would have to be the <i>original USA version</i> of Cortana. She has more personality than Siri, is more powerful than Google Now, and using Cortana makes you feel like you&rsquo;re interacting with a <i>real</i> person (notice how we call her &ldquo;she&rdquo;). The UK version lacks that, but if Microsoft can fix the omissions, she could end up being the best virtual assistant on the UK market!</strong></p>
