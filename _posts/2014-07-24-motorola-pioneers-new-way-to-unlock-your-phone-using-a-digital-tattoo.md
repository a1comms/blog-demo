<p><span class="postStandFirst">A creative and rather interesting new way to unlock your phone (assuming your phone is a Moto X) has been unveiled after the collaboration and partnership of Motorola and VivaLnk. It&rsquo;s called the Digital Tattoo, and it takes the form of a temporary, stick-on, <i>NFC-enabled</i> tattoo. It&rsquo;s a very cool concept, but it remains to be seen whether the idea will stick with any permanence or not, just like a real tattoo&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how many ways there now are to do something that&rsquo;s ostensibly such a tiny part of the smartphone experience, namely unlocking your phone. There are passcodes, unlock patterns, knock codes, fingerprint scanners, and now there&rsquo;s one more to add to the list, and it's perhaps the most abstract so far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of technology made by a company called VivaLnk, which is being pushed by Motorola, and it&rsquo;s called the Digital Tattoo.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this new technology involves putting a temporary, stick-on tattoo somewhere on yourself (the <i>logical</i> place being on you wrist, but we&rsquo;d imagine it can be stuck on anywhere), but the clever bit is that the tattoo is <i>NFC-enabled</i>. Thus, unlocking your Moto X becomes a simple mater of tapping against your wrist, or wherever you stuck on the tattoo, and <i>voil&agrave;</i>: one unlocked phone.</p>
<p>We have to admit that seeing our phones come to life just by tapping them against our wrists is, well, <i>very</i> cool indeed, so we&rsquo;d like to see it supporting other phones beyond just the Moto X (the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the magnificent LG G3 spring to mind).</p>
<p>One potential downside, however, is the cost: a pack of ten Digital Tattoos will cost in the region of ten dollars (the <i>other</i> downside is indicated by the price; it seems to be only available in the USA, at the moment), so it&rsquo;s an extra expense which might not be justifiable to some people, especially as each tattoo will only last 5 days. Costs could conceivably mount up to a fair amount over a year.</p>
<p><strong>At the moment, Digital Tattoo is only usable with the Moto X, but if or when it comes to other smartphones, we could see it finding a niche for itself. Stay tuned for more news!&nbsp;</strong></p>
