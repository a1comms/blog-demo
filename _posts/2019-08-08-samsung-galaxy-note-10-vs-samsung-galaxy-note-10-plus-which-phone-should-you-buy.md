<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fancy a brand new Note series phone? This week, the good people over at Samsung announced not one but two new devices. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and the Note 10 Plus could be serious game-changers. So, which should you choose?</p>

<h2>Flawless Design</h2>
<p>You might feel like you&rsquo;re seeing double when you look at the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> and the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-plus-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note 10 Plus</a>. These two phones are nearly identical &ndash;&nbsp;both with a flawless and almost bezeless design. Each comes with a Gorilla Glass 6 casing and metal frames.</p>
<p>Flip the devices over to the front and you will see the camera that all the hype was about. Yes, the selfie cam sits neatly at the top of each screen, with a hole-punch style look.</p>
<p>Of course, the main difference you will notice between these two devices is the size. As the name denotes, the Plus model is slightly larger than the standard phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an array of colour options here. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is available in Aura Glow and Aura Black. On the other hand, the Plus model comes in Aura Glow and Aura Black.</p>
<h2>Endless Displays</h2>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s talk about the displays. As we have already mentioned, each of the phones comes with that signature hole-punch camera in the front. These sit inside the Dynamic AMOLED Infinity-O displays that look simply endless thanks to the lack of bezels here.</p>
<p>The standard Note 10 model comes with a 6.3-inch display offering boasting 2,280 x 1,080 resolution. However, the Note 10 Plus kicks things up a notch with a massive 6.8-inch display and 3,040 x 1,440 resolution. Since the two devices are quite similar in many other ways, this difference is most certainly notable and users will notice it immediately.</p>

<h2>Ultra Powerful Machines</h2>
<p>But what about under the hood? We&rsquo;re glad you asked.</p>
<p>Both the devices come with the snazzy <span class="spec-copy">Exynos 9825 </span>chipset. The Note 10 device packs a neat 8GB RAM while the Note 10 Plus model takes things further with a 12GB RAM. That means that either of these latest Note series phones are certain to be ultra powerful machines.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed here at all. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 comes with a 3500 mAh battery pack and the Plus model has 4300 mAh too. There&rsquo;s also a Super Fast Charging feature on both of these devices. That means that you can juice up in just 30 minutes and get enough power to last you all day long.</p>
<h2>Killer Photography Setups</h2>
<p>Fancy having pro-grade photography equipment in your pocket? That&rsquo;s what the two Note series phones promise.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Note 10</a> sports two 12-megapixel wide and telephoto shooters and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens on the rear. As for the selfie camera, that&rsquo;s a nice 10-megapixel offering, which is sure to please most users.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-plus-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note 10 Plus</a> variant takes things to a whole new level when it comes to the camera. The device has the same 12-megapixel wide and telephoto shooters plus the 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens on the rear, but there&rsquo;s one helpful addition. There&rsquo;s also a time-of-flight sensor on the back that will help to take awesome 3D-style images. The selfie setup is the same with the 10-megapixel lens that you get on the entry Note 10 model.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t end there. Samsung has added some astonishing features to their videos too.</p>
<p>You can now use the Bokeh Effect when filming, which means that you can neatly blur out the background and make a cool-looking video. There&rsquo;s also a new motion feature that should mean your videos look smoother and steadier than ever before. Yes, please.</p>
<h2>Remarkable Extra Features</h2>
<p>Have we mentioned the S-Pens yet? These styluses are what makes the Note series phones unique.</p>
<p>With the Note 10 devices, Samsung promises the &lsquo;most advanced S-Pen yet&rsquo;. With a long battery life, gesture and Bluetooth enabled features, it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_21131" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-21131 size-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2019/08/galaxy-note10-s-pen-edit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="347"> S Pen.[/caption]</p>
<p>The pen can be used as a remote control for both the Galaxy Note 10 and the Note 10 Plus. You can use it to pause videos, music, and even snap a quick picture. Now, you can also use &lsquo;air actions&rsquo; to get your phone to do certain things. For example, if you move your pen clockwise, you can change the angle of the camera before you take a shot.</p>
<p>Plus, you can turn your handwriting into text on your phone screen in an instant. That means that taking a few quick notes has never been easier. You don&rsquo;t need to open an app to get started with this feature. You can simply start using your S-Pen on the screen.</p>
<h2>Price and Summary</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the down low on each Note series phone, the question remains the same. Which should you buy?</p>
<p>The price may help you to make that decision. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is available for pre-order now at &pound;869. However, if you would like the Plus model, that price goes up to &pound;999. There&rsquo;s not much in it.</p>
<p>Deciding which phone is right for you basically comes down to size. If you would prefer a phablet-style device then you will want to go for the Plus model. Despite this, most people should find that the entry-level Galaxy Note 10 has enough size and features for them.</p>
