<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Sound by Human's headphones render your Spanish lessons completely pointless&hellip;</span></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I didn&rsquo;t pay all that much attention in language classes. I can muster a meek &lsquo;hola&rsquo;, and the occasional &lsquo;omelette du fromage&rsquo; when required, but that&rsquo;s where my stunning linguistic skills come to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, we just don&rsquo;t value languages like we ought to. To put it very, very bluntly, we&rsquo;re lazy and generally expect the others&nbsp;to make the effort by learning to speak&nbsp;English.</p>
<p>Still, imagine a world where we didn&rsquo;t have to learn how to understand each other; where we could simply pop on a pair of headphones and have them translate languages in real-time. It sounds rather far-fetched, but that is exactly what the Sound by Human headphones claim to do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11818" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Sound-by-Human-Translate.gif" alt="sound-by-human-translate" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>As the folks at Human put it, &ldquo;Sound is more than a headphone &ndash; it&rsquo;s the future of how you connect with the people and experiences that matter most. Sound breaks language barriers during both travel and business.&rdquo; Okay, so what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>Well, the headphones will boast a range of features. In fact, there&rsquo;s not one but six different modes from which to choose. The &lsquo;Speak&rsquo; mode is by far the most impressive since that&rsquo;s the one that claims to translate speech word by word. At the moment, there are eight languages available, more will doubtless be added should the gadget be a success.</p>

<p>Other than the fancy translation feature, there are five other modes. The &lsquo;Social&rsquo; mode allows you to connect with other Sound by Human users and listen in on the same audio. The &lsquo;Amplify&rsquo; mode means that you can take the headphones off and essentially turn them into two mini (yet powerful) speakers.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Active&rsquo; mode is much like fitness watches in that it monitors your biometric stats and checks up on your general health. And then, when you head to bed, &lsquo;Sleep&rsquo; monitors your circadian rhythms to make sure that you&rsquo;re getting the optimum level of rest. So far, so enticing.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the final mode is slightly less impressive than the ones already covered. &lsquo;Fade&rsquo; allows you to change the volume of different sound streams. You can turn down your music while you&rsquo;re out walking, or &lsquo;fade&rsquo; your podcast into the background when you&rsquo;re at work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how that one counts as a mode either.</p>
<p>Sadly, you can&rsquo;t just walk into a shop and pick up a pair of these. Not just yet anyway. Sound by Human is still very much in the developmental stage, and the company is&nbsp;asking for crowdfunding backers on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sound-world-s-most-comfortable-smart-headphones-music-audio#/" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>.</p>

<p>Those who choose to donate early will be privy to the first release of the headphones and some BETA apps that they can test ahead of time. The estimated initial launch is set for July 2017, but it&rsquo;s not clear when the headphones will be readily available in shops. If you&rsquo;re hoping to get your hands on a pair, it&rsquo;s worth following Human&rsquo;s progress online or even donating now so that you&rsquo;ll be on the waiting list when they finally launch.</p>
