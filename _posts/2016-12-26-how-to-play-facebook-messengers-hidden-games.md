<p>An app that's built around talking to friends suddenly runs out of uses when the conversation dies down, doesn't it? Well, not Messenger, because it's full of hidden bonus games that are totally awesome.</p>
<p>From old school arcade offerings (oh, hello, PAC-MAN) to addictive modern games (a la Cooking Mama), there are loads to choose from. What&rsquo;s more, is you actually play these head-to-head with your mates. And yes, they can get very competitive.</p>
<h2>Messenger's Hidden Trove of Games</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably wondering how to play Messenger's games, right? Well, it&rsquo;s actually ridiculously simple. First of all, you absolutely have to make sure that you have the most recent version of the app.</p>
<p>Then, open a chat with one of your friends, or even a group of friends. You should see a small game controller icon above your keyboard. Tap it, and the screen will generate a <em>long </em>list of games that you can play right away. It&rsquo;s honestly worth spending a little time checking them, because there really is something for everyone, including quizzes and retro platform games.</p>

<h2>Our Top 3 Messenger Must-Play Games</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know where to start, never fear. Here are three Messenger games that we love and you have to try. You won't regret it.</p>
<p><strong>Trivia Blast Ultimate </strong></p>
<p>This Messenger game is made for the trivia nerds. If your general knowledge is A+, you'll love nothing more than showing it off in front of your friends time and time again, challenging them to beat your score. Once you start, you have ten seconds to answer each question. If you get three wrong, it&rsquo;s game over!</p>
<p><strong>Galaga </strong></p>
<p>If you absolutely love retro gaming, the fact that you can play both Galaga and Space Invaders on Messenger is certain to delight you. Both games are very similar to the original arcade versions, so you&rsquo;re in for some old-school entertainment! Challenge your pals to beat your high score.</p>
<p><strong>Endless Lake </strong></p>
<p>You'll both love and hate Endless Lake. The basic idea of the game is simple and won't take long to grasp. Your character walks along a bridge (over an endless lake) and has to jump each time a gap appears in it. The concept couldn't be more straightforward, and yet it doesn't quite work out that way&hellip; It's ridiculously addictive and extremely frustrating. Good luck!</p>
