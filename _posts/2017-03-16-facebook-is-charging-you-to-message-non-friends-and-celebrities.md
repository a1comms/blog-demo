<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Despite the hoax messages doing the rounds on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>One of the greatest things about Facebook is that it connects us with a whole bunch of people around the globe. Some, like our mum and our besties, are people we genuinely know, but that&rsquo;s not all we use the site for. Oh no!</p>
<p>As many of us already know, Facebook can be used to reach out to just about anyone &mdash; be they friend, foe, or, indeed, celebrity.</p>
<p>It might pain you to know, then, that reports are circulating Facebook, claiming that the social network is introducing charges for using the service.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13462" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/biy6Yx8AP_wcvtPcpWZzJVFR_KFJiyPRd3GoeXJZbWCiFq2-cOnlyjDQg9Jy1xY8lWiDyCbbPXVSUysURI9ZBvZM=s0" width="600" height="448" /></p>
<p>With more than 1 billion users, this move could turn a handsome profit for Facebook. Except that it's not true.</p>
<p>The messages doing the rounds on Facebook (picture below) appear to be a hoax. One reads: "From Saturday morning Facebook will become chargeable. If you have at least 10 contacts send them this message. In this way we will see that you are an avid user and your logo will become blue and will remain free.</p>
<p>"As discussed in the paper today. Facebook will cost 0.01ps per message. Send this message to 10 people. When you do the light will turn blue otherwise Facebook will activate billing."</p>

<p>By sharing the Facebook hoax, you won't have put yourself in any danger, but you might have wasted your time. As with the similar false claims&nbsp;that WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) is planning to start charging users.</p>
<p>What can you do to avoid being duped by such claims in the future? Rather than sharing first and asking questions later, have a look around the web first, for announcements from reputable sources that either back up or debunk any sensational assertions. With so much 'fake news' reportedly circulating the internet these days, you can never be too cautious!</p>
