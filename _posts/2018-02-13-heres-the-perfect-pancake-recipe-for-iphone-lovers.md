<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We&rsquo;re not talking about apples&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Happy Pancake Day! Yes, that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s every sweet-toothed, pancake-gorging person&rsquo;s favourite day of the year.</p>
<p>So, you have the perfect excuse to fill your face with all the warm, tasty goodness you can handle. If you failed to start the morning today with a tasty batch of pancakes, there&rsquo;s still time to turn the day around and get things back on track.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to stick to the old faithful &ndash; plain pancakes with lemon and sugar. Oh no, there are plenty of ways in which you can spice things up (literally, if you try some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl5OFosjNZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spicy potato pancakes</a>!) and up your breakfast-making game.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16610" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rMQ4oFM9mKYpTPpBIBsildC5QOil3iVkYCdr1o6qiYhXaZKRJUG6GtMGd9xMdVVVZ_UglOsYo26VTS0ek4EA4okNdw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>From delectably over-the-top creations to a new take on the standard pancake look, you may just be spoiled for choice. But wait, how can you find the perfect pancake for you?</p>
<p>Well, if you happen to be a real Apple nerd, we may have just the thing for you. Fancy guzzling down a tasty treat complete with the familiar logo on it? Of course, you do. Luckily, the internet has a tutorial for just about everything that you could ever imagine.</p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that there is an Apple-themed pancake video out there.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmzmdO5n-Xk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCa0BnCIDBGzmw4daUGZ0yg">TigerTomato</a>, a YouTube channel famed for creating some of the weirdest and wildest pancakes you will ever have the pleasure of seeing, have just the thing. In a short but oh-so-sweet video, the guys behind the channel show us how to make a square pancake, adorned with a ridiculously neat Apple logo.</p>
<p>Why not take things to a whole new level and try it for yourself? Be warned, though, as making it takes a whole <em>lot </em>of skill and a really steady hand. If you&rsquo;d like to try the recipe at home, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small funnel/bottle</li>
<li>Pancake batter</li>
<li>Black food colouring</li>
</ul>
<p>The pancake masters start off drawing an inverted outline of the Apple logo with black batter. Once the outline is complete, they fill in the logo and let the batter start to cook.</p>
<p>Next, using plain, white batter, they begin to draw a box around the logo, complete with curved edges just like an app thumbnail and fill that in too.</p>
<p>Finally, after just a few seconds, they flip the pancake to reveal a beautifully flawless Apple logo in the middle of a square shape. You have to see the result for yourself; it&rsquo;s simply mind-boggling.</p>
<p>While creating something as geekily-good as this pancake may take a few attempts (no, really&hellip;), it&rsquo;s totally worth trying. Just think of all the kudos you&rsquo;d get on Instagram if you posted a snap of this. So. Many. Likes.</p>
<p>Oh, and if the Apple pancake isn&rsquo;t for you, don&rsquo;t panic. The same channel has a load of other designs you could tackle from the YouTube logo to Elsa from Frozen. Go ahead and browse their collection so you can try something truly radical on this sugary sweet day. Enjoy!</p>
