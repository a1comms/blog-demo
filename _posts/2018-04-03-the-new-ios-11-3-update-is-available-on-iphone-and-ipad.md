<p>Apple has recently unleashed a new &lsquo;major&rsquo; update to its iPhone and iPad operating system, bringing &lsquo;new AR experiences, Animoji, health records and more&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve yet to get on board and update your iPhone or iPad, here&rsquo;s what you need to know about iOS 11.3, and how to download it for free.</p>
<h2>Better Battery Health Info</h2>

<p>Spoiler: There may come a time when your iPhone battery needs servicing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about how fast your juice is draining, iOS 11.3 can help you figure out what the problem is.</p>
<p>Once updated, head to Services > Battery to check out how healthy your battery is. (Note: This will only work on iPhone 6 and later models)</p>
<h2>Improved AR Experiences</h2>
<p>AR is very much the future. Luckily, Apple is on top of this particular tech trend.</p>
<p>The latest version of iOS includes some new and improved AR experiences with &lsquo;advanced computer vision techniques.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Apple says that AR will work better with 2D things (like walls, signs, and posters!) than ever before. That could mean some exciting new things in the future, such as interactive adverts, or even museum exhibits. Watch this space!</p>
<h2>New Data and Privacy Information</h2>

<p>If you have any concerns about your information, this is most certainly the place to go.</p>
<h2>More Animoji for iPhone X</h2>

<p>iOS 11.3 brings you four new Animoji expressions, including a lion, dragon, bear and even a skull. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, you can even sing karaoke using the voices of the Animoji that you choose. Nice.</p>
