<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s some great news for Apple lovers!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next year could be a rather exciting one for Apple fans. Yes, a 5G iPhone could be on the horizon as soon as 2020 dawns. This comes after the brand had some issues trying to find the right modem manufacturers for the rumoured iPhone gen.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Luckily, according to the latest speculation, the supposed problems may have been resolved and the 5G iPhone project could be going full-steam ahead. That means that we can pencil in the launch of these all-singing, all-dancing devices, which will be leading the way for super-duper-fast mobile internet. Here are the theories we&rsquo;ve heard so far surrounding this news.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Intel Quits Making 5G Modems</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before now, rumour had it that Intel would be supplying Apple with the 5G modems for the new iPhone models. The two brands had begun working on the idea and development was supposedly well underway.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In fact, one report from Mac Rumors suggests that Intel was previously working on a snazzy sounding XMM 8160 5G chip, which would power the next generation of mobile connectivity for Apple.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But there was trouble ahead! Problems started to arise when the people at Intel missed developmental deadlines for the new modem. That spurred rumours that there was an underlying issue with the process. Then, in a surprising turn of events, Intel stated that it will no longer be making the modems at all. Instead, the company would be ditching the 5G game altogether.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you might imagine, that was a real blow for the folk over at Apple HQ as it meant that they had to find a totally new supplier. Of course, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that since 5G technology is all new and shiney, not many companies are working with it yet. Finding the right business to buddy-up with was quite the conundrum.</p>

<h2>Qualcomm Look Set to Supply New 5G Modems</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the only other tech businesses to be working on 5G modems was the well-known name, Qualcomm. However, Apple has been caught up in a legal battle with this company in recent times, which made things rather tricky. Thankfully, at the start of April 2019, the two super companies saw eye-to-eye and settled their differences.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&ldquo;The settlement includes a payment from Apple to Qualcomm. The companies also reached a six-year license agreement, effective as of April 1, 2019, including a two-year option to extend, and a multiyear chipset supply agreement,&rdquo; says an official statement from Apple on the company&rsquo;s news site.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Experts now believe that Qualcomm will be supplying the 5G modems for 2020&rsquo;s line of iPhone models, according to a report by Mac Rumors. That would be good timing as the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-announces-the-cities-that-will-get-5g-next-year">5G network is ready to go live across areas of the UK this year</a>. While Apple has yet to confirm any of these theories, all of the signs look good ahead!</p>
