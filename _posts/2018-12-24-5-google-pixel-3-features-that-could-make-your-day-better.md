<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Just after a simple life? Google Pixel 3 has got your back.</span></p>
<p>Modern life is complicated at the best of times. If you&rsquo;re struggling to keep your work-life balance in check, technology could <em>actually</em> be the answer.</p>
<p>Google Pixel 3 has a whole range of neat features and tricks that will help make your everyday existence just a little bit easier. Here&rsquo;s how to use them to streamline your life.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKSA_idPZkc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>1) Compose Emails Like a Boss</h2>
<p>Do you feel as though the majority of your working day is spent writing emails? We hear you!</p>
<p>Luckily, Google Pixel 3 has something that can help you waste less time writing messages and more time getting stuff done. Gmail&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Compose</a> is a smart feature that guesses what phrases and words you&rsquo;re going to use in your emails. Easy.</p>
<h2>2) Find Things Quicker with Google Lens</h2>
<p>Searching has never been quicker. With Google Lens, you simply point your camera at an object, and the Google Pixel device does the rest.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiIE5GsiVWQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The feature can recognise more than a billion different things, according to a <a href="https://www.blog.google/perspectives/aparna-chennapragada/google-lens-one-year/">blog post</a> by the company. What&rsquo;s more, it also has an optical character recognition engine, which means that it can read text too.</p>
<p>Picture the scenario. You&rsquo;re in some fancy high-street shop looking for some new threads when you see some jeans that catch your eye. All you need to do is snap a picture with Google Lens and search. You can see whether there are similar (or even the same!) jeans online for a more affordable price. Perfect.</p>
<h2>3) Avoid Unwanted Calls</h2>
<p>Sick and tired of getting nonsense calls? Here&rsquo;s one of the best hacks to help you streamline your life.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call Screening</a> feature on the Google Pixel 3 allows you to hear who is on the other end of the line before actually answering.</p>
<p>Tap the Screen Call button and Google will answer the phone for you and let the person know you&rsquo;re using the screening feature. You can then see if the call is actually worth your time.</p>
<h2>4) Get Help from Google Assistant</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in a rush or just too busy to type, Google Assistant has your back. As far as AI features go, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this one.</p>
<p>Not only can you search for what you need, but the feature also syncs with a range of applications on your phone to give you a better, more in-depth experience.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPfQMVf4vwQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>For example, you can use it to order food through Just Eat (yes, please!), check your train times on the Trainline, or play a certain tune on Spotify.</p>
<p>All the above means that the feature is more like a real-life assistant than ever before. You simply have to say &lsquo;Hey Google&rsquo; and tell it what you need.</p>
<h2>5) Connect Your Home</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKYABI-dGEA" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on your way to having a smart home, this final tip is for you. You can use Google Assistant on your Google Pixel device to control certain smart home devices.</p>
<p>Gadgets you can use include Philips Hue smart lights, Nest, and Chromecast. You can set these features up by using Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7540702">guide</a>. Once you&rsquo;re done, you can control handy things (like the heating!) when you&rsquo;re not at home! Hello, warm house the moment you get in.</p>
