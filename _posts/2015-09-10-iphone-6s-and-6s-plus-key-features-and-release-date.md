<p><span class="postStandFirst">iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus &ndash; the only thing that&rsquo;s changed is everything.</span></p>
<p>The dust has hardly begun to settle on the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, San Francisco, where Tim Cook and his band of merry men unveiled the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, amongst some other less smartphone-<em>y</em> things.</p>
<p>Yet, already the Internet is in complete meltdown over these two devices, with <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a> still dominating the Twitter trends list. That&rsquo;s simply the effect Apple&rsquo;s iPhone events have on us. Why? Aside from the theatrical build up and spell-binding keynotes, Apple&rsquo;s iPhones are just so desirable.</p>
<p>The story&rsquo;s no different this time.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s no new form factor or facelift, but we all expected that. What we have got on our hands are some pretty major internal updates and an enhanced user experience from top to bottom.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p>
<h2><strong>Headline Features</strong></h2>
<p>[list type="check"]</p>
<ul>
<li>12MP iSight camera</li>
<li>3D Touch technology</li>
<li>New Rose Gold option</li>
<li>Enhanced Touch ID</li>
<li>Faster A9 processor</li>
<li>Sturdier design</li>
</ul>
<p>[/list]</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>12MP iSight Camera</strong></h2>
<p>For many, the all-new iSight camera is a huge shout for both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.</p>
<p>Whilst the 8MP iSight camera has been significantly improved over the generations, a bump in megapixels is a welcomed prospect.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re dealing with now is a 12MP sensor that&rsquo;s capable of taking DSLR (professional quality) like photos.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7875 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/12MP-camera-on-iPhone-6s.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/12MP-camera-on-iPhone-6s.jpg alt=&rdquo; 12MP camera on iPhone 6s&rdquo;/>" width="844" height="466" data-id="7875" /></p>
<p>It features 50% more pixels than the previous iSight camera, and 50% more focus pixels, so autofocus is way faster and even more accurate.</p>
<p>This new shooter will also record in 4K video (8 million pixels per frame), so your videos will look absurdly sharp. And the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded to 5MP.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s super exciting is the new feature called Live Photos. It essentially brings your photos to life when you press and hold down on them (using 3D Touch &ndash; more on this next).</p>
<h2><strong>Display / 3D Touch</strong></h2>
<p>After the record-breaking success of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple has stuck with the same winning display sizes: 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches.</p>
<p>The resolutions, both of which are uber crisp, are unchanged too, with iPhone 6s sporting a 750 x 1334 pixel Retina HD display, and iPhone 6s Plus a 5.5-inch 1080 x 1920 pixel Retina HD display.</p>
<p>Rather than investing too much in display resolution (and the consequential drain on power), Apple has instead focused on integrating its revolutionary new 3D Touch technology.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7876" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/3D-Touch-Screen1.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/3D-Touch-Screen1.jpg alt=&rdquo; 3D Touch Screen&rdquo;/>" width="844" height="470" data-id="7876" /></p>
<p>Built into the screen, 3D Touch creates new ways to interact with iPhone, by applying different levels of pressure. It brings a whole new dimension to play around with.</p>
<p>What that means is, when you press a little harder on the touch screen, extra commands and functions pop up, helping you navigate through iOS 9 even quicker.</p>
<p>So for example, you can &lsquo;peek and pop&rsquo; to preview content, like emails, flight info or calendar events &ndash; all without actually opening anything.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7873 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/3D-Touch.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/3D-Touch.jpg alt=&rdquo;3D Touch&rdquo;/>" width="841" height="471" data-id="7873" /></p>
<p>This technology (which exists on Apple Watch and the new MacBook) could become as significant to iPhones (and other smartphones), as a mouse&rsquo;s right click is to computers&hellip;</p>
<h2><strong>New A9 Chip</strong></h2>
<p>Naturally, Apple has housed a new 3<sup>rd</sup> gen 64-bit A9 processor and M9 motion co-processor, both of which eclipse previous generations with their power and proficiency.</p>
<p>To put this into numbers, the new Apple A9 chip boasts 70% faster CPU performance than the A8, and 90% faster graphic performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7874 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/A9-Processor.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/A9-Processor.jpg alt=&rdquo;A9 Processor on iPhone 6s offers 90% better graphics&rdquo;/>" width="842" height="378" data-id="7874" /></p>
<p>Capacity wise, it&rsquo;s the same affair once again. You&rsquo;ll be able to pick up either version of the new iPhone with a storage space of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB.</p>
<h2><strong>More Durable Design</strong></h2>
<p>As indicated by the &lsquo;s&rsquo; in iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, these are internal upgrades rather than a complete design overhaul, as witnessed last year.</p>
<p>In other words, you&rsquo;re looking at the same, stunning aesthetics as those found on iPhone 6.</p>
<p>The power button rests on the familiar right-hand side of the new iPhones, sat just above the pin-release sim tray.</p>
<p>On the adjacent edge we can see the elongated volume rockers, as well as the super convenient silent / loud switch.</p>
<p>Though, looking at the specs, we can see a couple of design modifications, albeit, largely inconspicuous ones.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-7877 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/Apple-iPhone-6s-spec-overview.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/09/Apple-iPhone-6s-spec-overview.jpg alt=&rdquo;Apple iPhone 6s spec overview&rdquo;/>" width="840" height="468" data-id="7877" /></p>
<p>Firstly, both iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are 0.2mm thicker than their forebears, now measuring 7.1mm and 7.3mm respectively.</p>
<p>And secondly, there&rsquo;s a clear #Bendgate consideration.</p>
<p>Despite that &lsquo;scandal&rsquo; effecting a negligible number of iPhone 6 users, Apple has sought to combat any potential repeats by fashioning its new flagships from the less pliable 7000 series aluminium.</p>
<p>Bets on the first bend test?</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the new rose gold iPhone we&rsquo;ve been treated to, introduced to supplement the grey, silver and gold models.</p>
<h2><strong>Faster Touch ID</strong></h2>
<p>With the increasing adoption of Apple Pay, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both feature a new Touch ID sensor, which Apple say is twice as fast at recognising your fingerprint.</p>
<h2><strong>Just a bit on the side...</strong></h2>
<p>Apple also unveiled a selection of new smartbands for Apple Watch, told us some more about Apple Watch&rsquo;s OS update (Watch OS 2) and a new, larger iPad, called iPad Pro. Oh, and an update to Apple TV that now boasts a refreshed interface and voice command.</p>
