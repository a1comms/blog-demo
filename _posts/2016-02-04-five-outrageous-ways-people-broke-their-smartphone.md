<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Think it will never happen to you? Think again as we take a light-hearted look at five outrageous ways people broke their smartphone! We really wouldn&rsquo;t recommend trying these at home...</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-8379 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/dog.png" alt="dog breaking mobile phone" width="276" height="283" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">Phones and animals don&rsquo;t mix</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">For this section, one example stands out as being the funniest: the person who accidentally threw their phone for their dog to catch, instead of a ball. Needless to say, the dog caught it, and, erm, ate it. Basically, as actors say, never work with children and animals, and funnily enough, that brings us onto...</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">Phones and children don&rsquo;t mix</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Young children are constantly learning about the world, but the way they learn about everything is to either smash it on the floor, or try to eat it (or possibly both). Our favourite story in this section, though, involves doting parents, a young baby, a phone, and a nappy that needed changing. You probably already worked out where that one goes...</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-8389 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/car-roofs.png" alt="phones and car roofs don't mix" width="284" height="289" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">Phones and car roofs don&rsquo;t mix </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Next we come to the old chestnut: leaving something on top of a car, then driving off. This author has done it with sheet music, but it tends to be a bit more heartbreaking with phones. They tend to go smash.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of course, it gets doubly heartbreaking if you back up to investigate, and end up reversing over your phone...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8399" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/rhino.png" alt="Rhino destroying phone" width="266" height="276" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">Phones and duvets don&rsquo;t mix (but rhinos are apparently fine) </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">We were going to include a section about phones being dunked in water, but you already know about that. Instead, this story caught our eye, as it involves a phone that survived being dropped downstairs, thrown, sat on and trampled by rhinos, before eventually being destroyed by a duvet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just... how?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8400" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/high-five.png" alt="dog high five" width="266" height="276" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">Phones and high fives don&rsquo;t mix </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">This story gives us a perfect mental image. Imagine this, and try not to titter: dad goes to do a high five with his son, dad had phone in palm of hand, dad launched phone into a wall. That&rsquo;s too perfect a mental image to not include in this article!</p>
