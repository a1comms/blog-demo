<p>For those of us who love using laptops, tablets or other Wi-Fi enabled devices in public places (because, let&rsquo;s face it, we look big-time), tethering from a mobile phone might feel like a convenient solution for browsing the web.</p>
<p>Especially given the unreliability of free public Wi-Fi, and the misgivings around its security.</p>
<p>But, it turns out, whilst tethering <em>is</em> convenient, it&rsquo;s by no means the best, or even an ideal answer to your Wi-Fi woes. This becomes even truer the more you tether to your mobile, as you&rsquo;ll soon realise.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re guilty of serial tethering, to stay connected on the move, you&rsquo;ll benefit massively from reading our five reason why tethering totally sucks.</p>
<h2>1. Tethering can block calls and texts</h2>
<p>Depending on your network, when another device is tethered to your phone&rsquo;s internet connection, some core functions can be thwarted. Like the voice service, preventing you from making or receiving calls. And, likewise, sending or receiving text messages.</p>
<h2>2. Tethering eats your mobile phone data</h2>
<p>By frequently piggybacking on your mobile phone&rsquo;s data allowance, you&rsquo;ll find that you can quickly burn through it, especially if you don&rsquo;t have a lot to begin with. Too much, and you might find yourself without any data left at all for the rest of the month.</p>
<h2>3. Tethering drains your mobile phone battery</h2>
<p>The connection created when tethering to your mobile phone exerts a lot of strain on your battery, draining power more rapidly than you&rsquo;d like. Less than ideal if you&rsquo;re out and about without a charger.</p>
<h2>4. Tethering can throttle your data speed</h2>
<p>By sharing your phone&rsquo;s data connection with another device, you might find your browsing speed is impeded, especially when streaming music or video content. The more devices sharing the connection, the slower the experience usually gets.</p>
<h2>5. Tethering can be capped and even chargeable</h2>
<p>Some network providers can place a cap on the amount of data available for tethering, and there can be unwanted charges too if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<h2>The Solution&hellip;</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-wifi">Mobile Wi-Fi</a>. It&rsquo;s the best way to connect devices like your laptop to the internet, when you&rsquo;ve no access to secure Wi-Fi, because it circumvents all of the problems listed above. And also makes a wiser option than public Wi-Fi (when it&rsquo;s available&hellip;), because Mobile Wi-Fi creates its own secure and private connection, much like the one you have at home.</p>
<p>As more people become savvy to the shortcomings of mobile tethering and free public Wi-Fi, Mobile Wi-Fi devices are sky-rocketing in demand. We now range a selection of 4G-enabled Mobile W-Fi modems, offering varying amounts of data, available on flexible contracts to suit your needs.</p>
