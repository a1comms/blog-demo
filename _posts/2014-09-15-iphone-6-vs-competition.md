<p><span class="postStandFirst">Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the past week, you have no doubt heard all about the launch of the newfangled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. &nbsp;We absolutely love them; but the critical question we should be asking is: how do they compare with their competition?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5243" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/BM-Blog-Phone-Compare-1.png" alt="iPhone 6 competitors " width="800" height="431" /></p>
<p>iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have been stealing all of the industry headlines, after Apple finally unveiled them last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apple has dubbed iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus as &lsquo;bigger and better&rsquo; than any previous iPhone. We concur, with absolute conviction. They both house state-of-the-art &lsquo;Retina HD&rsquo; displays, upgraded camera units, formidable processors and an all-new, tremendously attractive design.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m sure you would all like to know how iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus compare to their competitors.</p>
<p>Since the smaller iPhone 6 fits into the &lsquo;smartphone&rsquo; category, rather than the &lsquo;phablet&rsquo; one, it seems appropriate to compare it to its similar-sized counterparts, namely HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia Z3 and Nokia Lumia 930.</p>
<p>To give you an overview of how iPhone 6 competitors match up against iPhone 6 itself, we&rsquo;ve put together an insightful chart containing their raw specifications. It&rsquo;s important to remember, however, that specs don&rsquo;t <em>always</em> tell the entire story&hellip;</p>
