<p><span class="postStandFirst">After months of hype, Windows 10 has finally been released! Join us as we take a look at Microsoft&rsquo;s new operating system, both in the present (at the desktop version available now) and the future (the mobile version coming later in the year)...</span></p>
<p>After months and months of teasing, the era of Windows 10 has finally begun! It marks Microsoft&rsquo;s big push to unify their operating system across multiple platforms, to provide one big interconnected experience for its users.</p>
<p>The two big areas are, as you might expect, desktop and mobile. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at them <em>both</em>, and see what&rsquo;s what...</p>
<h2><strong>Windows 10 for mobile&nbsp;f</strong><strong>eatures</strong></h2>
<p>The whole point of Windows 10 is <em>interoperability</em>; the best way to think of it is that Windows 10 is basically <em>one</em> operating system, with two different versions on mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>From a developer point of view, that means that apps made for Windows 10 can easily be ported between desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Naturally, that means you should see lots more apps on your Windows 10 phone, directly ported from the PC, with the two versions sharing the same interface.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7599 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/The-New-Windows-Store.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/The-New-Windows-Store.jpg alt=&rdquo;The New Windows Store&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="450" data-id="7599" /></p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s much more to this interoperability lark than just easier porting of apps; one <em>really</em> cool feature is that notifications are synced across your PC and your phone, and dismissing a notification on one will dismiss it on the other.</p>
<p>You can also expect to see Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Continuum&rdquo; concept making an appearance. We&rsquo;ll go into more detail on what that is in a second, but for now, suffice to say that if you plug your Windows 10 phone into a big monitor, the interface will scale up into a kind of PC-Lite interface, complete with mouse and keyboard support.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be <em>quite</em> the same as carrying your PC around in your pocket, but what&rsquo;s surprising is how close it is to being just that!</p>
<p>Finally, you can expect to see a brand new version of Office Mobile, based around the version seen on Android and iOS; it will include new versions of Office and a new version of Outlook, and you&rsquo;ll also see a new browser in there (Microsoft Edge, replacing Internet Explorer Mobile).</p>
<h2><strong>Windows 10 for mobile handset compatibility</strong></h2>
<p>If you like the sound of that, your next question is probably: will my Windows phone be able to Windows 10?</p>
<p>The answer is: <em>hopefully</em>. Microsoft has said that they are planning to make it available for every Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Although, based on the hardware specifications, Microsoft probably means every Lumia phone that can run Windows Mobile 8, has a screen resolution of 800x480 pixels, and features at least 512MB of RAM). But the first target is the <em>majority</em> of Lumia phones on the market.</p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-7601 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/phone-1024x651.png" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/phone.png alt=&rdquo;Lumia Mobile Phone with Windows 10&rdquo;/>" width="960" height="610" data-id="7601" /></p>
<p>So, modern Lumia phones are covered, but what about phones made by other companies, like HTC or Samsung? Well one non-Microsoft phone is definitely compatible already: the HTC One (M8) for Windows.</p>
<p>When it comes to <em>other</em> third party phones, it will be a case of which manufacturers play ball, so at the moment, it&rsquo;s very much a case of &ldquo;watch this space&rdquo;...</p>
<h2><strong>Windows 10 for mobile release date</strong></h2>
<p>So, when will you be able to update your phone to Windows 10? That&rsquo;s where things get a little murky, as the simple answer is that Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t actually told anyone yet.</p>
<p>The only information anyone has is that it&rsquo;s due to land later in the year, although the likely timeframe seems to be somewhere from September to November.</p>
<p>Again, keep your eyes on this space...</p>
<h2><strong>How do I get Window 10 for mobile&nbsp;and what does it cost?</strong></h2>
<p>Quite simply, if it follows the pattern set by Windows 10 for PCs (and there are strong hints that it will), Windows 10 will be a <em>free</em> upgrade for smartphones!</p>
<p>If it also follows the pattern set by previous Windows Phone updates, it will simply be a case of tapping the notification that comes up onscreen, and following the steps to install it to your device, although we&rsquo;ll have more info on this when Microsoft publishes it.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on the Windows 10 revolution <em>now</em> (and get a head start on all that interoperability goodness), you&rsquo;ll be wanting to get yourself Windows 10 for your PC, so let&rsquo;s <em>also</em> take a look at that...</p>
<h2><strong>Windows 10 for PC features</strong></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about interoperability, so let&rsquo;s look at some of the biggest PC-specific features of Windows 10. We&rsquo;ll start with the biggest, which is, technically, if one goes only by version numbers, a downgrade:</p>
<p><em>Glory be, the Start Menu is back!</em></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7593 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/The-familiar-Start-menu-is-back.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/The-familiar-Start-menu-is-back.jpg alt=&rdquo;The familiar Start menu is back&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="450" data-id="7593" /></p>
<p>If there was one thing about Windows 8 that made everyone throw their toys out the pram, it was the lack of a Start button, and the insistence on everything being done through a tablet-like Live Tiles interface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant for tablets, but distinctly less than pleasant on desktop PCs, so the triumphant return of the Start Menu is a very good thing indeed (and Microsoft has worked the Live Tiles into it, making it even better).</p>
<p>However, the tablet-esque interface still exists, and it&rsquo;s here where we come back to the Continuum concept mentioned earlier; Windows 10 can scale and adapt its interface based on what <em>type</em> of device you&rsquo;re using, and <em>how</em> you&rsquo;re using it.</p>
<p>Plug a keyboard and mouse into a Surface tablet running it, for example, and it will prompt you to switch from tablet view to desktop view.</p>
<p>Oh, and expect to see Cortana, Microsoft&rsquo;s virtual assistant, popping up on your PC; she&rsquo;s made the jump from phones to desktops, and is just as brilliant as ever!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7592 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Cortana-in-Windows-10.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Cortana-in-Windows-10.jpg alt=&rdquo;Cortana in Windows 10&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="450" data-id="7592" /></p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll be joined by the same new browser found in mobile versions, Microsoft Edge, a standards-compliant browser which will make web designers lives so much simpler.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you have an Xbox One, you can play games remotely on it, through your Windows 10 PC. That&rsquo;s very cool indeed.</p>
<h2><strong>Windows 10 release date</strong></h2>
<p>The simple answer? Now. Windows 10 is available now (although it&rsquo;s being punted out to Windows Insider testers first, followed by everyone else).</p>
<h2><strong>How do I get Windows 10 for PC&nbsp;and how much&nbsp;does it cost?</strong></h2>
<p>Are you ready? Because here comes the best part...</p>
<p>Do you already own a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1? Well then, for the first year of availability, you can upgrade to Windows 10 for <em>free</em>!</p>
<p>If you are using a genuine version of either of those, then an upgrade icon should appear in your system tray; click on that, and you&rsquo;ll be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for the grand total of absolutely nothing whatsoever.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7594 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Windows-10-Upgrade-Notification.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Windows-10-Upgrade-Notification.jpg alt=&rdquo;Windows 10 Upgrade Notification&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="450" data-id="7594" /></p>
<p><strong>The price for a new copy of Windows 10 (if you&rsquo;re going for a new install on a new PC, for instance) will depend on which version you go with: the prices currently listed online are around &pound;80 for Windows 10 Home and &pound;140 for Windows 10 Pro.</strong></p>
