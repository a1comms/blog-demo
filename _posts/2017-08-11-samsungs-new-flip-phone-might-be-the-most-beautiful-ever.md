<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">There&rsquo;s just one, small catch&hellip;</span></p>
<p>If you thought flip phones were a thing of the past, think again. Yes, Samsung has just announced a brand new, high-end flip phone. While there have been rumours flying around left, right, and center concerning the device, we finally have the official details.</p>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s new flip phone is called Leader 8, and the design is ultra-sleek and sophisticated, with a black body (gold is available, too) and gold detailing. What&rsquo;s more, the materials are fashioned from no less than aviation-grade aluminum alloy. It&rsquo;s clear to see that this is not your average flip phone; everything about it screams class.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Samsung Leader 8 is powered by the ever-popular Snapdragon 821 chipset, which making it a real competitor against flagship devices on the market right now. As if that weren&rsquo;t enough to impress gadget fans, it also features a Full HD resolution on a&nbsp;4.2-inch Super AMOLED display.</p>
<p>Aside from boasting many of Samsung&rsquo;s core features, there are a couple of things that set the Leader 8 aside from the pack. With a 12MP camera on the back of the device, just above the fingerprint scanner, and a 5MP lens on the front, you&rsquo;ll never take a bad picture with this flip phone.</p>

<p>In addition, Samsung Leader 8 supports wireless charging, so you can pump up its 2300 mAh battery without ever plugging in. The device will also feature Samsung Pay, for wireless payments without your bank card.</p>

<p>So, when can you get your hands on a Samsung Leader 8? Well, maybe never. Unless you live in China, that is. There have been no official plans from Samsung to release the Leader 8 in western markets. Instead, the rumour is that it will be exclusive to China Mobile, limiting availability to China. Still, we can marvel at how darn pretty it is!</p>
