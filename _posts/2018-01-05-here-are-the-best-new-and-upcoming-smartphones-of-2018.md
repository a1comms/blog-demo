<h2>Nokia 9 - January</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQyjRRIK7o8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re still pretty hyped about Nokia 8, there&rsquo;s another, newer Nokia smartphone that may well be on the horizon. Cue, the Nokia 9.</p>
<p>This upcoming phone is likely to be revealed later this month (19 January - according to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/nokia-9-release-date-news-and-rumors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRadar</a>). In theory, it should have all the great features of the Nokia 8, complete with a few new extras.</p>
<p>Rumour has it that Nokia 9 will boast a large 5.5-inch QHD display (up slightly from Nokia 8&rsquo;s 5.3-inch display), which will no doubt look incredible. As for the design, it&rsquo;s reported that it&rsquo;ll be an all-metal affair with curved edges and a water-resistant build.</p>
<p>Other upgrades could include some rather snazzy-sounding 360 audio recording capabilities, and a better camera system than ever before. Some sources are speculating a 13MP selfie camera on the front, which is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.</p>
<h2>LG G7 - January / February</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXchwVdJTno" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>What could be first in our best new and upcoming smartphones of 2018, is the highly-anticipated LG G7.</p>
<p>Many have suggested that this device will be launched at CES 2018, which just so happens to take place this month! Other reports claim that <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/lg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG</a> is holding out for a launch at MWC 2018 instead, which is in late February. Either way, we think LG G7 will be announced soon!</p>
<p>We expect LG to continue with the all-screen format, which it debuted on the LG G6 (and was the first of the major manufacturers to do so). According to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/lg-g7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRadar</a>, the screen might be curved this time, much like Samsung Galaxy S8. Other than that, you&rsquo;ll likely see a new, faster processor (hello Snapdragon 845), a sleeker design and the inclusion of wireless charging.</p>
<h2>Huawei P11 - February (MWC 2018)</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzUdhzYWEWE" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Likely to be with us much sooner than some of the other new and upcoming smartphones for 2018, Huawei P11 is another big one to look out for.</p>
<p>This flagship from <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei</a> is tipped to be announced at MWC 2018 in February, starting on the 25th. So far, there are rumours that Huawei P11 will run the Kirin 970 chip, and be more energy efficient than its previous incarnation, the mighty Huawei P10.</p>
<p>While no one really knows what features the device will boast, we&rsquo;ve heard a few things through the grapevine&hellip;</p>
<p>It could be that Huawei P11 has no headphone jack at all. Since Huawei&rsquo;s sister company, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/honor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honor</a>, waved goodbye to the jack, this move would make sense. Leaks suggest that Huawei is opting for an all-screen design, and facial recognition technology similar to Face ID.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S9 - February (MWC 2018)</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dZ7_z9YQ9Q" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung&rsquo;s</a> next best smartphones are likely to be two of the biggest launches of 2018. After all, both the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have been a huge success.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRadar</a>, the upcoming devices will be called Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus. No surprise there then. And we&rsquo;re looking at an MWC 2018 launch, which is scheduled for late February.</p>
<p>Apparently, they&rsquo;ll boast the 7nm Snapdragon 845 or 8nm Exynos 9810 processor (depending on the market). And will feature an Infinity display with a fingerprint scanner on the rear (this time <em>below</em> the camera lens on the back).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that Samsung won&rsquo;t have a few surprises for us too. We may find that the experience gets upgraded and that we get treated to a few nice little features as well. It&rsquo;s not too likely that the design will be shook up, though, as the tried and tested look seems to be a real hit with fans.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S9 Mini - February (big maybe)</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLI-r0HYzhQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Before now, there have been whispers of a Samsung Galaxy S8 Mini. However, no such phone has materialised. So, is it likely that Samsung Galaxy S9 Mini is on its way, instead?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, to accompany the larger Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus in late February, although we haven&rsquo;t seen a Mini for some time now, since Galaxy S5 Mini.</p>
<p>The powers at Samsung don&rsquo;t want to give anything away when it comes to this one, if it is more than rumour, so we really don&rsquo;t have all that much to go on.</p>
<p>Still, speculation can found, reporting a smaller 5-inch Infinity Display that will still pack all the same amazing features and quality you expect, just in a more compact size. This rumoured Galaxy S9 Mini would be perfect for anyone who loves the Samsung Galaxy S range, but wants a smaller phone.</p>
<h2>Sony Xperia XZ1 Premium - February (MWC 2018)</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwUITX8tmkI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A <em>premium</em> version of the Sony Xperia XZ1 could be with us soon enough. Most people expect <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony</a> to announce this brand-new flagship at MWC 2018 in February, around the 25th.</p>
<p>Rumour has it that the company will also be releasing the Sony Xperia XZ1S at the same time, as well as another phablet later in the year.</p>
<p>But back to the Sony Xperia XZ1 Premium, which is reported to feature a Snapdragon 835 or 845 processor, 6GB RAM and 64- or 128GB storage.</p>
<p>In addition, you can expect a 4K display, said to measure in at 5.7-inches. Like the Sony Xperia XZ Premium before it, you can bet this will be a real beast for media and gaming.</p>
<h2>iPhone 9 - September</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ap8CoCK_EE4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>As though iPhone 8 and iPhone X weren&rsquo;t enough to keep <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple">Apple</a> fans happy, there are already rumours of an iPhone 9 launching in 2018.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the device will be called iPhone 9, but there&rsquo;s a good chance that Apple will stick to its numerical naming system! Since the company tends to release new devices each September, we can expect to learn more about the new iPhone come autumn 2018.</p>
<p>So far, we know very little about it. There have been <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160">rumours</a> heralding a Super Retina Display, with a sharper than razor-sharp 2436 x 1125 resolution. It&rsquo;s likely that iPhone 9 will be available in varying screen sizes, and, like iPhone X, it will also use Face ID technology. Still, as there&rsquo;s no official word on Apple&rsquo;s next flagship iPhone, everything is still up in the air.</p>
<h2>Google Pixel 3 - October</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpyhDt1gS6A" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Google Pixel could be the one to watch this year with a whopping three new smartphones set to launch around October (probably the 4th, which is when Pixel and Pixel 2 were launched). Right now, the three devices go by the sneaky code names Crosshatch, Albacore and Blueline.</p>
<p>Rumours suggest that Google&rsquo;s next smartphones might mirror Apple&rsquo;s setup with iPhone X, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a>. What that means, is a top-tier device (iPhone X), and two lesser devices; one being a larger version (iPhone 8 Plus) of the other (iPhone 8).</p>
<p>Word is that Google&rsquo;s upcoming Pixel devices will feature the 7nm Snapdragon 845 processor, and run the yet-to-be-announced Android P (version 9.0).</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note X - 2018-2019</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2v1lQcbeqw8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Sticking with the Samsung theme for this one here; 2018 may be the year that we see the Samsung Galaxy Note X. Although reported release dates swing wildly from CES 2018, to much later in 2019.</p>
<p>Excitingly, rumours suggest that this will be a bendable device boasting some of the most impressive features of the modern age. Of course, it should be <em>noted</em> (pun-intended!) that it will probably have a price tag to match.</p>
<p>The device was previously dubbed Project Valley, but <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/mobile-phone/samsung-galaxy-note-x-3653300/">Tech Advisor</a> seems confident that it&rsquo;ll be called Samsung Galaxy Note X. The general idea is that the device will have a dual-screen, i.e. one on each side of it, and that you&rsquo;ll be able to fold it out to turn it into a larger tablet. It sounds uber futuristic, and we want to get our hands on one ASAP!</p>
<h2>Microsoft Surface Phone<strong> - </strong>It&rsquo;s a Mystery</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pI_v3wKTX9w" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been hearing about the potential Microsoft Surface Phone for quite some time now, but 2018 could be the year we see it come to life!</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, Microsoft recently filed a new patent for a foldable device, which means that the Surface Phone could very much be on its way. And in some style, too.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s all just rumour and hearsay at the moment (and has been for some time now&hellip;), it&rsquo;s certainly something for Windows and Microsoft fans to keep their eyes peeled for 2018.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Smartphone - It&rsquo;s a Mystery</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16172" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1fI6QJjHd0XltJWUcw8DVpfVsRxcbgiTEoldE2tO--QJOhfP6AgDlGvepEMTHAR4Um0hYv8T4rOaiMoIPozxL28X=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real &ndash; a Snapchat smartphone would be awesome. However... there&rsquo;s no concrete evidence that it will ever actually happen.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the company hasn&rsquo;t yet started to produce the rumoured smartphone. Still, they may be working on a connected camera for electronic device, according to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/mobile-phone/snapchat-phone-rumours-is-snapchat-working-on-smartphone-3654828/">Tech Advisor.</a></p>
<p>If the company does ever delve into the realms of smartphone manufacturing, we can expect something incredibly high tech. We&rsquo;re thinking that the selfie camera would be off the charts (well, it would <em>have </em>to be, right?) and the phone would look ultra-modern.</p>
