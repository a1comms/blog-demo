<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Boost your iPhone battery using these easy, effective tips.</span></p>
<p>Streaming HD video content and playing high-res games on your iPhone demands a lot of power. So it's no surprise that batteries don't last as long as the they used to on our Nokia bricks.</p>
<p>That being said, with the right tips and tricks up your sleeve, you can improve your iPhone battery life way beyond its typical duration. We're not talking about a few minutes. Follow our mobile battery advice and you could boost your iPhone by hours.</p>
<p>We recommend reading all of our iPhone battery tips and tricks, because combining them will help increase your battery performance in further.</p>
<h2>1) Update to the Latest Software</h2>
<p>Downloading the latest version of iOS doesn&rsquo;t just give you access to hot new features and an refreshed interface. They often include advanced energy-saving technologies says Apple, so they&rsquo;re worth the update.</p>
<p>Go to Settings > General > Software Update, and download any available new software.</p>
<h2>2) Don&rsquo;t Close Apps</h2>
<p>For as long as iPhones have allowed us to close our apps (by double-tapping the home button and flicking the windows away), we&rsquo;ve thought doing so would benefit our battery life. Guess what? It&rsquo;s a total myth.</p>
<p>Craig Federighi, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of Software Engineering, confirmed as much after receiving an email asking whether Tim Cook quits his apps frequently and whether it would improve battery. Federighi replied &ldquo;No and no.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12550" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/my-ee.jpg" alt="my-ee" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually possible that closing apps on a regular basis could have the opposite effect to what&rsquo;s intended, because your iPhone is forced to go through the strain of reloading apps each time. Not to mention that the screen uses power whilst you shut them down.</p>
<h2>3) Switch on Low Power Mode</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious solution for squeezing more life out of your iPhone is Low Power Mode. Introduced on iOS 9, it reduces your devices demands for power and can, according to Apple, yield an extra three hours of usage.</p>
<p>When your phone drains to 20%, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to switch Low Power Mode on. If enabled, it will automatically turn off once you recharge to 80%. But you can manually turn it on or off whenever you like by going to Settings > Battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12547" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/my-ee-low-power.jpg" alt="my-ee-low-power" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you turn it on and keep it on? Well, Low Power Mode prohibits certain apps and functions from performing as normal, like stopping Mail from fetching, turning off voice activation for Siri and dialling down some visual effects amongst other things. For up to three hours more battery life, it&rsquo;s a fair trade.</p>
<h2>4) Identify Your Power-Hungry Apps</h2>
<p>On iPhone, you have the ability to see exactly which greedy apps have gobbling up your battery life, helping you work out what to avoid when power is running low, or, perhaps, what to delete altogether to put a plug in the drain!</p>
<p>To see what apps are guilty of using up your battery, go to Settings > Battery and looking under Battery Usage. Filter to 7 Days for a better view on the most power-hungry apps.</p>

<h2>5) Tone Down Your Visual Effects</h2>
<p>Have you noticed how smooth your iPhone transitions from one app to another, and from apps to the home screen? You might also have caught the authentic effect that makes your app icons look as though they&rsquo;re floating on top of your wallpaper, as you tilt the phone gently side to side.</p>
<p>Your iPhone&rsquo;s silky visual effects are a deliberate design to please your eyes. But they&rsquo;re not such good news for your battery life, sapping it slightly throughout the day. The dynamic effects can be turned off, or reduced rather, to help conserve battery when you need to. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > turn on Reduce Motion.</p>

<h2>6) Stop Apps Refreshing in the Background</h2>
<p>Lots of your apps continue running in the background once you exit them. This is to keep the data fresh and up-to-date for your return. For most apps, refreshing in the background is pretty unnecessary, and actually strains your battery life.</p>
<p>We recommend you turn it off for all your apps, refreshing the data only when you open them. Do this by going to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and turning the toggle off. Or, at least, by turning individual apps off.</p>

<h2>7) Shut Down Location Services</h2>
<p>Some apps keep track of your location, even when you&rsquo;re not using them, to improve their service. Apps like Google Maps need to know where you are, of course, to help direct you when you&rsquo;re traveling somewhere. Switching off Location Services, however, is a quick win when you need to save some iPhone juice, and can be managed by heading to Settings > Privacy > Location Services.</p>

<h2>8) Get on Board with Airplane Mode</h2>
<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s great for keeping cabin crew happy and holiday phone bills down, Airplane Mode is also a great way to improve your iPhone battery life when you&rsquo;re still here in the UK.</p>
<p>When you find yourself stuck in a poor mobile coverage area, either with little or no signal, your iPhone burns through battery searching for a better connection. If you know coverage isn&rsquo;t likely to improve any time soon, turn Airplane Mode on and you&rsquo;ll boost battery life considerably.</p>

<p>You can do so by swiping the up Control Centre from the bottom of your screen, and tapping the airplane icon.</p>
<p>And that's it. Follow our tips and tricks and you can't fail to improve your iPhone battery life. If you know any good ways to boost battery, let us know by commenting below.</p>
