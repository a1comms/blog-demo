<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">How does Apple&rsquo;s latest offering fair against its old rival?</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the battle you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. Two of the biggest phones go head-to-head in the ultimate tech fight of the year. So, which will fair best? Let&rsquo;s look at what <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a> and Samsung Galaxy S8 have to offer, to find out!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>In truth, iPhone 8 doesn&rsquo;t look all that different from iPhone 7. It&rsquo;s not quite as radical as the upcoming, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-x-review-a-radical-new-look-for-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-screen iPhone X</a>.</p>
<p>Still, we&rsquo;re big fans of the familiar design, and it still looks in keeping with the latest gadgets. With the added bonus of a new glass back. After all, as the old saying goes, if it&rsquo;s not broken, why fix it?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15241" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GxxeGYo58avXVSqlNPo2yv40X98-xr9mDehA6IIb5r8wfmKMGQ2qZUYLCs9MciqSFl_PfaJpnleCKELWWrHfEofB=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy S8. While it&rsquo;s been around for a few months, there&rsquo;s still something rather shiny and new about it. It&rsquo;s one of the major selling points of the phone.</p>
<p>The bezels are all but gone, which means you get a larger screen for your money. And it just feels super modern; there&rsquo;s something utterly state-of-the-art about it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13605" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qaK0o_D4CsWA04WHWPFZQBRwAwsaig8w-eaxCzMoH99dk_ydEQ6jk5F_jEGllM0RC_2iozbmz_-39nVX-mdcc6VR=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Samsung has been leading the charge in display technology for some time, and that&rsquo;s not about to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8&rsquo;s display boasts a resolution of 1440 x 2960, with a huge 570 pixels per inch (ppi). What does that mean for you? Well, streaming higher levels of video definition is one the main benefits, since the Galaxy S8 can replicate the detail it was intended for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13608" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6aI5IfsSXZZ7RfQEc_4cbmXQYeBbnu4U-QHmA6-nUq9rLx1hs0llQWDlGHZngBCs-R4uko9pkAFf4eFNnPBF_eLp0Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, rather than focus on pure pixel resolution, Apple has focused on the quality of the display, improving the colour accuracy and white balance to ensure more natural reproduction.</p>
<p>For comparison, iPhone 8&rsquo;s resolution comes in at 1334&times;750 (with 326 ppi), which is probably enough for everyday tasks. Though you won&rsquo;t be able to stream video in the same high levels of definition as Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14946" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1jz1SOKYyM3PYyrmGv1sLmFTEz4GaOm9pLD-BBd0dWIe6PyefSk92fv0lqOzBX4jQX0o4fujZAaEGlYKCgrwcvZf=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Galaxy S8 is of coursed geared towards VR, which Samsung has been pushing for some time, giving the higher resolution more of a purpose.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Of course, as we all know by now, iPhone X has the snazziest new security system going, known as&nbsp;Face ID. Regrettably, though, iPhone 8 doesn&rsquo;t boast this feature&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15191" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R3Uz7BAYlg6W_qNJLhGvL6d2Wg7zUL8qHT0zfJxHOOfZe57dYh5oAFlw1068hPtMJTCxdTUhRokyB1aMfPEikoX4fw=s0" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>What iPhone 8 does have, as well Samsung Galaxy S8, is a fingerprint scanner, as well as the standard (and by now, rather impractical) passcode.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 also features an iris scanner, facial recognition, and a Secure Folder for private documents. So all things considered, we have to hand it to the Galaxy S8.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about the only camera that anyone cares about these days&hellip;&nbsp;the selfie camera.</p>
<p>iPhone 8 comes in with a 7MP shooter here, while the Galaxy S8 increases the resolution at 8MP. As always, comparing an iPhone with an Android on numbers alone can be misleading, but in terms of picture clarity, Samsung Galaxy S8 offers the sharper selfies.</p>
<p>One thing to celebrate about iPhone 8&rsquo;s selfie camera is the addition of Portrait Mode. Previously on iPhone 7 Plus (only the rear camera), it blurs out the background for artistic shots, and now features different finishes for different effects.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 178%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l378zJ7uJMQO9uhKU" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the rear camera, though, there&rsquo;s nothing between the two devices on pixels alone. Both offer an advanced 12MP camera that&rsquo;s capable of taking great quality pictures.</p>
<p>Portrait Mode on iPhone 8 (mentioned above) has been improved with new lighting effects. And video shoots in 4K at 60 fps, as well as 1080p slow-mo up to 240 fps.</p>
<p>Camera highlights on Samsung Galaxy S8 include the Pro Mode, which lets you control and adjust six settings, including: ISO, Shutter speed, Exposure, Colour tone, Manual focus, and White Balance. Playing with the shutter speed, for example, could help you achieve jazzy photos like the one below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15243" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ich0JhNGozChzCgxvyl6g31uUP10yGLYRJI7FnnnfDd8mN6IiW1cDRCsDu4iFU_B9koSPUx--Uwx4m8B1ez2PUy=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Bonus Features</h2>
<p>One of the major ways that Samsung has been ahead of the game was with wireless charging. However, with iPhone 8, Apple has finally got on board with this trend. Both the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 offer the latest Qi technology, which means that wires are a relic of a forgotten time.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, both devices are waterproof, with iPhone 8 featuring an IP67-certified casing, and Samsung Galaxy S8 an IP68 case.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15242" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ph3gjliLB7QEH6mY2eIb8pfit-z1TrlGYWjzzcggOBfmIfk4LqQ5bEh4QS0COpMABuBL81QW6m1U_W7mLEidWeAE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Storage wise, both devices come with a generous 64GB (although iPhone 8 is available with 256GB). And as for performance, the Galaxy S8 runs on a Samsung Exynos 8895 chipset, while iPhone 8 has the fancy new Apple A11 Bionic chipset. Both will guarantee a slick user experience.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The phone you choose will likely come down to whether you&rsquo;ve set up home in Camp Samsung or Camp Apple. If you&rsquo;re coming to this battle with no ties, though, it seems that Samsung Galaxy S8 has more to offer in terms of design, features, and even its display. That&rsquo;s until we compare it to iPhone X&hellip;</p>

<p>On the other hand, iPhone 8 does have a shiny new iOS and a whole load of extra features that you will no doubt enjoy. And there&rsquo;s no getting around the fact that it&rsquo;s one of the best flagship phones of the year. With that in mind, either one of these devices would be a truly excellent choice.</p>
