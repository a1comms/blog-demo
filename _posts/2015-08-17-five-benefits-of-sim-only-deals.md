<p><span class="postStandFirst">If you love your existing mobile phone, keep hold of it and opt for a SIM only deal.</span></p>
<p>When it comes to choosing a mobile phone plan, lots of people go for a 24-month contract deal, accompanied by a new smartphone.</p>
<p>For some, however, a shorter, more flexible contract is preferred, and a cheaper monthly tariff is considered more desirable than getting hold of the latest handset.</p>
<p>In such cases, <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sim-only" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIM only deals</a> emerge as the most suitable choice. As the name suggests, you&rsquo;re simply investing in a SIM card (and a chosen network tariff), not&nbsp;a mobile phone.</p>
<p>You may not realise, but there are loads of benefits to SIM only deals, making them a great choice for lots of people. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether one is right for you, you will be shortly.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>1) SIM only deals are flexible</strong></span></h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to commit to a 24-month contract when it comes to SIM only deals.</p>
<p>At Buymobiles.net, we offer both rolling one-month and 12-month plans, giving you greater flexibility.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to change your tariff more often, tailoring it to your requirements, rather than getting caught short each month, or finding you have too much data or minutes left over.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>2) SIM only deals are cheaper</strong></span></h2>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re paying for just the SIM card and accompanying tariff, there&rsquo;s no mobile phone cost to factor into your monthly bill.</p>
<p>So, in other words, the same amount of minutes and data will cost less on a SIM only deal, than they will as part of a contract plan.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll need to already own a mobile phone to insert and use your new SIM card.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>3) SIM only deals are convenient</strong></span></h2>
<p>Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) plans are also flexible and pretty affordable. Though they require you to top-up your mobile phone when you need to use it, which can be pretty inconvenient.</p>
<p>With SIM only deals, all of your minutes, texts and data are ready to use when you need them. And you also tend to get more for your money, than you do for PAYG plans.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>4) SIM only deals retain your existing number</strong></span></h2>
<p>Moving to a SIM only deal doesn&rsquo;t mean you should lose your mobile number.</p>
<p>To retain yours, simply contact your existing network to obtain a Port Authorisation Code (PAC). Once your new SIM card arrives, contact your new network and quote your temporary number (provided with new SIM), existing number (the one you want to keep) and your PAC. They&rsquo;ll sort out the rest.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>5) SIM only deals still get network perks</strong></span></h2>
<p>Just like regular contract mobile plans, SIM only deals shower you with awesome network benefits.</p>
<p>As an EE customer, you&rsquo;ll have access to double speed 4G (on selected tariffs), WiFi on the London Underground and mobile tethering for connecting your other devices, like PCs and tablets, to the Internet.</p>
<p>And by selecting a plan on Three, you&rsquo;ll be able to use your mobile phone abroad at no extra cost, thanks to Feel At Home, as well as tethering.</p>
