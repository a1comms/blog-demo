<p><span class="postStandFirst">The HTC One M8 is easily one of the most exciting phones of 2014, so it&rsquo;s perhaps not surprising that, according to a new rumour, HTC is already planning another phone to capitalise on the name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/13423829115_1e3028056d.jpg" width="500" height="395" />According to&nbsp;Swedroid&nbsp;(Google-translated link), Swedish network Telia has let slip on their website that a mini version of the&nbsp;HTC One M8&nbsp;is on the way, and it&rsquo;s called somewhat unsurprisingly, the HTC One M8 Mini.</p>
<p>Specifications are not existent at this point, as the rumour comes in the form of a list of phones which will support HD Voice on the Swedish network. In the HTC section, alongside the HTC One M8 Mini, was a listing for the HTC One M8 Mini, which has led people to believe that the phone is indeed on the way.</p>
<p>Naturally, this list has now been changed, but Telia&rsquo;s comment on the matter says that it was altered to better reflect the phones they have available &ldquo;right now&rdquo;. That is an interesting choice of wording, as while it doesn&rsquo;t confirm the existence of the One M8 Mini, it specifically doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>deny</em>&nbsp;it, either.</p>
<p>It does seem logical to suppose that HTC will indeed release a slimmed down version of their new flagship, not least because HTC said that strategy had been working well so far. Plus, while the HTC One M8 is competing against the likes of the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5, it seems almost inevitable at this stage that&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;manufacturers will release their&nbsp;<em>own</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;mini&rdquo; (or &ldquo;compact&rdquo;, as the case may be) phones.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, the HTC One M8 Mini seems like a sure bet, but stay tuned for more news on this story as it develops.</strong></p>
