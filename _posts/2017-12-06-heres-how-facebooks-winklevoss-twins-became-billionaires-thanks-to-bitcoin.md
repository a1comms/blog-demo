<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s a millions to billion tale!</span></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen The Social Network, it&rsquo;s time for a quick catch-up. Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss are the now-famous rowing twins who attended Harvard University together at around the same time as Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>While attending university, along with classmate Divya Narendra, they co-founded the Harvard Connection, which was later renamed ConnectU.</p>
<p>Claiming that Facebook was simply ConnectU repackaged and rebranded, the twins sued Zuckerberg back in 2004. They ended up losing their case but still got a whopping $65 million in damages.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen The Social Network, you might remember a line where one of the Winklevoss twins boasts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;, 220lbs and there&rsquo;s two of me.&rdquo; Simply put, these are two twins you don&rsquo;t want to mess with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re up to speed, here&rsquo;s the tale of how they turned their millions into billions. (Okay, it&rsquo;s not quite rags to riches, but you get the point here!).</p>
<p>Back in 2013, the pair decided to invest $11 million of their payout in an emerging trend &mdash; Bitcoin. They were, in fact, some of the earliest backers of the whole cryptocurrency phenomenon.</p>
<p>At the time, that sum of money got the brothers just 1% of the bitcoin currency that was in circulation at the time. It was a risky bet and one that few people would have taken at the time. You&rsquo;ve got to admire their guys. And needless to say, the bet paid off in a big way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;ve not been paying attention to the market value of Bitcoin, here&rsquo;s the deal: It has <em>blown up</em>. The value of the currency has gone through the figurative roof and then some in recent years.</p>
<p>Early backers have made more than they could ever have expected to when they first invested. Recently, the Daily Telegraph reported that the Winklevoss twins&rsquo; investment is now worth an astronomical $1 billion.</p>
<p>"We see bitcoin as potentially the greatest social network of all," Tyler Winklevoss explained to the Financial Times just last year. The twins were sunning it up in Ibiza when they first heard about the currency back in 2012. Smelling the whiff of success, they also launched their own digital currency exchange, Gemini, a few years later.</p>

<p>To add a little more intrigue to this whole affair, the bitcoin story has been one shrouded in mystery. No one actually knows who Satoshi Nakamoto, the supposed creator of the currency, is. He&rsquo;s basically Batman of the currency world. What&rsquo;s more, there seems to be no bank or asset backing it either. In a sense, one day, it just appeared.</p>
<p>The company is gaining more and more popularity, though. In fact, recently, Japanese officials legalised it as an official national currency. The trend may well take off too. Many other countries are reportedly getting regulators to look into the currency and decipher how to make it legal currency. Soon enough, we may all be using it. Scary? Well, maybe. Exciting? Definitely.</p>
