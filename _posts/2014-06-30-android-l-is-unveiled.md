<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google&rsquo;s biggest surprise of last year was the fact that they had officially partnered with Nestl&eacute;, in order to call the 2013 version of Android &lsquo;KitKat&rsquo;. The big surprise in 2014 is that Google has apparently dropped the dessert-themed naming scheme altogether...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4409" alt="Android L" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/Android-L-1024x675.png" width="672" height="442" /></p>
<p>Yes, the latest and greatest version of Android has been unveiled, and this year, according to Engadget, it&rsquo;s simply called Android L.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s not been confirmed which phones will definitely be getting an update to this new version, HTC has pledged to bring it to their flagships, the likes of the HTC One M8, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable to suggest that current superphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the stunning LG G3 will follow suit.</p>
<p>We have to say that anyone whose phone <i>does </i>get updated to Android L is in for a treat. Not only does it have a much more refined and sleek interface (based on a concept called Material Design, where UI elements within Android are treated as actual materials instead of simple graphics), making it the prettiest version of Android, but it also includes some new functionality which is bound to capture the imaginations of fans all round the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s interactive notifications, for one thing, as well a much deeper connection between Android, the web and Chrome, with the new &ldquo;recents&rdquo; interface listing apps you&rsquo;ve recently used, as well as links you&rsquo;ve viewed not just on the phone, but within Chrome on your PC!</p>
<p><strong>Android L will also include more business-oriented features, and a new battery-saver mode.</strong></p>
