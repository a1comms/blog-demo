<div id="stcpDiv"><span class="postStandFirst">HTC is rumoured to be working on a smartwatch called the HTC One Wear, which is projected to be unveiled around the end of August. Details are scant, but it&rsquo;s said to have a round face, like the Moto 360, with a choice of polycarbonate or metal shells. It&rsquo;s also possible that it will be a standalone unit, able to work without being linked up to a phone like the HTC One M8.</span></div>

<div>Smartwatches are becoming more ubiquitous, now that almost every manufacturer has made their own. One of the manufacturers who hasn&rsquo;t yet made one is HTC, but we now have a better idea of when they&rsquo;re going to do so<strong>.</strong></div>

<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>According to TKTechNews, the rumoured HTC smartwatch now also has a name. It&rsquo;s said to be called the HTC One Wear, and the ETA for this elusive device is late-August/early-September.</p>
<p>At the moment, of course, details are very thin on the ground, although when we say &ldquo;thin on the ground&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s perhaps more accurate to say &ldquo;pretty much all we know is a name&rdquo;. However, we may be able to glean some clues from HTC&rsquo;s Peter Chou, who said, earlier in the year, &ldquo;<em>It has to meet a need, otherwise it&rsquo;s just a gimmick or a concept, it&rsquo;s not for people&rsquo;s day-to-day lives, and that&rsquo;s an opportunity for us.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>While that could mean a number of different things, the most logical guess is that Chou was talking about something that has plagued early smartwatches, and which we&rsquo;ve spoken about before. With current smartwatches, they need to be linked to a separate smartphone to work (for example, by linking the Samsung Gear 2 to the Samsung Galaxy S5). It&rsquo;s possible, then, that HTC&rsquo;s smartwatch will be a standalone unit, instead of just an accessory for the HTC One M8, which would make it a much more attractive smartwatch in our eyes.</p>
<p>Given the name, we&rsquo;d also expect it to run on Android Wear, and the source link claims it have a round fascia, just like the Moto 360, and will come in a choice of polycarbonate or metal bodies.</p>
<p><strong>While there&rsquo;s no way to guarantee the accuracy of this rumour, it&rsquo;s not too long until the projected launch window, so we don&rsquo;t have to wait long till we can find out! Stay for more news!</strong></p>
