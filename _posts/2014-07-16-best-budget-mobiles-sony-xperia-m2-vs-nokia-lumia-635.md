<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">We put two of the best budget mobiles to the test, the Sony Xperia M2 and the Nokia Lumia 635, to see which one makes the grade.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sony Xperia M2</span></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="Sony Xperia M2" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/xperia-m2-black-1240x840-60271196b119d9cf8cac50e166e7c71f-1024x693.jpg" width="576" height="389" /></p>
<p>Sony wowed the world with the amazing Sony Xperia Z2, but that phone doesn&rsquo;t fit everyone&rsquo;s budget; and so, we have the Sony Xperia M2, a gorgeous mid-range phone that really stands out from the pack.</p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p>Modelled after the top-end Xperia Z2, the Sony Xperia M2 exudes class, with an elegant, iconic body that belies its mid-range price tag. The chic body and the vibrant 4.8-inch screen make the Sony Xperia M2 one of the most sumptuous mid-range phones money can buy.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-4609 aligncenter" alt="Sony Xperia M2" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Sony-Xperia-M2.jpg" width="655" height="263" /></p>
<p>Equipped with an 8MP camera (which itself includes HDR, image stabilisation and face/smile-recognition), the Sony Xperia M2 once again acts more like a top-end phone than a mid-ranger. It will also let you record 1080p video, making this perfect mid-range phone for capturing those memories in moving images.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The Sony Xperia M2 comes with Android Jelly Bean (with a planned upgrade to Android KitKat), making it both powerful and customisable. Not only does it offer a range of features to make your life easier, but you can truly make your phone your own with the Sony Xperia M2!</p>
<h2>Perfect for...</h2>
<p><strong>People who want a mid-range phone that looks and acts like a premium, top-end flagship.</strong></p>
<p>Buy a Sony Xperia M2...</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="center">Nokia Lumia 635</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="Nokia Lumia 635" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/635-grn-or-2x1-png-1024x512.png" width="691" height="346" /></p>

<p>Now owned by Microsoft, Nokia is on a mission to put its Windows Phone platform to as many pockets as possible. The next tool in their plan to do that is the utterly funky Nokia Lumia 635.</p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about the Nokia Lumia 635 is how outrageous it looks (in a <i>really</i> good way). You know a phone doesn&rsquo;t follow the pack when most of the available colours listed have &ldquo;bright&rdquo; in front of them, and the Nokia Lumia 635 really does <i>not</i> disappoint!</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4598" alt="Nokia Lumia 635" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Lumia-635-2-1024x512.jpg" width="576" height="288" /></p>
<p>While the camera on the Nokia Lumia 635 doesn&rsquo;t quite match up to the Sony Xperia M2 (but then, few mid-range phone-cameras do), this 5MP shooter is still a glorious little beastie, and of course, Nokia is known for giving its phones great lenses, so it <i>will</i> be brilliant!</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Where the Xperia M2 is powered by Android, the Nokia Lumia 635 runs on Windows Phone 8.1, and that brings two important benefits: 1) a remarkably simple, intuitive user interface; and 2) the best virtual assistant ever made, in the shape of Cortana.</p>
<h2>Perfect for...</h2>
<p><strong>People who want a mid-range phone that looks wild enough to really stand out from the crowd.<br />
</strong><br />
Buy a Nokia Lumia 635...</p>
