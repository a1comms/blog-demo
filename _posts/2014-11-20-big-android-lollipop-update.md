<p><span class="postStandFirst">Android Lollipop is making its way onto phones now, but which phones will be getting updated to it, and when? Check out our handy guide, to see when your phone should get some new tweaks...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that Android Lollipop, the latest version of Google&rsquo;s smartphone platform, is one of the most hotly-anticipated updates the search giant has put out. It bring a huge raft of refinements and improvements to the Android experience, and a lot of people are champing at the bit, eager to know if and when their phone will get it.</p>
<p>So, when will your phone get Android Lollipop? Take a look below...</p>
<h2>Nexus</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6045" alt="Android Lollipop" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Android-Lollipop-1024x570.png" width="672" height="374" />It stands to reason that Google&rsquo;s own Nexus phones would be among the first to get the Android Lollipop update (with the new Nexus 6 coming with it out of the box, in fact). As for previous phones (i.e. the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 5), we&rsquo;re hearing that that the update went live on November 12th, and is thus available to download now!</p>
<h2>Motorola</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6046" alt="moto-g-4g-lte-2014" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/moto-g-4g-lte-2014.jpg" width="539" height="303" /></p>
<p>Motorola handsets are also amongst the first phones getting the Lollipop update. The Moto G 2014 and the Moto X 2014 reportedly already have the update available, while it&rsquo;s going to be landing on the current Moto X, Moto G <i>and</i> Moto E before the end of the year (according to Motorola).</p>
<h2>LG</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4212" alt="Great alternative to the Amazon Fire phone" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/LG-G3-2-847x1024.jpg" width="474" height="574" /></p>
<p>The Lollipop roll-out for the LG G3 began in Poland (as a test-bed to ensure there were no problems with the update, thus making the G3 the first phone in the world to get any kind of Lollipop update), so if it hasn&rsquo;t reached your G3 yet, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4921" alt="Claim your Samsung eStore voucher - Samsung Galaxy Alpha" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/04_SM-G850F_013_white-1024x682.jpg" width="672" height="447" /></p>
<p>The usual suspects (i.e. the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, plus the Samsung Galaxy Edge and Galaxy S5 Mini) are due to be getting Lollipop before the end of December, with the Galaxy Note 3 due to get it around February next year.</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3570" alt="HTC-One-M8-Press-Photo-4-1280x768" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/05/HTC-One-M8-Press-Photo-4-1280x768.jpg" width="768" height="461" /><br />
HTC got the Lollipop source code at the start of November, and vowed to get the update out within 90 days. Thus, expect to see Lollipop on the HTC One M8 and HTC One Mini 2 by around February of next year.</p>
<h2>Sony</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6034" alt="2Coloumn_module2_SonyXperia_vf1" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/2Coloumn_module2_SonyXperia_vf1.png" width="598" height="426" /></p>
<p>Sony has listed the &ldquo;beginning of 2015&rdquo; as the timescale for their phones getting the Lollipop update. Expect it to be rolled out first to current flagships like the Sony Xperia Z3 and the Xperia Z3 Compact, although the Xperia Z2 should get the update as well.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on more developments with the Lollipop update saga, so stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
