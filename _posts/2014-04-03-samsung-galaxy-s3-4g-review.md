<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung Galaxy S3 4G offers a unique and timeless combination of excellent functionality, exquisite design and intuitive features. Not to mention 4G data speeds.</span></p>
<p>Samsung says this handset has been &lsquo;designed for humans&rsquo;, and we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. It can see, it can listen and it responds to your behaviour accordingly. Samsung Galaxy S3 4G&nbsp;is one clever little contraption.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Cased in a&nbsp;brushed polycarbonate body, Galaxy S3 4G feels and looks every bit the luxurious device it was intended to be.</p>
<p>With dimensions of 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6mm and a weight of 133g, combined with smooth, chamfered edges, Samsung Galaxy S3 4G fits comfortably and unnoticed in your pocket; more importantly, it feels natural and well placed in the palm of your hand.</p>

<p>Galaxy S3 4G boasts a gorgeous 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display, and a superb resolution of 720 x 1280. With a screen this size and a picture quality this sharp, you can enjoy a superior viewing experience like never before.</p>
<p>HD videos and high-resolution games are instantly brought to life, offering crisper colours and detail almost as authentic as reality itself.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, is the beautiful screen on the Galaxy S3 4G has been designed to be incredibly energy efficient. So you can view content without the nagging worry of draining your battery.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The amalgamation of Android Jelly, a 1.5GHz dual core processor, 2GB of RAM and 4G data results in a tremendously enjoyable and fluid user experience. Apps run seamlessly, web pages load quickly and multitasking simply isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>This is a smartphone that you don&rsquo;t have to wait for &ndash; it&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.</p>
<p>Thanks to a durable 2100mAh battery, you&rsquo;ll also be able to get hours upon hours of user time, without being manacled to a power source.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Experience professional quality pictures with a superb 8-megapixel camera, complete with an LED flash.</p>
<p>Zero shutter lag ensures that your Galaxy S3 4G captures images when you ask it to, and not a moment later.</p>
<p>The camera&rsquo;s also capable of shooting full HD video at 1080p, and is coupled with a front-facing 1.9MP camera that&rsquo;s perfect for video calls.</p>

<h2>Extra Features</h2>
<p>Smart Stay will intuitively recognise when you&rsquo;re looking at the screen on your Galaxy S3 4G. The display will remain bright and beautiful whenever you&rsquo;re eyes are fixed on it, and then when you look away, it will automatically reduce the brightness in an effort to preserve your battery life.</p>
<p>S-Beam makes sharing content with nearby friends easier than ever. All you have to do is select what you want to send, whether it&rsquo;s music, pictures or contacts, and place the two Galaxy devices back to back and let them do the rest. It couldn&rsquo;t be simpler.</p>

<p>Best Photo will ensure that you never miss the perfect frame. An automatic burst of eight camera shots gives you the option to select the best snap. You can quickly discard the ones full of closed eyes and wonky smiles.</p>
<p>Smart Alert knows that you might not always have your phone in your hand, so if you receive any calls or text messages whilst the two of you are parted (heaven forbid), your Galaxy S3 4G will vibrate when you pick it up.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S3 4G is surely one of the most brilliant, beautiful and breathtaking devices that Samsung has ever produced.</p>
<p><strong>Boasting a list of creative and intuitive features; donning a stunning 4.8-inch full HD display; and wrapped up in an elegant, but understated case; Samsung Galaxy S3 4G is a truly well-rounded, well-thought out and well-executed handset.&nbsp;</strong></p>
