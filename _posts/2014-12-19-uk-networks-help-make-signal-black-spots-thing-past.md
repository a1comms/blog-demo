<p><span class="postStandFirst">In an effort to do away with signal black spots, the four big UK networks have pledged a combined total of &pound;5billion to a new undertaking, which aims to ensure 2G coverage is provided to 85% of the UK by 2017.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6170 size-medium" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/it_photo_83926-300x200.jpg" alt="it_photo_83926" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>We all know what it&rsquo;s like to need to make a phone call, only to find that you don&rsquo;t have a signal, especially for people who live or work in rural areas. A new undertaking by the major UK networks, however, is aiming to make signal black spots a thing of the past.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2014/12/networks-pledged-5-billion-tackle-signal-blackspots.html">ShinyShiny</a>, while they haven&rsquo;t yet said <em>how</em> they&rsquo;ll deal with issue, the four big networks have pledged a combined total of &pound;5billion to solving the problem.</p>
<p>One possible solution to the problem was suggested by the government when they pledged to tackle the issue of mobile black spots, namely that the networks could let users piggyback off <em>other</em> networks&rsquo; masts in areas where that network itself doesn&rsquo;t have coverage. The networks themselves apparently weren&rsquo;t keen on <em>that</em> idea, and the response is this pledge to give &pound;5billion toward solving the problem.</p>
<p>All four of the major networks (<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/ee">EE</a>, O2, <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/three">Three</a> and Vodafone) are involved in the deal, which aims to make sure that 85% of the UK (by landmass, not by population, which is an important distinction; offering coverage by population density is what led to this situation, as there is less population in rural areas, thus meaning the networks put up fewer masts in those areas) has a consistent signal for voice calls and text messages by 2017.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that this agreement only applies to <em>2G</em> coverage, so data services may still have some issues in those areas affected.</p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless, it is a hugely positive step (and we can see why 2G is being focused on first; 2G is also essential for things like emergency calls), and it&rsquo;s definitely a step in the right direction! Stay tuned for more news.</strong></p>
