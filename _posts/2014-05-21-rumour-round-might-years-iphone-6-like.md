<p><span class="postStandFirst">The new iPhone, the iPhone 6, is rumoured to be getting launched in September, so we take a look at what this next version (or versions, as there are rumoured to be two new iPhones debuting this year) might be like.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4319" alt="10688054314_8a959d0ff0" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/10688054314_8a959d0ff0.jpg" width="500" height="142" /></p>
<p><strong>There are a few constants in the world of smartphones; there&rsquo;s the progression of technology which makes top-enders become mid-rangers, there&rsquo;s the way that certain screen resolutions get locked in as the standard for specific price bands, and there&rsquo;s the fact that there&rsquo;ll be a new iPhone every year...</strong></p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>This year will undoubtedly be no different, and many people are expecting that this year&rsquo;s iPhone will be the iPhone 6. The big question, however, is this: what might the iPhone 6 actually end up being like?</p>
<p>There have been a number of different rumours about the iPhone 6, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what people are saying online, and see if we can work out what&rsquo;s what...</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The iPhone 6 is not just <em>one</em> phone</span></strong></p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>This first rumour is either really intriguing or a foregone conclusion (or, quite possibly, both): many sources are saying that there won&rsquo;t just be <em>one</em> new iPhone released this year. In a similar situation to the one that happened in 2013 (when both the iPhone 5c and the more powerful iPhone 5s went on sale), it&rsquo;s said that there will actually be <em>two</em> new iPhones released in 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4318" alt="9720801575_ea0b00f277" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/9720801575_ea0b00f277.jpg" width="441" height="500" /></p>
<p>Since this is exactly what happened last year, as well, this particular rumour sounds very plausible indeed, although there&rsquo;s no indication what the two phones might be <em>called</em>. As for what will be different between the two models, the rumours are all stating it will come down to screen size...</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bigger screens for everyone!</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, as is being reported by <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/14/likely-iphone-6-with-sharper-larger-1704-x-960-resolution-screen-in-testing/">9to5Mac</a>, Apple are rumoured to be moving away from the 4-inch screen seen in every model they&rsquo;ve released since the iPhone 5. Instead, the rumour states that while both new models will share the same 1704 x 960 pixels resolution, one variant will have a 4.7-inch screen, while the other will have a 5.5-inch screen.</p>
<p>This is, of course, totally unprecedented in the world of the iPhone (Steve Jobs famously said that no-one actually <em>wants</em> a bigger phone), but with big-screen superstars like the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5 doing so well in the market, it was perhaps inevitable that we would one day see an iPhone with a bigger screen.</p>
<p>As the old joke goes, you wait for ages, and then <em>two</em> come along at once...</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wireless charging?</span></strong></p>
<p>This next rumour is probably a lot more unlikely to come to pass than others on this list, as wireless charging has never really taken off in the mainstream. Nonetheless, some people are saying that it will indeed be happening with the next batch of iPhones, based on the fact that Apple has applied for a patent around wireless charging.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d take this rumour with a pinch of salt, for the time being, though.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A bigger camera?</span></strong></p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s rumoured that the next iPhone/iPhones will be some improvements in the field of camera tech. However, the rumour is that they won&rsquo;t be getting any <em>more</em> megapixels, but rather that each <em>individual</em> pixel will be physically bigger (as is the case with the HTC One M8). So, if this last one is indeed true, the low light performance of the iPhone 6 should be excellent.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, all of these are simply rumours, and until Apple officially launches the next iPhone (or iPhones), we won&rsquo;t know for sure. There&rsquo;s still a bit more time to wait, as the launch date is rumoured to be in September, so stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
