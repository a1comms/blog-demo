<p>Great news: Safe driving has just got a whole lot easier, thanks to Google. The simple navigation app, Google Maps, will soon be rolling out a handy speed limit feature, according to a report from Mashable.</p>
<p>That means that, when using the app as a SatNav, you will be able to see the speed limits in real-time as you move across the map.</p>
<h2>Say Hello to the Speed Limit Feature</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the feature is going to be ridiculously easy-to-use.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re driving along, you can just glance at the bottom left corner of the screen. Google Maps will have a small popup that tells you what the speed limit if of each road. Nice.</p>
<p>That should mean that sticking to the correct limit will be super simple. You have literally no excuse.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19917" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cvc-TYg7xu8SIawX5KsaPOIPs-MKjsPqIds-D-yVT6cR_WDpJ7QGZTI7jt572x3pIWLu8wTpJ-7SJWoj-Wbu6spB=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t end there. The app has another handy trick up its sleeve.</p>
<p>The UK version of Google Maps will also tell us the upcoming locations of speed cameras. These tricky little systems known as &lsquo;speed traps&rsquo; can often sneak up on us. We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<p>Luckily, having an extra feature on the app to give us a heads-up could make all the difference. The app will tell you about upcoming cameras before you reach them.</p>

<h2>You Can Report 'Speed Traps' Too</h2>
<p>Plus, if you&rsquo;d like to be a good Samaritan and help other drivers avoid these speed traps, you can also do your bit.</p>
<p>Google Maps also allows users to report cameras to the system. At just the touch of a button, you can let the app developers know where the cameras are and what the limit is. That should help the powers at Google stay up-to-date with the latest speed cameras and keep drivers safer than ever before.</p>
<p>This news comes after Google Maps purchased another maps app called <a href="https://www.waze.com/en-GB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waze</a> for around $1 billion back in 2013. The crowdsourced app was popular among drivers because of its speed limit-related features.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the app have long expected that Google would follow suit after buying it out. It might have taken some time for the features to make it onto the official Google Maps app, but it&rsquo;s better late than never.</p>

<h2>Now Available in the UK</h2>
<p>So, when can you expect these features? According to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-maps-speed-limits-speed-traps/?europe=true#GZrLecUtMsqD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mashable</a>, the new features for speed cameras and limits has already started to roll out for Android and iOS users in the UK.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep your eye out for updates on the app so you can be among the first to start using the latest features.</p>
