<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We bet you didn&rsquo;t know about this iPhone calculator hack.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that iOS has got many, many things right in the past. If you&rsquo;re an Apple fanatic, you&rsquo;ll rarely put up with a bad word being spoken about this operating system. Still, no one is perfect. and, sometimes, even the geniuses at Apple make mistakes now and then. If you head to the Calculator app on your phone, you may just find one.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s something missing from this particular app: a backspace button. If you make a mistake when you&rsquo;re crunching numbers, you have to start all over again. Annoying, right? Well, luckily for you, there&rsquo;s a handy hack that solves just this problem.</p>
<h2>How to Delete Numbers in the Calculator App</h2>
<p>Luckily for you, there is a way that you can delete those pesky digits in no time at all, without having to start all over. Although Apple did not include a backspace button in the app, the tech company has made it super-simple to delete things. Here&rsquo;s just what you need to do.</p>
<h2>1) Launch the Calculator App</h2>
<p>Obviously, the very first thing that you need to do is launch the Calculator app. Of course, you can do so simply by tapping on the icon on your homescreen. Or, if you want a quicker way to access the app, just swipe up from the home or lock screen, and select the Calculator.</p>
<h2>2) Crunch Some Numbers</h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t used the Calculator app in quite some time, it may be blank. So, you need to make sure that you type in a few numbers. You may want to do some quick sums or just type in the digits at random. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<h2>3) Get Swiping</h2>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s time to learn how to delete digits in the Calculator app. Swipe either left or right on the top on the screen where the digits appear. Each swipe will get rid of one number at a time. So, for example, if you have a three-digit number typed out, you&rsquo;ll need to swipe three times to get rid of the entire thing. Handy, right?</p>
<h2>Bonus Tip: How to Delete All Numbers</h2>
<p>Of course, if you don&rsquo;t want to get rid of the numbers one at a time, there&rsquo;s another option. Pressing the &lsquo;C&rsquo; button at the top of the screen will clear the whole thing and take you back to zero. Phew! Nothing could be easier. Now we can all sleep soundly at night.</p>
