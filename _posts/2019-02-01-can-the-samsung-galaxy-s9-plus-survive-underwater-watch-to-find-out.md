<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is the Galaxy S9 Plus really waterproof? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out. Don&rsquo;t try this at home, kids!</span></p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you know the drill. There&rsquo;s been a whole load of hype about the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/can-the-samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-survive-underwater-watch-to-find-out?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog%20article&amp;utm_campaign=s9-plus-waterproof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus</a>. The beautifully designed phone boasts a great 12-megapixel camera along with the acclaimed Infinity Display. It&rsquo;s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Besides being an awesome smartphone with oodles of features, the flagship device just so happens to be IP68 waterproof rated. Ignore the jargon &ndash; let&rsquo;s break it down. That should mean that the Galaxy S9 Plus can survive (and work!) in water depths of up to five feet.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus: Waterproof Test</h2>
<p>While most people see the waterproof rating as a neat little added feature, some see it as something of a challenge instead. YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey_c7U86mJGz1VJWH5CYPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iJustine</a>, decided to put the Galaxy S9 Plus claims to the test and see just how waterproof it really was. Yes, really.</p>
<p>In the short clip, which was filmed in the gorgeous-looking Hawaii, the presenter explains that she will get into a pool (despite not being able to actually swim!) with the phone, dip underwater, and see whether she can still use the phone to film herself.</p>
<p>So, after donning a snorkel mask and bathing suit, she steps into the pool, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus in her hand. She then takes a super-quick plunge under the water, while filming herself on the Galaxy device and attempting to swim.</p>
<p>So, do you think that the Samsung S9 Plus is waterproof and still worked? Place your bets. Luckily, you don&rsquo;t have to wait with bated breath to find out. Check out the video right here, right now:</p>

<p>So, there you have it! The Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus lives up to its own hype&hellip; and more. The underwater video quality is pretty darn impressive in itself and, as far as we see in the video, the underwater experience did no damage to the phone at all.</p>
