<p><span class="postStandFirst">The long, long wait is over, and our incessant questions have finally been answered, after Apple unveiled its next generation of iPhones. Come and meet iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5118 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus.png" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus" width="660" height="372" /></p>
<p>Tim Cook, Apple CEO, hosted the highly anticipated Apple Live event at the Flint Centre for the Performing Arts, California, where the late, great Steve Jobs introduced the original Macintosh back in 1984.</p>
<p>Whilst Apple&rsquo;s tech products have changed considerably since then, its relentless strive for innovation has remained a constant.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6 Display</h2>
<p>As we all predicted, Apple has announced two new iPhones, one of which will house a 4.7-inch display, the other, a 5.5-inch display. The smaller of the two has been labeled &lsquo;iPhone 6&rsquo; (shocker, we know), whilst the larger of the two is aptly called &lsquo;iPhone 6 Plus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>iPhone 6 features Apple&rsquo;s new Retina HD screen, with a resolution of 750 x 1334 and a pixel density of 326ppi.</p>
<p>iPhone 6 Plus, on the other hand, flaunts a larger Retina HD (Full HD) display with a 1080 x 1920 resolution (401ppi).</p>
<p>Larger screens will allow Apple to compete with a lot of other Android and Windows Phone devices in the market, which predominantly sport displays of 4.5-inches and above.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5119 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus-size.png" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus size" width="660" height="372" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 6 Design</h2>
<p>Apple has scrapped the squared edges and flat design of iPhone 5s, and adopted a much smoother body, with soft, chamfered edges. Both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have been trimmed down in thickness quite considerably, measuring at 6.9mm and 7.1mm respectively.</p>
<p>The volume rockers have also taken on a new design and are now elongated in to a pill shape.</p>
<p>The power button, which was previously located on the top right of iPhone 5s, has been relocated to the right-hand side of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, for better one-handed use.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5120 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus-measurements.png" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus measurements" width="660" height="372" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 6 Power</h2>
<p>Both new iPhones are equipped with enhanced processing power (25% more, to be precise), as they pack an A8 64-bit second-generation processor, a next-generation M8 motion coprocessor and a new barometer, too.</p>
<p>So, not only are iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus faster and more power efficient than any iPhone prior to them, they house a motion sensor that will be able to track things like the number of steps you&rsquo;ve taken, distance travelled and relative elevation from air pressure.</p>
<p>The battery life on iPhone 6 is an impressive 25% better than the one packed into iPhone 5s, whilst the battery in iPhone 6 Plus is an incredible 100% better.</p>

<h2>iPhone 6 Camera</h2>
<p>On the face of things, Apple has stuck with the same old 8-megapixel camera that we saw on iPhone 5s. However, when you dig a little deeper, you&rsquo;ll quickly discover why this is the most advanced iSight camera we&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>
<p>It features a new wide-angle lens, true tone flash, f/2.2 aperture, better face recognition, much greater noise reduction and a hybrid phase autofocus technique called &lsquo;Focus Pixels&rsquo;, which allows iPhone 6 to autofocus twice as quickly.</p>
<p>Optical Image Stabilisation, which counter-balances shaky hands to produce smoother results, has joined in on the fun, too. But, unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a software feature that will be exclusive to the larger, full-fat iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>Both iPhones can film in 1080p, and the slow-mo feature has been enhanced to capture footage at a staggering 240 fps. That&rsquo;s almost as slow as the 24 hours leading up to this event!</p>
<p>The front-facing 1.2-megapixel camera, or FaceTime HD camera as it&rsquo;s dubbed, is equipped with a brand new sensor that will allow in up to 81% more light, along with HDR support.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5117 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus-camera.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus camera" width="447" height="250" /></p>
<h2>Apple Pay</h2>
<p>The most rousing feature, for some, is Apple Pay. This is an upcoming service that will allow you to pay for items in retail stores with a one-touch step. Designed to replace credit and debit cards, Apple Pay stores a digital copy of your credentials in a digital wallet, if you like, called Passbook.</p>
<p>Apple Pay works using Near Field Communication (NFC), allowing users to tap their iPhone 6 against an NFC-enabled payment device in a retail store, and pay for an item in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Having doubts about the security? Well, don&rsquo;t. Apple Pay works in tandem with Touch ID, so the person, or rather the finger, that&rsquo;s registered to the iPhone needs to authorise the payment.</p>
<p>The fun doesn&rsquo;t stop there, as Apple Pay works with online purchases and a number of apps, like Groupon, Uber and the Apple Store, too.</p>
