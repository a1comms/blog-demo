<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It comes with free fried chicken&hellip; Apple and Samsung better watch out.</span></p>
<p>Deep fat fried food and high tech gadgets&hellip; that&rsquo;s what dreams are made of, my friends. If you agree, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat.</p>
<p>Just when you thought that the modern world we live in couldn&rsquo;t get any better, KFC has announced intentions to launch its very own smartphone. And yes, it&rsquo;s finger-licking-good.</p>
<p>KFC is teaming up with the tech manufacturers at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei</a> to bring a special edition of the Enjoy 7 Plus to the market. The phone will be KFC branded, sporting the deep red colour that we all know and associate with those big buckets of greasy, fried chicken. Nice&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14402" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wvtom_fwdip0FOxK75W2vkcmRWyuPHjVEZleJh8xZ_OTHH3Qi8E9Wu5HDbO71R2odKQ0KEflVXptE2aDRNP_TSo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, what can you expect from KFC&rsquo;s iPhone killer? Well, the 5.5-inch smartphone will pack 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and will have cool features like a fingerprint scanner. Although it probably won&rsquo;t work if your fingers are coated in chicken grease.</p>
<p>The KFC edition Huawei Enjoy 7 will also house a Snapdragon 425 processor, which means the device will be both quick and slick, just like the staff at your local fried chicken franchise. Best of all, though, it comes with the iconic Colonel Sanders&rsquo; logo laser-engraved onto the back of the phone.</p>

<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough to tempt you, this smartphone from KFC comes with <em>free fried chicken</em>. Um, yeah, you read that right. The device will be pre-loaded with a whopping 100,000 K Dollars (KFC&rsquo;s own currency), which means that you essentially get to use the phone to buy a whole load of deep fried goodness.</p>
<p>What on this fair planet could <em>possibly </em>be better than that? Nothing &mdash;&nbsp;that&rsquo;s what!</p>
<p>Of course, and you probably already guessed this one, there&rsquo;s a downside. KFC and Huawei are only making 5,000 of these limited-edition devices, and they&rsquo;re only available in China right now. That means that laying your hands on one might be a little harder than you imagine right now. Still, they <em>do</em> exist...and, for now, that&rsquo;s enough for us.</p>
