<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We compare iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8, possibly the two best smartphones out right now.</span></p>
<p>Time for a new phone? If you&rsquo;re considering investing in an upgrade, you may well wonder which way to go. Especially with these two major flagship phones hitting stores recently.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a moment to look at what each device has to offer. It&rsquo;s the comparison you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for: iPhone X vs&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note 8.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>With iPhone X, Apple has finally relented and joined the bezeless movement. The screen is larger than that of <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a> (coming in at 5.8 inches) and yet the phone itself is smaller. The screen runs right the way to the edge of the device, offering almost complete coverage that many will love.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has an even larger screen at 6.3 inches, and has an altogether sharper design. The phone is angular and solid. Like the iPhone, it&rsquo;s all screen and then some, which means that you really do get a hefty display.</p>

<p>Oh, and glass is definitely the flavour of the month. Both these flagship smartphones have opted for an all-glass finish on the front and back. The reinforced material should withstand a lot of wear and tear in both cases. iPhone X comes in Silver and Space Grey, whereas the Note 8 comes in Midnight Black and Maple Gold.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Wireless charging is very much the mode of the future and, luckily, with both iPhone X and the Note 8, you get treated to precisely this feature. It&rsquo;s worth noting that, in both cases, you need to buy a wireless charger separately.</p>
<p>Both devices are also somewhat waterproof, with iPhone X rated IP67 and the Note 8 rated IP68.</p>
<p>iPhone X comes with 3D Touch and Live Photos; features that we&rsquo;ve seen on previous models. While many find it hard to get their head around the 3D Touch system, the Live Photos add a novel little twist to the standard picture format.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the heavily-promoted Face ID. This feature lets you unlock your iPhone X simply by looking at it. You can also use this system to authorise Apple Pay transactions, and it&rsquo;s likely that upcoming apps will use it too. Oh, and you can control emoji with it, mimicking your facial expressions.</p>

<p>But enough about iPhone X already, what does Samsung Galaxy Note 8 have to offer? Well, there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;always-on display&rsquo; that shows the time, date, and notifications without you having to wake your device. Then, there&rsquo;s the S-Pen; the unique feature of the Note series and one of the main reasons you may want one. The stylus boasts all sorts of uses, and means you can easily <em>note </em>(see what we did there?) things down.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>When it comes to display, there&rsquo;s not that much in it. iPhone X boasts a 2436 x 1125 screen resolution with a 458 ppi, HDR display. While the Note 8 has a Quad HD Super AMOLED display with a 2960 x 1440 resolution and 521ppi.</p>
<p>Of course, both smartphones will give you more than you need in terms of display quality and resolution. Over the last few years, these devices have come a seriously long way in terms of screen standard, and so you can expect nothing but a top-notch picture from both of them.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Selfie lovers must only be interested in one thing. How do the cameras perform, and which of the two will make you look your prettiest?</p>
<p>In terms of front facing cameras (i.e. selfie cams!), the Note 8 features an 8-megapixel camera and Smart Autofocus. iPhone X&rsquo;s front camera doesn&rsquo;t quite pack as many pixels, with a 7-megapixel lens. However, it does boast Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting, for your edgiest selfies yet.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vC7BAK_1NO8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to rear-facing cameras, iPhone X features a 12-megapixel dual lens camera, dual optical image stabilisation, and quad-LED True Tone flash with slow sync. Add that all to the fact that there&rsquo;s Live Pictures too and you&rsquo;ve got a recipe for some pretty cool snaps.</p>
<p>The Note 8, on the other hand, has a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, along with Live Focus, optical zoom, and Dual Capture. In short, it&rsquo;s a pretty mean camera too.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p>The snazzy new iPhone X comes packed with 3GB RAM and 64GB or 256GB storage. The Note 8 takes things to the next level when it comes to RAM, though, offering a whopping 6GB. It also has storage of 64GB, which you can take up to 256GB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>When it comes to operating systems, you know what to expect. Of course, iPhone X is running the very latest system from Apple: iOS 11. The Note 8 has the powerful Android 7.1 Nougat. Both systems will feel familiar to tech lovers, with a simplistic design and easy to use apps. Which you choose will likely depend on the one you&rsquo;re most comfortable with.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get down to it. Between iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which is the bigger bargain in terms of price?</p>
<p>Well, iPhone X is the more expensive of the two, coming in at &pound;999 for the 64GB model and &pound;1,149 for the 256GB model. The Note 8 comes in a bit cheaper at &pound;869. In both cases, though, it&rsquo;s well worth checking out what options you have on pay-monthly deals, helping you spread the cost.</p>
<p>Or, if you just want the device, you can get Samsung Galaxy Note 8 on 0% finance, paying just &pound;32.58 a month. Likewise, iPhone X is available on finance too, at &pound;43.90 per month (16.9% APR).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which smartphone is right for you? Well, that&rsquo;s entirely up to what you want. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a larger device, complete with a stylus and a lower price tag.</p>
<p>On the other hand, iPhone X <em>is </em>more expensive, but comes with the space-aged Face ID feature and a larger screen than any iPhone before it. Apple fans will no doubt love it.</p>
<p>iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 are so evenly matched, in our opinion, that we think your decision will come down to the operating system, and what you&rsquo;re used to, and most comfortable, using.</p>
