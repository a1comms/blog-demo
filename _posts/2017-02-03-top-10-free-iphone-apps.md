<p>All you need to know is which ones are worth a quick download and which ones you should probably skip. To help you along the way, we&rsquo;ve selected a whopping 10 free iOS apps that you absolutely have to try for yourself.</p>

<p>And now for our best new iPhone apps for February 2017.</p>
<h2>1) 5 Minute Escapes</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13075" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/5-minute-escapes-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the start of the year when we all feel that we really need to get away from just a bit. Sadly, if your finances and busy schedule won&rsquo;t allow for a holiday, that&rsquo;s not always entirely possible. The 5 Minute Escapes iPhone app aims to give you a chance to spend just (you guessed it) five minutes in utter bliss. Complete with relaxing music, sound effects, and a little &lsquo;guided visualisation&rsquo;, you should find that this nifty little app allows you to get the little bit of rest bite that you so desperately need on a day to day basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5-minute-escapes-guided-meditation/id1148380781?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download 5 Minute Escapes free on iPhone</a></p>
<h2>2) Filmborn</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13076" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/filmborn-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who is always filming little videos and clips on their phone, we might just have something for you. The app is supposedly &ldquo;designed to bridge the analog history of film with its digital future&rdquo;. What that means is that you&rsquo;re able to create videos that look as though they were filmed using old fashioned techniques, even though you simply shot them on your phone. Easy, right? While this app is by no means going to revolutionize the way you make videos, it does give you access to a world of new filters and shooting styles.</p>

<h2>3) YEAY</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yFuC41Pl6Y" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Free iPhone apps that allow you to &lsquo;buy and sell&rsquo; things are not particularly new. Of course, the classic site and app is eBay, but over the last few years we&rsquo;ve seen newcomers, such as Shpock, become massively popular too. You might be thinking that there&rsquo;s not a whole lot a new app can bring to this already saturated area, but you <em>could </em>be wrong. YEAY is a standard buying and selling app with just one little twist - it lets you use video to sell your things. What that means is that rather than checking out a few snaps of the product before you hit that &lsquo;buy&rsquo; button, you can watch a clip of the piece in action. Nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yeay-buy-and-sell-with-video/id1070699048?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download YEAY free on iPhone</a></p>
<h2>4) Snapsie</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13077" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/snapsie-take-progress-pictures-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>With the new year finally taking grip, you&rsquo;ll notice just one thing; everyone is trying to shape up. Whether you&rsquo;re hoping to lose that excess Christmas weight or get &lsquo;bikini ready&rsquo; for the summer, it&rsquo;s never all that easy to stick to your diet and exercise plan. One of the reasons that so many people try and ultimately fail to reach their weight goals is because they refuse to keep track of their progress. That&rsquo;s where Snapsie comes into things. The idea is that you take a photo of yourself every single day so that you can physically see the weight dropping. At the end of your journey (i.e. when you&rsquo;re totally in shape!), you can share the before and after pics on social media.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapsie-take-progress-pictures/id1180244595?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download Snapsie free on iPhone</a></p>

<h2>5) FaceRig</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnHiJOi5e6I" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Want to make videos and pictures a tad more interesting (or simply conceal your identity)? Well, then this one&rsquo;s for you. FaceRig is fairly similar to the likes of MSQRD in that it allows you to control a virtual reality character using your face. Once you start using this essential iPhone app, you&rsquo;ll have access to a whole load of different characters, from a cute fox to a rather bizarre looking hamburger man. When you move, so does the character and you can take videos or snaps along the way. This is not a massively useful app - it won&rsquo;t help you with your productivity or anything like that. However, for pure novelty value, it might be worth a cheeky download.</p>
<p>>> Download FaceRig free on iPhone</p>
<h2>6) Onefootball</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13078" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/onefootball-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>Although you&rsquo;d likely enjoy watching your favourite team every single time they play, that&rsquo;s not always possible. We all have lives and jobs, which means that there are rare occasions when you just can&rsquo;t head to the pub and watch <em>your </em>team in action. So, what do you do? Well, most fans simply look things up on the internet when they are out and about, but there might be an easier way to keep up with the latest scores. Onefootball is a free iOS app that gives you to-the-moment updates about the teams you choose. When you first set the app up, you just need to choose the teams that you want to &lsquo;follow&rsquo; and then you will get notifications for them every match day. Score!</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/onefootball-football-scores/id382002079?mt=8">>> Download Onefootball free on iPhone</a></p>

<h2>7) You, Me, Paris</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13079" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/you-me-paris-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re heading to the city of love anytime soon, You, Me, Paris is the must-have travel guide app. Download this little beauty and you should be able to find all the hotspots in no time at all. There are five different categories; Just for Two, Hotels, Restaurants and Bars, Shopping, and Culture. Simply choose the right category for you and start browsing. There are also themed walking tours of the city, which means you can blissfully wander the streets of Paris without ever fearing that you&rsquo;ll get lost along the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/you-me-paris/id1186801254?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download You, Me, Paris free on iPhone</a></p>
<h2>8) REVL</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hsnfELv-00" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Trying to find interesting events near you is never all that easy. With many sites and apps out there, it can be rather tricky to find things that you&rsquo;re particularly interested in online. Let&rsquo;s face it, trying to sift through the endless events listings on any given site is anything but fun. That&rsquo;s where REVL comes into the picture. The app has 19 interest categories, which means that you can select one that really does suit your interests! Aside from listings, the app also offers a &lsquo;news&rsquo; function, which means that you will find out about events in your area as soon as they&rsquo;re announced.</p>
<p>>> Download REVL free on iPhone</p>

<h2>9) WeatherWheel</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13080" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/weather-wheel-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one reason that you ought to grab this weather app as opposed to any other: It&rsquo;s a whole lot of fun. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the app, you will see an image of the globe, with famous landmarks highlighted. You can actually spin the wheel and see the weather change in real time. So, if you want to see how sunny it is in New York right now, there&rsquo;s never been an easier way. Just turn the wheel until you see the Statue of Liberty and check out that glorious sunshine. Of course, the app also has weather predictions for the next few days too.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weatherwheel/id687782892?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download WeatherWheel free on iPhone</a></p>
<h2>10) Gifs Art</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13081" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/gifs-art-app-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve got a spare minute, this little app is a fun way to pass the time. There&rsquo;s no real reason that you would <em>need </em>to create your own gifs, but you might just want to all the same. Gifs Art is an easy-to-use app that allows you to make funky gifs out of your personal photos. There are loads of ways you can customise your individual gifs, from stickers and text to effects and masks. Once you&rsquo;ve finished editing your gifs, you can share them to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Twitter at just the click of a button. Honestly, nothing could be easier!</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gifs-art-by-picsart-gifs-video/id1063953163?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Download Gifs Art free on iPhone</a></p>

<h2>1) Super Mario Run</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTglyDBdp-A" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Words honestly cannot describe how excited I am about the release of Super Mario Run.</p>
<p>Arguably the best platform game of all time (yeah, I said it!) has finally landed for iPhone users. The free iOS app is a side-scrolling, auto-running video game. What that means is Mario runs without any prompting. You just have to tap the screen to make him jump.</p>
<p>Mario Run is actually a whole lot harder than it sounds since the action keeps moving no matter what you do. You can play in either Rally (where you challenge other players) or Tour (where you don&rsquo;t) mode. Eek. Good luck saving Princess Peach, guys!</p>
<p>Download Mario Run free on iOS.</p>
<h2>2) The Snow Fox</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12769" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/the-snow-fox-app.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="531" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one for all the parents out there. The Snow Fox is essentially an interactive story that you read along with your little ones. As you read the story, you'll see that the illustrations come to life as well. As far as free iPhone apps go, this one is seriously impressive and well put together. Plus, it's certain to make your kids&rsquo; bedtime stories a lot more fun!</p>
<p>Download The Snow Fox free on iOS.</p>

<h2>3) Corkscrew</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12770" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/corkscrew.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="529" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, while we all know that certain wines pair with certain dishes, few of us are actually experts in this field.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to look foolish when ordering a bottle of vino at some fancy restaurant, Corkscrew is the app for you. All you have to do is input the meal that you plan to have, and the app will recommend the very best wine to complement your food.</p>
<p>Corkscrew is an app that'll make you look like something of a connoisseur, even though you're preference is normally as simple as red or white.</p>
<p>Download Corkscrew free on iOS.</p>
<h2>4) Bookout</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12771" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/bookout.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="529" /></p>
<p>If you spend more time watching Netflix than you do reading a decent book, here&rsquo;s the app for you.</p>
<p>The main aim of Bookout is to get users to dedicate more time to reading on a daily or even weekly basis. You can set goals for how much you want to read each month and log the time that you actually spend deep in the pages of your favourite novel.</p>
<p>This is one of those free iPhone apps that actually helps you track your progress too. You can see your stats within Bookout and adjust your aims too.</p>
<p>Download Bookout free on iOS.</p>

<h2>5) Kitchen Stories</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgAW5--7yvs" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a culinary mastermind to use this app. In fact, pretty much anybody can download and use Kitchen Stories to help improve cooking skills.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sick of making the same tired old recipes again and again, this new iOS app has a whole load of inspiration just for you. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s totally free to boot!</p>
<p>Downloaded Kitchen Stories and you'll have access to a range of recipes (duh!), how-to video tutorials and step-by-step photo guides. There are new recipes every single week so you won't ever get bored of eating the same stodgy lasagne again!</p>
<p>Download Kitchen Stories free on iOS.</p>
<h2>6) Kahoot!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12772" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/kahoot.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>Learning is so not something that stops when you finish school, or even university. If you want to keep your mind as sharp as possible (who doesn&rsquo;t?), you should probably download Kahoot! right about now.</p>
<p>Here, you can create your own &lsquo;learning games&rsquo; and play others that people have made as well. The entire idea behind it is that you learn as you play quiz-type games. It&rsquo;s all about making learning fun.</p>
<p>These short and easy-to-access quizzes are ideal for when you&rsquo;re waiting for the bus or queuing in Primark. Plus, you might just expand your general knowledge!</p>
<p>Download Kahoot! free on iOS.</p>

<h2>7) Catch the Bus</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BF_gGeLDKE" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s hard for any of the new iOS apps to rival the likes of Super Mario Run. It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. Still, Catch the Bus is a simple little side-scrolling game that'll help waste your free time.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that your little character is late for his bus, and needs to run to reach it. There are obstacles in his way, though, and you need to jump over them (i.e. tap the screen) if he&rsquo;s going to make it on time. Consume energy drinks along the way to boost your obstacle tackling powers!</p>
<p>Download Catch the Bus free on iOS.</p>
<h2>8) Wine n Dine</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12773" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/wine-n-dine.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="527" /></p>
<p>In short, Wine n Dine is an app that reveals where the best restaurants in the world are and what you should eat there. Unlike TripAdvisor, it is not spammed full of negative reviews from customers. Instead, it&rsquo;s a place where people can tell you what they really, honestly liked about particular restaurants and recommend specific dishes on the menu. What&rsquo;s more, Wine n Dine partnered with the Resy app, which means that you can actually reserve a table while using it. Perfect.</p>
<p>Download Wine n Dine free on iOS.</p>

<h2>9) G. Spotting</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12774" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/g-spotting.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="532" /></p>
<p>No, this isn't what you're thinking..! In case you hadn&rsquo;t heard, Gwyneth Paltrow has her own (immensely popular) lifestyle site. This is the latest in a long line of celebrity-endorsed, free iOS apps, but it&rsquo;s one that you might actually want to download.</p>
<p>Spotting is honestly very useful when you&rsquo;re sightseeing in a new city. The app includes guides for the likes of London, New York, and Los Angeles, to name but a few. Within each guide, there are also expert recommendations for cafes, restaurants, shops, and cultural spots too.</p>
<p>Download G. Spotting free on iOS.</p>
<h2>10) Darkr</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12775" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/darkr.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" /></p>
<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s a little something for all you photography buffs. If you yearn for times gone by, when the <em>real </em>art of photography was about developing film in a darkroom, you will absolutely adore this new iOS app!</p>
<p>Basically, Darkr uses old-school development tricks (like burning and dodging) to create some truly unique digital pictures. The app is 100% free and pretty simple to use once you get your head around it. It's certainly worth a try!</p>
<p>Download Darkr free on iOS.</p>
