<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple&rsquo;s Tim Cook has gone on record, saying that the new iPhones will tempt a lot of Android users over to the iOS platform. Join us as we take a look at whether that&rsquo;s likely to happen, or whether there are other factors beyond the new, bigger screens on the new, bigger iPhones, which might make people stick with Google&rsquo;s OS...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5340 aligncenter" alt="Apple vs Android - can the new iPhones take on Google" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/BM-Blog-OS-1024x611.png" width="960" height="572" /></p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing you can guarantee, whenever a new iPhone gets unveiled, it&rsquo;s that the smartphone wars will heat up again. It happens every single time, with both Apple and Android fans settling down into their respective trenches, ready to throw barbs at each other.</p>
<p>This year, however, thing may end up being a little bit different, or at least, that&rsquo;s what Apple&rsquo;s Tim Cook believes. Speaking in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Cook says that he expects Android users to take a good look at the two new iPhones (namely, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus), with an eye to jumping ship, and go with Apple.</p>
<p>Is that going to be the case, however, or are most Android fans too invested in Google&rsquo;s platform to make the jump?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p>
<h2>The case against: investment in a platform</h2>
<p>The obvious answer here is that one simply needs to scour the many forums of the internet and look at the usual comments coming from zealous fans on <i>both</i> sides of the Android-iOS iron curtain. While those are merely the most vocals fans of both platforms, there&rsquo;s an argument to be made that quite a lot of smartphone users won&rsquo;t be prepared to switch.</p>
<p>The big reason <em>why</em> they might not be prepared to switch is less to do with brand loyalty, and more to do with <i>apps</i>. Put simply, if one were to jump from Android to iOS, one would have to buy all of one&rsquo;s apps again, an extra expense that a fair number of people might not be prepared to stomach.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&rsquo;d hazard a guess and say that a lot of Android users might want to stick with phones such as the LG G3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5, since the range of <em>first-party</em> Google apps is so compelling.</p>
<h2>The case for: Apple has actually made it a lot easier to switch</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if one takes apps out of the equation, Apple has actually done a lot to make it easier to switch to the iPhone 6 (or the iPhone 6 Plus, if you prefer bigger phones). Not only do you have the new, bigger screens on both models (Android users really do like big screens), but you&rsquo;ve got a seemingly easier-to-use mobile payment system in Apple Pay, and there&rsquo;s also a new utility to make it an absolute doddle to transfer things like contacts list to your new iPhone.</p>
<p>With these things, Apple has, in a sense, closed the gap between the two platforms, making it easier than ever to jump from one to the other.</p>
<h2>So, what will happen?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to predict whether we&rsquo;ll see a huge influx of former Android users migrate to the iOS ecosystem, but we&rsquo;re going to go out on a limb and say that yes, we <em>will</em> see at least a few people jump ship, and head over into Apple&rsquo;s stable. Apple&rsquo;s done a <em>lot</em> to make that transition as easy as possible, so we can definitely imagine a fair few Android users giving the idea some serious thought.</p>
<p>However, the reason why it&rsquo;s so hard to predict how many will make the jump is simply that they&rsquo;d have to buy all their apps again. Still, that uncertainty is what makes life exciting, so we can&rsquo;t wait to see how this one plays out!</p>
