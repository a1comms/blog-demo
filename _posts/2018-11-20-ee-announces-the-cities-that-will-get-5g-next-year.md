<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The future is coming!</span></p>
<p>The new year is only around the corner now and you may well be looking forward to what 2019 has in store. While we don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball (sorry!), we do know one thing for sure.</p>
<p>If you happen to be an EE customer, there&rsquo;s one thing that next year is sure to bring. Yes, the network has just announced that it will be rolling out 5G in many UK cities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Get ready to say hello to 5G!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re launching 5G in 16 UK cities in 2019, including the busiest locations across London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham and Manchester. And that&rsquo;s just the start. <a href="https://t.co/xbwgRd7OYL">pic.twitter.com/xbwgRd7OYL</a></p>

<h2>What Is 5G and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard all the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/get-ready-for-5g-data-speeds-as-ee-announces-first-uk-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hype about 5G</a>, but do you actually know what it means? Nope? Okay, well you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s a quick explanation.</p>
<p>Since the advent of mobile networks, there have been a range of improvements. Each time a new generation of network comes out, it is faster and, essentially, has more capacity. To put that in perspective, 5G is the fifth generation of mobile internet, which means that it&rsquo;s certain to be the speediest out right now. Nice!</p>
<p>One of the main things that you need to know about 5G is that it uses a higher frequency than previous incarnations of the network. That means that whether you&rsquo;re making calls, sending texts, or using the internet, everything will be slicker and quicker.</p>

<h2>EE Launches 5G in the Busiest UK Cities</h2>
<p>Are you an EE customer? Great. You might be wondering when you can start using 5G. The answer will depend on where you happen to live in this fine country. The company just <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/features-and-articles/its-official-ee-to-launch-5g-across-16-uk-cities-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be bringing the latest generation of mobile internet to 16 cities across the UK in 2019. Those lucky cities will include busy locations such as London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham and, of course, Manchester too.</p>
<p>So, should you happen to live in any of these places, you&rsquo;re sure to have speedier internet, calls, texts, and more before you know it. Of course, right now, we don&rsquo;t know the exact date that the 5G network will be launching. However, the chances are that we will learn more before the end of the year. Watch this space.</p>

<h2>5G: The Mobile Network of the Future</h2>
<p>When 5G launches, it will make your smartphone a whole lot faster than it is now. However, the power of this generation won&rsquo;t end there. The 5G service will also be used to support a range of SmartThings, i.e. tablets, wearables, and more. As the world of technology grows, there&rsquo;s likely to be no end to the possibilities that await us. So, could 5G be the mobile network of the future? Well, yes. It most certainly will be.</p>
