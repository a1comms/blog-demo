<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">In previous articles, we took an introductory look at mobile broadband, and then drilled down into the detail to see why mobile broadband is safer and more secure than public WiFi, if you want to access the internet on the go.</span></p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to look in a bit more detail at which package might be best for you, by taking a look at how much data you might actually need. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at 5 distinct types of user, to see how much data each one might need...</p>
<p>(Note: all usage estimates are based on one device being connected. If you use more (as a family, for example), increase these estimates accordingly!)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">[mks_icon icon="fa-facebook-square" color="#0896d5" type="fa"]</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">The Light User</span></h3>
<p>The light user, as the name suggests, doesn&rsquo;t do a great deal online. They may browse a few sites here and there, send the odd email or check their friends&rsquo; Facebook updates now and then, and watch the odd video on YouTube, but their usage is definitely not heavy. In that situation, a rough estimate for how much data used is around 400-500MB per month, so a 1GB package could well be all they need.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">[mks_icon icon="icon-users" color="#f4c31e" type="sl"]</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;"><span style="color: #0896d5;">The Social Butterfly</span><br />
</span></h3>
<p>The social butterfly probably about the same amount of time browsing the web each month, but spends a lot more time on Facebook or Twitter, always keeping up to date with what their friends are doing, updating their on status, or talking on things like Skype. Their usage is estimated around 1.2GB per month, so a 1.5GB package would cover their needs nicely.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">[mks_icon icon="icon-call-out" color="#3a3839" type="sl"]</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">The Mobile Worker<br />
</span></h3>
<p>With the mobile worker, the biggest data usage will likely be in the form of emails, both sent and received, and those may contain a lot of attachments. There may also be some social usage (as many businesses use Twitter and Facebook for promotion), plus some browsing, although likely less than someone using the net just for fun. Thus, the mobile worker uses around 732MB per month, and would be covered with a 1GB package.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">[mks_icon icon="icon-social-youtube" color="#086189" type="sl"]</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #de007d;">The Media Consumer<br />
</span></h3>
<p>Emails and social use are likely to be low on the list of priorities here, with the vast majority of data used being in the form of video and music streaming/downloads. However, those are among the most data-intensive things one can do, so the usage here is estimated at around 13.2GB. So, the suggested plan for the media consumer is a 20GB package.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0896d5;">[mks_icon icon="icon-game-controller" color="#e59233" type="sl"]</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0896d5;">The Gamer</span></h3>
<p>The gamer is a little bit of a complex choice, as the usage can vary wildly, depending on several factors. They are also likely to watch more (gaming videos on Youtube), and browse more reputable gaming news sites. Based on that, the usage is estimated around 5.1GB per month, indicating a 10GB package should suffice.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&rsquo;t take into account the downloading of games through Steam, so if you do that a lot, take that into account (some games have huge downloads; Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor, for instance, is a 43GB download, which would be way outside your data bundle).</p>
<p>So bear that in mind when choosing the right package for your needs!</p>
