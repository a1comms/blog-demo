<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&ldquo;OK Google, what&rsquo;s the best smart home speaker?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Not got on the smart speaker train, yet? Well, what on earth are you waiting for? Whether you just want a superb speaker system for your home or your very own virtual assistant, there&rsquo;s so much that these devices can offer.</p>
<p>So, which is the best smart speaker for you? After all, we don't want you going out their and making the wrong decision. Lets find out who wins: Apple HomePod vs. Amazon Echo vs. Google Home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16533" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7E8fuU5OXBsTJwNZNEuGAv_1Wy0jCoyAWNmaDQ6zF0r1lhb9QWuEZE7elXvcJdVTlnAj6ujWLi8UwiQNkh3PHnbA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Sound Quality</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just looking for a speaker to be&hellip; well, a speaker, you&rsquo;re going to want to know a thing or two about the sound quality first. Google Home is the least powerful of the three with a 2-inch driver. The Echo, on the other hand, has two separate speakers; a woofer and a tweeter. For a long time, it reigned supreme as having the best speaker system out there.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_16555" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-16555 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zvSWyNnj5m3gMjLfoH4Z8XMcknYOMP3GOifM6cz-yvSZCvBQGC9PBysnjo691Zf0p6TaPwn7EGZETlrXtg2IDb4=s0" alt="" width="600" height="370" /> Amazon Echo[/caption]</p>
<p>But, of course, the Apple HomePod has come to shake things up for everyone. Packed with its own woofer and seven beamforming tweeters, you can expect great things from its sound. Apple has done a great job pitching the HomePod as a music-playing device, so this is where it really does excel.</p>

<p>Bring the noise, Apple HomePod takes the points here.</p>
<p>Our score: Apple HomePod: 1 | Amazon Echo: 0 | Google Home: 0</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Each of the speakers works with their own specific set of services. Of course, if you happen to subscribe to Amazon Prime, you should find that you can reap many rewards by using the Echo. The device pairs with your membership, meaning that you can listen to your Amazon Music Unlimited playlist all day long.</p>
<p>Google Home pairs with your Chromecast, making it super easy to use the device as an external speaker for your TV. Perfect for when you want to watch Netflix or, indeed, YouTube. Finally, both Google Home and the HomePod offer IFTTT support, which means that your smart devices can be paired and communicate with one another.</p>
<p>It's a share of the points here. One a piece goes to Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Our score: Apple HomePod: 2 | Amazon Echo: 0 | Google Home: 1</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>When it comes to having a good, old chit-chat (or rather, asking your speaker some of life&rsquo;s most pressing questions), like, &ldquo;hey Google, where&rsquo;s Wally", there&rsquo;s a clear winner. While the Amazon Echo finds it hard to answer some questions, Google Home always knows what to say.</p>
<p>One of the best things about this particular smart speaker is that it has access to Google, right off the bat. That means that, no matter what you happen to ask it, it can quickly search for the answer.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s unclear how the HomePod will do. We know that it uses Siri, which doesn&rsquo;t bode all that well for it. However, who knows, it may surprise us and link with a great system to answer whatever crazy little question pops into our heads.</p>
<p>Hey Google, how many points do you have? Google Home takes the point here.</p>
<p>Our score: Apple HomePod: 2 | Amazon Echo: 0 | Google Home: 2</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Of course, no one wants an ugly old speaker taking up space in their living room. So, when it comes to design, which is the best smart speaker?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Amazon Echo; the standard issue look is sleek, black, and has a ring of colourful lights around the top of it. It&rsquo;s a classic design and inoffensive, at the best of times. It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a few variants to this available online, from the faux walnut look to the pure white design. The choices are plentiful.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_16531" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-16531 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u9LIkgJsstWzVP_yZ86duevq7-JpLk49-qfbwVs_l-dUTUYl_XrVfzXkj7RLOBvrjtnnFH3LAX5vIacifhzX8HA=s0" alt="" width="600" height="422" /> Amazon Echo[/caption]</p>
<p>Google Home is a little slicker, with a heavy base and white finish. Plus, if you&rsquo;re into personalising the speaker, you could grab some coloured fabric or metallic bases, for a small extra charge. Neat.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_16530" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-16530 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g6a2SyuI2j8ICeC1VnZ6ioROygycHZHDr1n7pZjEHe9c0koEOv7QNs0LTLOE_H6qmjEIItXlXzN0qiEjfOejFFhU=s0" alt="" width="600" height="335" /> Google Home[/caption]</p>
<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the HomePod. While the design is rather space-aged, there&rsquo;s no getting away from the fact that it kind of looks a bit blobby. Apple&rsquo;s minimalist style is intact here, with a mesh-covered exterior and little else. You&rsquo;d hardly notice it in your home. And maybe that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_16537" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-16537 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/e_OV4Fbh62atiuB6EF1PkMJNktWOEDeui9D_Ac3ZKegEhr37DN_UNU-UsBvNq99ID5A8bQjqHQqkky8e6eDzE2H1=s0" alt="" width="600" height="300" /> Apple HomePod[/caption]</p>
<p>The pick of the bunch, it has to be the Apple HomePod for us. One point to Apple.</p>
<p>Our score: Apple HomePod: 3 | Amazon Echo: 0 | Google Home: 2</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Of course, when deciding on which smart speaker to get, there&rsquo;s one thing that you must not overlook &ndash; the price. This is sure to be a major factor for many people and, frankly, so it should be.</p>
<p>When the HomePod comes out, it will set you back &pound;319; much more than other smart speakers. The Amazon Echo costs &pound;89.99 right now (although it was originally &pound;119.99!) and you can often get deals online too. Google Home plays it safe in the middle, with a &pound;129 price tag.</p>
<p>A bargain in comparison, it's the Amazon Echo that wins on price.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, with all of the above in mind, which smart speaker should you choose? Well, that really depends on what you want from it. While each device is similar, they each have their pros and cons too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re after a snazzy, high-quality speaker and love all things Apple, the HomePod may well be the way to go. Then again, if you want a budget home speaker, the Amazon Echo is also a fine option. And, if you want a mid-range product that can answer your every whim, Google Home is sure to impress. The choice, as they say, is yours.</p>
<p>3rd Place: Amazon Echo</p>
<p>2nd place:Google Home</p>
<p>With a score of three, our winner: Apple HomePod.</p>
