<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-8228 noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8228 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/rumours-s7.png" alt="The new samsung galaxy rumours" width="600" height="100" /></a><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">According to the latest, we&rsquo;re less than one month away from Samsung unveiling the next generation of Galaxy flagships, the Galaxy S7.</span></p>
<p>Dubbed Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge &ndash; <em>naturally</em> &ndash; these two smartphones are reportedly gearing for a launch at, or just prior to MWC 2016 (22-25 Feb).</p>
<p>For months, pockets of the web have been thriving with rumours and speculation, postulating the kind of features and specs that might soon surface.</p>
<p>Using these titbits, we&rsquo;ve pulled together a picture of what Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge might look like. As always, remember that everything here is gleaned from unofficial sources, and can only be treated as rumour.</p>
<h2>Release Date</h2>
<p>Traditionally, Samsung has used MWC has a platform for showing off the latest flagships in the Galaxy family, so it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet that 2016 will follow the trend. The official announcement will likely come the day before MWC officially starts, on 21<sup>st</sup> February, according to Tech Radar<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Last year we saw Samsung adopt a new (and welcomed) approach to design, introducing two all-metal-and-glass smartphones in Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. The changes were so radical from previous, plastic models, that we can&rsquo;t see Samsung upgrading this department this soon, beyond a few tweaks here and there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8215" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6.jpg alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy S7 to look similar to the Galaxy S6&rdquo;>" width="650" height="365" /></p>
<p>Whilst it might not have any bearing on appearance, it&rsquo;s possible that Samsung is engineering the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge with IP67 certification<sup>1</sup>, making them dust and waterproof like Samsung Galaxy S5. The body is likely to be sealed, which means you won&rsquo;t be able to swap the battery out for a fully charged one. Sad face.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Will Samsung take the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium on, with its pixel-rich 4K display? We don&rsquo;t think so, especially not for the Galaxy S7, which we believe will sport a 5.1-inch screen<sup>1</sup>. It&rsquo;s possible the Galaxy S7 edge might wield a 4K display, as the rumours suggest it&rsquo;s going to be a 5.7-inch beast<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8217" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-display.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-display.jpg alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to feature a 5.7-inch Quad HD display&rdquo;>" width="800" height="427" /></p>
<p>We think both are more likely to house a Quad HD display, with new, integrated screen technology<sup>1</sup> that responds to the pressure of your finger, much like Apple&rsquo;s 3D Touch feature on iPhone 6s. If you haven&rsquo;t seen 3D Touch in operation, it essentially brings a few shortcuts to your apps, without having to actually open them. You just press a little harder on an app icon to launch new commands.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p><strong>*Controversy warning*</strong></p>
<p>Venture Beat<sup>2</sup> is claiming that&nbsp;Samsung is ditching the 16MP camera used in its Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, for a&hellip; wait for it&hellip; 12MP shooter with lower pixel capturing capability. How dare they, right?</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. We&rsquo;ve backed iPhones over the years even though their cameras have seemingly low megapixel counts. Why? Because they always produce fantastic results irrespective of this figure. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not all about pixels, but rather elements like image translating software and aperture size.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8218" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-camera.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-camera.jpg alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy S7 to feature a 12MP camera with a bigger aperture&rdquo;>" width="800" height="454" /></p>
<p>Speaking of which, we hear Samsung Galaxy S7 is in for a larger aperture<sup>2</sup> (f/1.7) that&rsquo;ll significantly improve low light performance. There&rsquo;s also an opportunity to improve camera reaction speed, potentially rivalling Sony Xperia Z5&rsquo;s 0.03 second auto focus.</p>
<p>Whether this will tie in with the pressure-sensitive screen as is the case on iPhone 6s, we don&rsquo;t know, but there&rsquo;s plenty of speculation claiming that Samsung is working on its own iteration of Live Photos, a feature that brings your photos to life by recording 1.5 seconds before and after you press capture. According to one Samsung engineer, this&rsquo;ll be called &lsquo;Vivid Photos&rsquo;<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<h2>Power and Battery</h2>
<p>Samsung, a constant force to be reckoned with when it comes to performance, will no doubt pump the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge full of the very best tech available. It&rsquo;s looking like they&rsquo;ll house either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820<sup>1</sup> or Exynos 8990<sup>2</sup> chipset, coupled with a mighty 4GB RAM<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8219" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-performance.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-edge-performance.jpg alt=&rdquo;Gaming on Samsung Galaxy S7 will be run beautifully&rdquo;>" width="800" height="463" /></p>
<p>Apparently these devices will feature advanced liquid cooling technology<sup>1</sup>, to prevent the phone from overheating at times of high activity, and prevent any excessive strains on battery life. According to some opinions, Samsung Galaxy S7 is expected to house a 3000mAh battery<sup>2</sup> (up from 2550mAh), and the Galaxy S7 edge a 3600mAh unit<sup>2</sup> (up from 2600mAh). Of course, the S7 edge will need the extra juice to cope with added screen size.</p>
<p>Like their predecessors, the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones will probably feature wireless charging. However, as a new addition, they may ditch the microUSB charging ports for USB Type-C<sup>1</sup>. Like Lightning ports on newer iPhones, USB Type-C charging cables can be inserted either way. No more awkward fumbling around in the dark.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>There are a number of safe assumptions we can make, like a fingerprint scanner that&rsquo;s integrated into the home button, and the availability of both 32GB and 64GB storage options. Interestingly, though, rumour has it that there won&rsquo;t be a 128GB variant<sup>1</sup>, but the smaller versions will feature a microSD card slot with support for a 200GB microSD<sup>2</sup> card&hellip; A fair trade? We think so.</p>
