<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Hackers are watching you in your underpants.</span></p>
<p>This week, social media mogul Mark Zuckerberg shared a photo to Facebook, celebrating yet another astronomical milestone for the number of active Instagram users.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Instagram&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;that was so curious.</p>
<p>On a closer inspection of the photo, more observant people than I noticed that the Facebook CEO has taped over both his laptop&rsquo;s webcam and microphone.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10102910644965951%26set%3Da.612287952871.2204760.4%26type%3D3&amp;width=500" width="600" height="670" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This raises two questions. Why? And should I do the same?</p>
<p>As a talented programmer, Zuckerberg likely has some experience (or at least, some understanding) around computer hacking, which means he&rsquo;s likely covered up his webcam and microphone as a cautionary measure.</p>
<p>In other words, Zuck doesn&rsquo;t want those damn Winklevoss twins eavesdropping in.</p>

<p>FBI Director James Comey does exactly the same thing, reasoning &ldquo;I saw somebody smarter than I am had piece of tape over their camera.&rdquo; If that doesn&rsquo;t ring alarm bells, I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>
<p>You may not be aware, but clever and mischievous hackers can (and have) access&nbsp;computer webcams and microphones, placing us under unlawful and unauthorised surveillance. And there&rsquo;s not a lot you can do about it&hellip;</p>
<h2>How hackers target your webcam</h2>
<p>Webcams usually come in two variants: one that connects to your computer directly, and one that connects indirectly over WiFi.</p>
<p>Those that connect over WiFi typically have their own IP address, which technically allows you (or someone else&hellip; *looks over shoulder*) to connect from anywhere in the world. Of course, Internet-connected webcams can be password protected, but users have been known to leave it set to the default. Hackers rub their filthy hands at the thought.</p>
<p>Computer-connected webcams, like the ones that sit at the top of laptop screens, can pose more of a challenge to would-be hackers. To access these, they would need to first infect your computer with malware, by setting some sort of digital snare, dressed up as an alluring link or an email filled with empty promises. I&rsquo;m still waiting for those pills&hellip;</p>
<p>But in either scenario, the truth is simple: your computer is at risk.</p>
<p>Sure, you can do your best to set complex passwords, avoid sketchy websites and delete nefarious-looking emails, but there&rsquo;s no sure-fire, totally bullet-proof method of keeping snooping hackers from dropping in as you sit clad in your underpants, flicking through Donald Trump memes on your laptop. It&rsquo;s a terrifying thought.</p>
<p>But, amazingly, for all of technology&rsquo;s wonderfully advanced capabilities, it seems the best solution is to literally tape over your webcam and microphone&hellip; kind of like shutting the door on someone's face and telling them to bugger off.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes the old ways are the best, I guess.</strong></p>
