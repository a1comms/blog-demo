<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>This VR game has been created to immerse us Fantastic Beasts fans into the wizarding world first hand, through the increasingly popular medium of VR for smartphone.</p>
<p>The cinematic and beautiful experience lets you meet and interact with six of the beasts from the popular 2016 movie, complete spells and absorb some magic from the comfort of your living room.</p>
<p>In the game, along with a few others, you'll meet the creatures from the film, including: a Bowtruckle, Erumpant, Niffler and Thunderbird.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The game is centred around you and your view of the Fantastic Beasts world. But, what can you do?</p>
<p>Well, from inside Newt Scamander&rsquo;s case, you&rsquo;ll get to work your magic and wave your wand, learning spells and taming creatures. Essentially, the stuff that helps assist the Ministry of Magic and the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures (a note for the muggles among us - that&rsquo;s who Newt Scamander works for).</p>
