<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple, the Cupertino based tech giant, fought off competition from the likes of Nike and Aston Martin, to top the CoolBrands list for its third consecutive year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5349 aligncenter" alt="Apple tops the CoolBrands list" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Santa-Monica-store-1024x681.jpg" width="960" height="638" /><span class="caption">Image: Apple adopts a minimalist design for its stores; some may even say they look 'cool'.

<p>Tech brands tend to rank highly in the minds of consumers, in terms of the &lsquo;cool factor&rsquo;, with an impressive eight featuring in this year&rsquo;s top 20.</p>
<p>Twitter, however, dropped out of the sky after three years of flying high on the CoolBrands list, whilst brands like Instagram and NetFlix made their debuts.</p>
<p>The annual survey draws in votes from 2,000 consumers and an &lsquo;Expert Council&rsquo; that consists of 37 members, including the likes of David Harewood, Tom Findlay and Ella Eyra.</p>
<p>Stephen Cheliotis, a spokesman for CoolBrands, said: &ldquo;This year's rankings illustrate that a solid reputation is hard to undermine or, in the case of rivals, overcome.</p>
<p>"That said, it was refreshing to see unique and original brands such as Instagram and Netflix join the top 20.</p>
<p>"Both have had an impact on the market, shaking up the status quo and forcing rivals to up the ante.</p>
<p>"Apple, however, continues to dominate the listing and remains untouchable for now."</p>
<p>Apple is still riding the wave of success after unveiling its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which no doubt helped it outshine the plethora of other popular brands on the CoolBrands list.</p>
<p>The full list is below:</p>
<p>1. Apple</p>
<p>2. Aston Martin</p>
<p>3. Nike</p>
<p>4. Chanel</p>
<p>5. Glastonbury</p>
<p>6. Google</p>
<p>7. YouTube</p>
<p>8. Dom Perignon</p>
<p>9. Rolex</p>
<p>10. Netflix</p>
<p>11. Bang &amp; Olufsen</p>
<p>12. Ray-Ban</p>
<p>13. Alexander McQueen</p>
<p>14. Instagram</p>
<p>15. Bose</p>
<p>16. Liberty</p>
<p>17. Selfridges</p>
<p>18. Sony</p>
<p>19. Virgin Atlantic</p>
