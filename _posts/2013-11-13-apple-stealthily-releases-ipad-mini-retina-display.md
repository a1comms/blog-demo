<p><span class="postStandFirst">It looks as though Apple has broken the habit of a lifetime by beginning selling one of its products unaccompanied by the avalanche of hype we&rsquo;ve come to associate with the firm.</span></p>
<p>A 7.9-inch iPad Mini stealthily appeared on the Cupertino firm&rsquo;s online store this morning (Tuesday 12 November) after the site went offline for a few hours, a move that experience tells us Apple makes each time it makes a new product available to the tech-hungry hoards of i-Fanatics.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5788" alt="10834316116_094fa729f8" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/10834316116_094fa729f8.jpg" width="500" height="465" /></p>
<p>The mystery shrouding the device sale is especially surprising given that Apple only announced the iPad Mini 7.9 and larger iPad Air at the end of October and wouldn&rsquo;t give a concrete date for the tiny i-Slate to hit shelves.</p>
<p>Whilst the iPad Air was made commercially available a couple of weeks back, Apple was recently reported to be suffering supply issues for the smaller device. Taking into consideration both this and the fact that Tim Cook&rsquo;s lot usually like to pull out all the stops when it comes to marketing campaigns for a new product, makes this development all the more astonishing.</p>
<p>Still, Apple CEO Tim Cook did say at the time of launch that a smaller tablet would go on sale &lsquo;sometime in November&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;s kept his word. Who knows, perhaps Apple kept quiet as it didn&rsquo;t want people pitching tents outside its stores?</p>
<p>According to Apple's online store, the second-gen iPad Mini&rsquo;s are available in 16GB and 32GB variants and come with LTE support and improved Wi-Fi capabilities. An A7 chip, the very same that debuted in the iPhone 5 nestles under the hood also, all for the bargain price of &pound;319.</p>
