<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Well, this is a creepy feature. Thanks, Instagram.</span></p>
<p>Clicking on the Instagram app and scrolling through the many perfectly filtered images is a positively solo affair. Sure, you&rsquo;re looking at other people&rsquo;s pictures and checking out the last meal that they ate, but the interaction <em>can </em>and perhaps should stop there&hellip; if you want it to.</p>
<p>Creepily enough, though, the social media platform has just brought in a new feature that is making using Instagram somewhat less private. Yes, like many other social sites and apps (&agrave; la Facebook and Whatsapp), Instagram is now going to show people if you&rsquo;re on the app, and when you were last using it.</p>
<p><em>What?!</em></p>
<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re ignoring a message from your ex, or pretending to be busy so you don&rsquo;t have to go out, Instagram is going to rat you out. Your followers will suddenly be able to see when you were last online. That means that the white lie you told about never checking the app anymore is going to come crashing down around you. Oops.</p>
<h2>How to Turn the &lsquo;Last Active&rsquo; Feature Off</h2>
<p>If the idea of your followers finding out <em>just </em>how often you&rsquo;re mindlessly scrolling through the app makes your stomach turn, don&rsquo;t panic. There&rsquo;s a staggeringly easy way to make sure that they can&rsquo;t see your activity status. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>Go to your profile page and then head to the Options menu. On Android, this is the three dots located in the top right corner. On iPhone or iPad, it&rsquo;s the little cog icon that you can see next to the Edit Profile button.</p>
<p>Scroll down through your settings until you see an option that reads Show Activity Status. Turning the feature off is merely a case of using the little toggle next to that option. It&rsquo;s as easy as that.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Once you turn off Show Activity Status, you won&rsquo;t be able to see anyone else&rsquo;s activity status either. That may be annoying for you, but think about it, why should you be able to see other people&rsquo;s when they can&rsquo;t see yours? Fair is fair, right?</p>
