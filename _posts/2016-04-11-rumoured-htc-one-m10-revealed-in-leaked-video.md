<p>A video purporting to reveal the rumoured HTC One M10 has leaked online, just one day before HTC is expected to officially spill the beans.</p>
<p>The promotional video flaunts the yet-to-be-confirmed HTC One M10 from every angle imaginable, leaving very little to the imagination.</p>
<p>The rear looks to have borrowed&nbsp;inspiration from previous iterations, like the sumptuous HTC One M9.</p>
<p>It appears as though the HTC One M10 will again sport a pair of antenna strips, flanking a slightly protruding camera lens, flash module and eye-catching HTC logo. And the video also reveals that the microUSB charging port has been swapped for USB Type-C.</p>
<p>The front of device, alleged to be HTC One M10, is more reminiscent of HTC One A9, with no grill speakers and an oval shaped home button that will likely support fingerprint reading.</p>

<p>The high production value and slick editing suggest it may well be an authentic leak; but there&rsquo;s every chance this video could be nothing more than the creation of some hard-core HTC fan, pieced together using internet titbits and other supposed seepages.</p>
<p>By now, you&rsquo;ve probably already come across said titbits and seepages. To recap, HTC One M10 is rumoured to house a rapid Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB ROM.</p>
<p><strong>HTC&rsquo;s official unveiling will be taking place tomorrow at 13:00 GMT. Make sure you&rsquo;re following @buymobiles on Twitter for live updates as the event kicks off.</strong></p>
