<p><span class="postStandFirst">Security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski has made public his allegations that there is a security flaw in Apple&rsquo;s iOS platform, one that could potentially expose users&rsquo; personal data to be mined by third parties. This is, of course, something that has been strenuously denied by Apple, who confesses nothing but faith in its iPhone security.</span></p>

<p>As the general population has grown more tech-savvy, and as people become increasingly aware of how to protect themselves from online attacks and the potential danger of personal information falling into the wrong hands, the issue of smartphone security has become a definite hot topic for discussion.</p>
<p>According to Mashable, a new discussion has arisen around Apple and the security of its smartphone platform &ndash; iOS. This popular operating system is of course what handsets like the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c run on, boasting some neat features like iMessage, Siri and iCloud.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on the crux of the issue. Security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski has made some serious allegations towards Apple, claiming that there's a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; in iOS, which could potentially allow third parties to grab users&rsquo; personal data.</p>
<p>As described by Zdziarski, &ldquo;Once the device is first unlocked after reboot, most of the data-protection encrypted data can be accessed until the device is shut down. Your device is almost always at risk of spilling all data, since it&rsquo;s almost always authenticated, even while locked.</p>
<p>Since the alleged flaw concerns Apple&rsquo;s native apps, the personal &lsquo;data&rsquo; in question here relates to some of the most private information available on an iPhone. Apple has firmly denied the allegations, with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have designed iOS so that its diagnostic functions do not compromise user privacy and security, but still provides needed information to enterprise IT departments, developers and Apple for troubleshooting technical issues. A user must have unlocked their device and agreed to trust another computer before that computer is able to access this limited diagnostic data. The user must agree to share this information, and data is never transferred without their consent.</p>
<p>As we have said before, Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Consumers have become more tech-savvy and security-conscious (a very, <em>very</em> good thing indeed) in recent years, which, coupled with Apple's traditionally high regard for security, means that iPhone users shouldn't worry too much just yet. We&rsquo;ll be following this story as it develops, so stay tuned for more news.&nbsp;</strong></p>
