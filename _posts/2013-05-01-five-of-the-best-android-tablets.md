<p><span class="postStandFirst">We take a look at some of the best Android tablet PCs around.</span></p>
<p>Tablet PCs have been increasingly popular ever since Apple created the iPad, however up until the development of Android 3.0, also known as Honeycomb, Android tablets were below-par devices that offered very little innovation or functionality.</p>
<p>Although Honeycomb wasn&rsquo;t perfect it did pave the way for the creation of Android tablets, such as the original Motorola Xoom, which could compete with the mighty iPad.</p>
<p>Now we have multi-core processors, HD displays, expandable memory facilities and Android 4.0, all of which allow for an unsurpassed user-experience.</p>
<p>Tablets now range from 7 inch slates up to 10+ inch tablets and we look at five of the best on the market.</p>
<h2>Amazon Kindle Fire</h2>
<p>The Kindle Fire HD was evolved from the immensely popular Kindle e-reader. The Kindle Fire HD has access to thousands of apps, movies, games and of course e-books, all of which look stunning on the beautiful 7 inch HD display.</p>
<h2>BlackBerry Playbook</h2>
<p>Although not strictly an Android device, the BlackBerry PlayBook is compatable with the Android market place. The device is an ultra-portable tablet, running on its own BB operating system, and is the perfect business companion as it is compatible with BB services meaning easy access to your emails and contacts, and even perfect for video calls. The PlayBook comes with a hefty 64GB of storage meaning plenty of space for music, movies, books and photos.</p>
<h2>Google Nexus 7</h2>
<p>The first tablet from Google is a real game changer. It brings together a quad-core processor, HD screen, Near Field Communication (NFC) and an ultra-slick operating platform in the guise of Android Jelly Bean 4.1. Coupled with beautiful looks and great portability the Nexus 7 really did cement Android as a true tablet platform.</p>
<h2>Motorola Xoom 2 Media Edition</h2>
<p>The Xoom 2 from Motorola is a fantastic 8 inch tablet, bringing design, portability and functionality to the table. The Xoom 2 packs a dual- core processor, 1GB of RAM and a 5 Megapixel camera making it both practical and advanced.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Tab 2</h2>
<p>The Galaxy range has gone from strength-to-strength and Samsung has grown its tablet range in accordance with this. Sporting a 10.1 inch vivid display, a dual-core processor and 16GB on-board storage, the Galaxy Tab 2 is great for surfing the web, viewing pictures or watching HD movies on.</p>
