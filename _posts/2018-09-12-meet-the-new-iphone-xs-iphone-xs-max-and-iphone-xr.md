<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Not one, not two, but THREE new iPhone models.</span></p>
<p>The wait has been a long one but it&rsquo;s finally here. Yes, the 2018 Apple Keynote speech took place today over in California and, spoiler, it was jam-packed with some of the most exciting announcements the company has made to date.</p>
<p>Hold onto your socks. Here are some of the highlights from over at the Steve Jobs Theater.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch Series 4</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EiI5_-7liQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The rumours were true. The Apple Watch has been redesigned and revamped.</p>
<p>The Series 4 version of this smartwear has a 30% larger screen (an edge-to-edge design!) and curved edges. That means that it comes in at 40mm and 44mm.</p>
<p>The standard device is available in Silver, Gold, and Space Grey while the Stainless collection will have Space Black and Gold options. Plus, bands from old Apple Watches will fit the Series 4.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about looks, either. The device is bringing the first ECG (with FDA clearance) over the counter to customers. That means that you can accurately measure your heart-rate and the device will let you know if your heartbeat drops or if it&rsquo;s irregular.</p>
<p>Plus, the Bluetooth system has been updated, the stereo is 50% louder, and the watch has been created with fitness clearly in mind.</p>
<h2>iPhone Xs and Xs Max</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iol8n3m88SA" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Apple is dubbing this latest device the most 'beautiful iPhone we've ever made'. That&rsquo;s a whole lot of hype &ndash; let&rsquo;s hope that it lives up to it. Made of surgical grade stainless steel with a gold finish, it&rsquo;s certainly a sight to behold. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the main features.</p>
<h5>Beautiful Design</h5>
<p>iPhone Xs has a 5.8-inch Super Retina Display, while the larger Xs Max boasts a 6.5-inch one. Both flaunt that edge-to-edge screen we now all love. It claims to feature the &lsquo;most durable glass in a smartphone ever&rsquo; and comes in Gold, Silver, and Space Grey. So far, so good.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18608" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GseE4rcJBtbAs5EbqPjlbGDcJxUF_KVF1tLNhYHTp2f6t1p7pS11gmLYKua6EmNYpjTDEPoXkQzpZxRtbLWjcp8y=s0" alt="" width="600" height="461" /></p>
<h5>Power and Performance</h5>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the brand new A12 Bionic chip which makes the devices 50% more energy efficient. There&rsquo;s now a massive 512GB storage option (alongside 64GB and 256GB). iPhone Xs is also more water resistant than before; so much so they&rsquo;ve been tested with a variety of liquids (including beer!) and have survived.</p>
<h5>Faster Face ID</h5>
<p>When it comes to security, there have been some changes too. Face ID has seen some upgrades making it faster than before. In theory, you should be able to merely glance down at your phone to unlock it and see notifications. It&rsquo;s all very James Bond.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18609" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xP0TftsszmUox8QwfNSvgY0sf4l3qtZG1V2yMQDTfwsRIwmWqMXYyadGp2WqiH-5FYkyE2QktVL2JRiD-tqmPFg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h5>New AR Gaming</h5>
<p>The new iPhone Xs models take AR gaming to the next level. Of course, these updates have been a long time in the making, but it looks as though the latest incarnation of the iPhone nails it.</p>
<p>There are multiplayer options which means that you can play AR games in 3D against your friends&hellip; Well, so long as they all have iPhones, that is.</p>
<h5>Camera Updates</h5>
<p>But, let&rsquo;s take a moment to chat about the camera. It should come as no surprise that it looks rather incredible. On the back, the devices boast a 12MP wide camera with a larger sensor and optical image stabilisation, as well as a 12MP telephoto camera. The selfie camera on the front also benefits from True Depth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18610" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rmQxQAXryF3FxqWknbwrMCC1ebR2wzbx7-silfBk-BoNh7ulcGwh0pPhqiUIJ9fIdxNgMm6cE87LQgiJmfXk32RJ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more that you need to know. The iPhone Xs and Xs Max can now fuse images together using a new feature called &lsquo;Smart HDR.&rsquo; They also supposedly take fantastic low-light photos and use something called &lsquo;facial landmarking&rsquo; to determine where a person&rsquo;s eyes are. It all sounds pretty rad.</p>
<h5>Dual-SIM Capability</h5>
<p>If you have more than one phone number &ndash; say a work phone and a personal one &ndash; you might think that you need two devices. Nope. iPhone Xs and Xs Max will have a dual-SIM capability. That means that you can run two SIMS in iPhone Xs at the same time. Apple says that this will need support from carriers but it is working with different companies around the globe to make it all possible.</p>
<h5>Price and Release Dates</h5>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the details, let&rsquo;s talk about when you can get the new iPhone models, and how much they&rsquo;ll cost.</p>
<p>iPhone Xs starts at &pound;999, with iPhone Xs Max is a little more expensive at &pound;1099. Both devices will be rolled out as of 21st September. Pop that date in your calendars. Not long to wait now!</p>
<h2>iPhone XR</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m_K2Yg7wGQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>While the Xs and Xs Max are this year&rsquo;s major flagship devices, there&rsquo;s a lower spec option out there too.</p>
<p>iPhone XR should come as no surprise; in the lead-up to the announcement rumours about a &lsquo;budget&rsquo; device were rife. The phone boasts aerospace-grade aluminium and comes in White, Black, Blue, Coral, Yellow, and Red.</p>
<p>The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina Display has the &lsquo;most advanced LCD ever in a smartphone.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s also the edge-to-edge screen, which looks as fantastic as it sounds. While the device doesn&rsquo;t have 3D Touch (sigh!), the developers have loaded it with the slightly different Haptic Touch.</p>
<p>The camera offering is not as impressive as the device has a single lens system on the back with a 12MP wide angle lens and optical image stabilisation. However, thanks to brand new developments, you can still take Portrait Mode photos using just one lens.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of the iPhone XR, you&rsquo;ll have to wait a little longer to get your hands on it. Apple is rolling out the phone on 26th October. However, if you do choose to hold on until then, you could save yourself some pennies. The device certainly is a more affordable option and starts at &pound;759.</p>
