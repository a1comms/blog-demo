<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Take back your private information!</span></p>
<p>When browsing the deep, dark corners of the internet, you inevitably sign up to various sites, and surrender a lot of personal details. Sometimes, it seems like every site you visit wants to know at least something about you, before you can actually use it. Doesn&rsquo;t that feel a little&hellip; worrying?</p>
<p>Have you ever considered just how much of your data is floating around the web? From your date of birth to your bank details, you&rsquo;ve likely entered a colossal amount of personal information into online forms and the like.</p>
<p>With cyber scams becoming rifer and hackers even more sinister, it&rsquo;s no wonder that so many people out there would like nothing more than to delete <em>everything</em> about themselves from the internet.</p>

<p>You might think that doing so takes hours of hard work, sifting through your many accounts and disabling them. Of course, that&rsquo;s one, slightly long-winded option available to you. Instead, developers in Sweden have created a site where you can delete most of your online presence at the click of a button.</p>
<p>www.deseat.me is a website that claims it can help you "clean up your internet presence". Note that it says, &lsquo;clean up&rsquo; rather than completely remove. The truth of the matter is that the company still has some kinks to work out.</p>
<p>Right now, you can only delete accounts that are linked to a Gmail address (not Hotmail or any other email). So, if your MySpace or Bebo were linked to an old, non-Google address, you&rsquo;re going to have to login to those accounts and get rid of them manually! Sorry.</p>
<h2>Let's&nbsp;Delete Your Old Account</h2>
<p>This clean-up service is more straightforward than you might imagine.</p>
<p>1) The first step, of course, is to go to Deseat.me. There, the site asks you to sign in with your Google account.</p>
<p>2) Next, you'll be asked to choose the accounts you want to delete (without having to provide passwords etc.), from a list of sites you're registered with.</p>
<p>3) Click the delete button next to each account you want to pull out of, and you'll get redirected to their corresponding deletion pages. Easy, right?</p>

<p>On a side note, the guys running Deseat.me have yet to find the account removal pages for every single online account. But the most common are of course already in the firing line, such as Facebook, Yelp and the like.</p>
<p>If, over the years, you&rsquo;ve signed up to a million online gambling, dating, and job search sites, you may need to find another way to eradicate your internet presence.</p>
