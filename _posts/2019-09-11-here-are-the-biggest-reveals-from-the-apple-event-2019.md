<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic if you missed the action. We&rsquo;ve got you covered! Let&rsquo;s take a look at the biggest event highlights. Read on or watch the event highlights below.</p>

<h2>iPhone 11: The Next Generation of Smartphone</h2>
<p>First up, the one that we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for - the next generation of iPhone. It&rsquo;s finally here. Sporting the &lsquo;toughest ever&rsquo; glass for an iPhone on the front and back, the brand-new iPhone 11 comes in Purple, White, Yellow, Green, Black, and PRODUCT(RED).</p>
<p>On the rear, it packs a dual camera setup including a 12-megapixel wide lens and 12-megapixel ultra-wides lens. There&rsquo;s also a new semantic rending feature as well as some updates to Night Mode and the much-loved Portrait Mode. On such update&mdash;that certainly won&rsquo;t go unnoticed&mdash;is the ability to take amazing portraits of pets as well as people. Oh, and the camera interface has been redesigned too, making it more user-friendly than ever!</p>
<p>Under the hood, there&rsquo;s the A13 bionic chipset that also happens to include the fastest graphic processing unit on an iPhone yet. That&rsquo;s excellent news for anybody who is interested in mobile gaming as it means a better, smoother look. When it comes to the battery, iPhone 11 will offer an hour more power than the previous iPhone XR model.</p>

<h2>iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Seriously Advanced Smartphones</h2>
<p>Next up, there&rsquo;s a new addition to the iPhone line-up and it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve never seen before now. Take a deep breath and then say hello to iPhone 11 Pro. Made from a surgical-grade steel, glass on the rear and a cool matt texture finish, it&rsquo;s a thing of true beauty. It comes in Space Grey, Silver, Gold and Midnight Green.</p>
<p>The new Pro phone also comes in two sizes, with the standard measuring in at 5.8 inches and the Max version larger at 6.5 inches. Both devices showcase the brand-new Super Retina XDR Display. Sounds rather snazzy.</p>
<p>It runs the same A13 bionic chipset that the standard iPhone 11 will have. Kicking things up a gear, the battery life is supposed to last four hours longer than that of iPhone XS. Bonus: There&rsquo;s an 18-watt fast-charge adapter included in the box too, which means that you can juice up super quickly when you are running low.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s the camera setup that truly marks this iPhone model as the leader of the pack. On the rear, there&rsquo;s a triple camera setup which includes a 12-megapixel wide angle, a 12-megapixel telephoto and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens. It doesn&rsquo;t end there. There&rsquo;s also better 4K video filming, an updated Optical zoom, and brand new in-app editing features.</p>

<h2>iPadOS: More Powerful Than Ever Before</h2>
<p>The event also saw the launch of the next generation of iPad and some exciting news about the interface.</p>
<p>Of course, before now, iPad has run the same operating system as its iPhone counterparts. However, one of the biggest announcements of the day could be a game-changer. The tablet will now have its own system called iPadOS. Watch this space!</p>
<h2>Apple Arcade: A Subscription Gaming Platform</h2>
<p>Mobile gaming is a massive industry. Usually, premium smartphone apps work on a pay-per-game basis. Apple is set to change that with Apple Arcade.</p>
<p>The service, which will be available via the App Store, will be a subscription service. With that in mind, users will pay a monthly fee and have access to a whole range of Apple-friendly arcade games. Think of it as the Netflix of mobile gaming. It will launch 19th September.</p>
<h2>Apple TV Plus: A New Type of Streaming Service</h2>
<p>Talking of Netflix&hellip; Yes, you might have seen this one coming. Apple is set to take on the entertainment streaming service.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf out of their competitor&rsquo;s book, Apple TV Plus is set to launch with a wide range of original content including series such as The Morning Show, See and much more. The service launches 1st November 2019.</p>
