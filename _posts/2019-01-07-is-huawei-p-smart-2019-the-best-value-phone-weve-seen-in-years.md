<p>The device is a budget phone with its price tag of &pound;199.00 SIM free, but offers a serious wealth of high-end features.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about one of Huawei&rsquo;s latest smartphones.</p>

<p>Should you glance at the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p-smart-2019-blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei P smart 2019</a>, you could easily confuse it for one of the latest flagship phones. Sure, this device may have a budget-friendly price tag, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the phone lacks anything in terms of design.</p>
<p>The wonderfully 3D curved unibody comes complete with a ceramic-like coating. There&rsquo;s also a neat 6.21-inch FullView display, which has more than enough quality for the average user.</p>
<h2>Easy on The Eye!</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not merely the design that looks ace here. The powers at Huawei have gone to great lengths to make sure that the screen is good for your eyes.</p>
<p>The Comfort Mode filters allow you to get rid of all the blue light, so you can read whatever&rsquo;s on your screen without any strain.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a bedtime phone user, you will most definitely find this feature useful.</p>

<p>Packing dual 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel cameras, the photography setup on the Huawei P smart 2019 won&rsquo;t leave you wanting.</p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get your heart racing, the feature also uses an artificial intelligence function too. It can identify 22 categories and 500 scenarios when taking a picture, according to Huawei.</p>
<p>Plus, you&rsquo;ve got a pretty remarkable f/1.8 aperture along with a natural bokeh effect too. So, snap away.</p>
