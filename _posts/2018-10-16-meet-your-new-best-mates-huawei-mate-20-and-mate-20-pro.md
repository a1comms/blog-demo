<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the latest Huawei phone announcement!</span></p>
<p>Huawei, the Chinese mega-brand, just announced two brand new devices &ndash; the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/mate-20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei Mate 20</a> and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. The launch took place at the ExCel Centre in London. If you didn&rsquo;t manage to catch it for yourself, here&rsquo;s what you missed.</p>
<h2>Perfected Flowing Design</h2>
<p>The Huawei Mate 20 and Huawei Mate 20 Pro both pack impressive, bright displays, and a design that looks both sleek and modern. There are a couple of colour options, too on the Pro. It&rsquo;s available in either black or twilight, while the Mate 20 is yours in black.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19199" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_er3TUlTUwP4avoiWsv8XkJ46PrT_qydHCzd5mgWeABXJDzXYDlhOwkxvxjgStaP7vTVtreUprX2uAF-RoG3hCSd=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Huawei claims that this new screen brightness will not affect power consumption. Quite the opposite. As part of the launch, they explained that the devices will be energy efficient and low on general consumption. Nice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a notch on the top of each device, but it&rsquo;s smaller on the Mate 20. The curved design of the phone means that it fits perfectly in your hand. The device is also made from material boasting a micro 3D hyper optical pattern. That should mean that the glass is less slippy when you hold it (which hopefully means you&rsquo;re less likely to drop it).</p>
<h2>Top-of-the-Range Features</h2>
<h5>In-Screen Fingerprint Sensor</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19203" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ltcz4FI1IlB0WlvAe2z7EK0IH4xlwH9nyXXeh572862o3_GxgPx64JWOEYoACz_vT4j8Qc7S3LvFJn1KtwhqSGIk=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>We all know that mobile security is key in the modern world. When it comes to security features, there&rsquo;s a fingerprint sensor inside the phone screen. That means that you simply have to tap a finger onto the screen, where indicated, and the device will unlock.</p>
<h5>Dual Speakers</h5>
<p>The devices also boast dual speakers. But, when you first look at them, you can&rsquo;t see a speaker on the exterior of the phone at all. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that. The speakers are actually packed inside the USB-C port inside the phone.</p>
<h5>Super-Fast Charging</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19201" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZaG3mUUkFOp0rLWxrGGs6R9zpujoeh3tVOnZ3lAUnjeFfGIEgyDq7UUm9l_vpZ727is7kMJ3uSaNXvXLpJVwKpzQ5A=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Waiting around for your phone to juice up is zero fun. Luckily, the new Huawei Mate 20 Pro has a super-fast charging system. That means that you can charge 70% of the battery in as little as 30 minutes. It&rsquo;s pretty impressive stuff. Similarly, the Mate 20 will recharge 58% in the same time.</p>
<h5>World&rsquo;s First Wireless Reverse Charge</h5>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic of charging your phone up, there&rsquo;s another handy little feature you need to know about. Huawei Mate 20 Pro has the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;wireless reverse charge&rsquo; system. That means that you can use it to charge other compatible phones and devices. A-ma-zing.</p>
<h5>Remarkable Cameras</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19202" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XzJppgA6eG_rUXhmHRS4xz-arARbktFacjqNbVDEqGBzrbd-V9L7hd1cnUxkwnHR4b_Ms54ZOAFURKqkiJHblSg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, we all know that Huawei has invested heavily in its camera systems. The two latest devices are evidence of that fact as both have triple offerings. The Huawei Mate 20 has a 16MP lens, 12MP lens, and 8MP telephoto lens on the rear.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Pro version of the phone has a 40MP lens, 20MP lens, and the same 8MP telephoto lens on the rear. There&rsquo;s also special low-light features when it comes to photography in darker or dimmer places.</p>
<h5>Natural User Experience</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19200" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iq2ai-08gViWxGCqbpB8XNzYgIbRrpDKYQKBsyTAaZH7nONsXIhLKKh_jUT6gH-f8JM-ldNRTqKX-i3d2aS0D9ml=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Supported by Android 9, the EMUI9 operating system is &lsquo;inspired by nature&rsquo; and promises to bring you a completely immersive experience. As a part of that, there will be a whole load of natural-looking styles from which to choose as well as gesture navigation.</p>
<h2>Free Smartwatch and Wireless Charger</h2>
<p>Both Huawei Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro are already available to pre-order. Can&rsquo;t decide which one to go for? This should help.</p>
<p>If you pre-order Huawei Mate 20 Pro&nbsp;at Buymobiles.net before October 26th, you can claim a free Huawei Watch GT and wireless charger, together worth &pound;259. You can&rsquo;t ask for much better than that.</p>
