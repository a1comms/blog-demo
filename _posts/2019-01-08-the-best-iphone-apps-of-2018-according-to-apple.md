<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It's not too late to get last year's best iPhone apps this year!</span></p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re well and truly into 2019 (oh, hello New Year!), it&rsquo;s time to reflect and look back on all that last year brought us.</p>
<p>It was a fantastic 12 months for apps from self-care tools to fun games. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the best iPhone apps of 2018, according to Apple.</p>
<h2>The App of the Year 2018</h2>
<p>Apple has named the official app of 2018, and the winner is&hellip; &nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate-pocket/id916366645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Procreate Pocket</a>!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19840" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VOB0hivDqmo1eP0jMhya-OwvE8eUdL1ojcIg8UOM-S-LMwKUdBBoIveuYzrRMqT7m1FBHUiDlUobd0zWiHBqa8k=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The creative little app allows users to sketch, illustrate and draw whatever happens to pop into their mind at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Packed with an artist&rsquo;s toolbox and a whopping 136 different brushes from which to choose, this has to be one of the most advanced art apps out there. It&rsquo;s no wonder it proved to be one of the best iPhone apps of 2018.</p>
<h2>The Game of the Year 2018</h2>

<p>If you prefer to use your iPhone for gaming rather than sketching, then you might be more interested in what the game of the year was in 2018.</p>
<p>The good people at Apple picked a remarkably addictive game for this title&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/donut-county/id1292099839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donut County</a> is a puzzle game like no other. Rather than simply getting you to solve riddles, this app actually follows a storyline too.</p>
<h2>The Best iPhone Apps of 2018 for Self-care</h2>
<p>Self-care was one of the biggest trends last year and with good reason.</p>
<p>Since we all lead extremely busy and stressful lives, taking some time out to relax and unwind isn&rsquo;t a luxury. It&rsquo;s an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Recognising this fact, Apple has dubbed the app trend of the year as, you guessed it, self-care. Here are some of the best iPhone apps of 2018 that helped us all get a small slice of mindfulness.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fabulous-daily-motivation/id1203637303?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabulous - Daily Motivation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19841" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/63zF4HNvWmvA7trhd4guyagaAXhKdu3UsvrN0l7hkO5YOXwTlQZ7TJkyZbvT_BzysTFkcBhPaOfu-DQDiNGwjgB8Fw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an app that will help you revamp your day-to-day life, Fabulous might be it.</p>
<p>The app is designed to help you build positive daily habits like eating well, getting up early, and focussing on your goals.</p>
<p>You start out by answering questions about your current lifestyle and habits. The app then designs a plan that will help you live a better life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Fabulous is one of the best apps of 2018 if you&rsquo;re in need of a few lifestyle upgrades. But here comes the fine print. The subscription-based iPhone app costs &pound;43.99 per year, which means that it&rsquo;s a hefty investment. You can get a week&rsquo;s free trial to see whether it&rsquo;s for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm/id571800810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19842" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LMGGSU2SxyWLAWrpwPUQew4r-TIP1XBrmdulc0_LP-v6aTGENWtkDSoGFM3-pmuka2P7BDNeXR1TuORijVh3NG6K=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Ready to try meditation? Calm is one of the best iPhone apps of 2018 for you.</p>
<p>The app is recommended by top health experts and boasts a collection of meditation tracks and sessions.</p>
<p>You can choose from three, five, 10, 15, 20 or 25-minute meditations, depending on what suits you.</p>
<p>The app costs around &pound;10 per month but you can get it cheaper if you pay for a year up-front.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shine-self-care-meditation/id1293721589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shine</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19839" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/76DeH9MILOSvuqNeMyfUiSCJDHi80JJbIABEBwyJBzLDGnziFW6Wkt6X3iwN5PPJMlzo44PemLfO-yMUrVidnrA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Imagine you had a friend who sent you inspiring and motivational texts each and every day. That&rsquo;s basically what the Shine app offers.</p>
<p>The so-called &lsquo;pep talk in your pocket&rsquo; app delivers you regular messages with research-backed facts and affirmations to keep you calm, relaxed, and motivated throughout your day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a helpful &lsquo;check in&rsquo; feature which will remind you to be grateful for all you have along with meditation sessions.</p>
<p>If all the above sounds like something you&rsquo;d benefit from, you might want to get the app sooner rather than later. This is another subscription-based offer and the service costs around &pound;40 per year. Again, there&rsquo;s a free trial you can give a whirl.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/10-happier-meditation/id992210239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% Happier</a></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3b80rEg4Phk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Want to sleep better, reduce stress, and boost your focus? 10% Happier is the app that claims it can help you do all the above.</p>
<p>The self-care tool has a selection of videos, meditation sessions, and advice to help you boost your happiness levels (by around 10%... probably!).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new content uploaded regularly, which means that you should never get bored of doing the same old routines.</p>
<p>Note: The app is a premium one and the subscription costs about &pound;8 per month.</p>
