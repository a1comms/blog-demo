<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Spring is here, which for Samsung fans can only mean one thing: a new Galaxy smartphone.</span></p>
<p>The last few years, round about March or April, Samsung has announced an update to its flagship Samsung Galaxy S series. And as chance would have it, Samsung just released a teaser for an upcoming Unpacked event.</p>

<p>Historically, Samsung&rsquo;s Unpacked events have been the platform to launch a new top-range Galaxy smartphone, like <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> and S7 edge of 2016, and the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge of the year prior to that.</p>
<p>Naturally, you might assume that Samsung&rsquo;s upcoming Unpacked event, scheduled for 29/03/17, will be headlined by the very latest Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.</p>
<p>Sadly, with no official word from our South Korean friends, we can neither confirm nor deny any assumptions. All we can do is wait, full of hope, and keep our diary clear for the end of March.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you&rsquo;d like to register your interest in &lsquo;The New Samsung Galaxy&rsquo; smartphone, then head over to our <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New and Upcoming Phones</a> page. You&rsquo;ll be the first to hear any announcements, including official dates, prices and other details.</p>
