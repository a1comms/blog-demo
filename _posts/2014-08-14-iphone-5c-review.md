<p><span class="postStandFirst">Announced as a companion-piece to the premium iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c offers the iconic iPhone experience, in a range of new and exciting colours, and at a more affordable price.</span></p>
<p>Apple has set a welcomed precedent by announcing not one, but&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;new iPhones. There is, of course, the premium-bodied&nbsp;iPhone 5s, as well as another, arguably more intriguing device - the iPhone that broke the mould.</p>
<p>As you are undoubtedly aware, we are talking about the &lsquo;unapologetically plastic&rsquo; iPhone 5c. In many ways it&rsquo;s an unprecedented departure from previous handsets in the range, which adds to the sense of curiosity around it.</p>
<p>So, how does this wonderfully colourful iPhone fair against expectation?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out&hellip;</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one way in which iPhone 5c really veered off on a tangent compared to previous iPhones, it&rsquo;s in terms of its design, or rather, in terms of the&nbsp;<em>colours</em>&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>Where previous iPhones were available in black (and eventually white, although in days gone by, the white version always seemed to be delayed), iPhone 5c is available in a range of&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;striking colours. The blue model is a particular stand out for us.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7029 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14915128732_9920044d66_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5c design" width="640" height="525" /></p>
<p>While some may wonder how the plastic body measures up against phones with metal bodies, we reckon that it&rsquo;s right up there with the best. The quality is exceptional &ndash; although let&rsquo;s be honest, we expect that from Apple &ndash; and the range of colours make it far easier to match your phone to your personality.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Ever since Apple started installing &ldquo;Retina Displays&rdquo; in their iPhones, the resulting products have boasted some of the most immersive screens on the market. While iPhone 5c might not have the insanely high resolution of, say, LG G3, it has a smaller screen (which can be easier to use with just one hand), so it doesn&rsquo;t need that massive pixel resolution.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7030 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14915128542_37ebd86166_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 5c display" width="800" height="348" /></p>
<p>As well as that, the screen is beautifully vibrant, incredibly responsive (a rather important thing in a touchscreen phone), and feels silky to the touch. So, while there are bigger screens with a higher resolution out there, for the size of iPhone 5c, the quality is unquestionable.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to compare iPhone processors to those found in other Android and Windows Phone devices, simply because they don&rsquo;t use the same ones.</p>
<p>Apple famously opts for its own custom designed chipsets, and in this case, the Apple A6 uses a 1.3GHz dual-core CPU. This, compared to the quad-core 1.6GHz processor on Samsung Galaxy S4, may not sound very powerful. But, we assure you, it is.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7031 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14728887418_a03f9694d2_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5c performance" width="640" height="302" /></p>
<p>You have to take into account that while the processor on iPhone 5c is a dual-core model, the operating system is optimised for the hardware, since both were specifically built to suit each other. Whereas Android handsets comprise of components that aren&rsquo;t necessarily as tailored to suit specific devices.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, the performance of iPhone 5c is fantastic. It&rsquo;s fast, sleek and responsive, and it really does guarantee an enjoyable user experience.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>iPhone 5c comes with an 8MP iSight camera, and while there are higher resolution cameras out there, this one boasts an impressively large sensor (which is actually&nbsp;<em>physically</em>&nbsp;larger than a lot of other phones, allowing lots of light in), as well as a HDR (High Dynamic Range) to produce some truly gorgeous photos.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7032 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14892501136_42c1d4759e_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 5c camera" width="800" height="383" /></p>
<p>This is a definitely a case where raw numbers don&rsquo;t even come close to telling the whole story!</p>
<h2>Extra Features</h2>
<p>One of the best things about any iPhone is the range of native apps that come installed on them. There&rsquo;s Siri of course, and that&rsquo;s a pretty good extra in itself, but the big one that really catches our attention is Apple&rsquo;s AirDrop service.</p>
<p>With this, you can easily share files from your phone to other AirDrop-enabled devices in your house (Apple TV, for example), with a couple of simple actions, and without having to link the two devices together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a massively useful feature, both for sharing files, and for playing music round the house.</p>
<p>In addition, iPhones come with other great apps like iMessage (for free texting, as long as you&rsquo;re using WiFi or within your data allowance), iCloud (for free online storage), FaceTime (for video calls in HD with friends and family) Maps, iBooks and a whole load of others.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Before the launch of iPhone 5c, everyone dubbed it as &ldquo;the budget iPhone&rdquo;. Whilst it&rsquo;s not strictly a budget phone, in the sense that&nbsp;Motorola Moto G 4G&nbsp;is, it is cheaper than its counterpart &ndash; iPhone 5s.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone 5c really does offer an awesome range of features (AirDrop being a big stand-out) and a selection of funky colours, which you simply can&rsquo;t get elsewhere. It&rsquo;s a huge triumph for Apple.&nbsp;</strong></p>
