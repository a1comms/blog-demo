<p><span class="postStandFirst">4G internet access is really fast, right? Well prepare yourselves, because the next evolution in mobile data might be about to make its big debut. It&rsquo;s called Cat 10 4G, and if the rumours are true, <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/ee">EE</a> might be about to <em>triple</em> its network&rsquo;s top speed...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6051" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/cKYnP1ZDizeo6ShHF6u5Tx82jRtuo7zjn1B_vxIZU30RmLoRxEaAzzVhuauJZP1PuAw300.png" alt="EE" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>4G data access is still being rolled out across the country by various networks, but we&rsquo;re now hearing rumours about what the next big thing in the world of mobile internet might be; if those rumours come to fruition, it&rsquo;s going to be very exciting.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2014/12/ee-trialling-ultra-fast-cat-10-4g-network.html">ShinyShiny</a>, EE is planning on trialling the <em>next</em> evolution in 4G internet access, called Cat 10, and at the same time as <em>that</em>, the new data standard is rumoured to be heading to the Samsung Galaxy S6, the next flagship from the world&rsquo;s biggest smartphone manufacturer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4694 size-medium" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_charcoal-BLACK_01-300x300.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" width="300" height="300" /><span class="caption">*The Samsung Galaxy S5 has been a top-selling handset of 2014.</span></p>
<p>And why is this exciting? Well quite simply, it comes down to speed, with Cat 10 4G able to hit download speeds of a colossal <em>450Mbps</em>!</p>
<p>On the network&rsquo;s end, the issue with getting this data connection up and running is the infrastructure, or rather, the spectrum needed to deliver it. EE is in a prime position to take advantage of this technological leap, as their spectrum acquisitions in the 4G auctions will apparently allow them to roll out the new connection standard.</p>
<p>On the phone&rsquo;s end, it comes down to the hardware, specifically the modem inside the phone; in the Galaxy S6, if the rumour is true, it&rsquo;s the new modem that will allow it to use Cat 10 4G services (by comparison, current flagship smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the LG G3 use Cat 6 4G data, and even with LTE-Advanced, which is being trialled in London, the top speed is around 150Mbps).</p>
<p><strong>While this rumour remains unconfirmed, for now, this could prove to be something very exciting indeed. Stay tuned for more news.</strong></p>
