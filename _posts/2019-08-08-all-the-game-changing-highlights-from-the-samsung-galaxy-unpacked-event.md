<p>The second Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event of 2019 was a real doozy. Yesterday, the elite of the tech world gathered to find out what the megabrand had in store. Don&rsquo;t worry if you didn&rsquo;t manage to get a VIP pass to the event. We&rsquo;ve got all the details right here.</p>

<h2>The Main Event: Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and 10 Plus</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First up, the Unpacked event started with a quick teaser video. In the clip &ndash;&nbsp;which was shown on a huge dome-esque screen &ndash;&nbsp;we got our first glimpses of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-aura-black" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> and the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-plus-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The standard Note 10 has the thinnest bezels ever paired with an incredible 6.3-inch screen; while the Note 10 Plus takes it up another level with the largest ever Note screen at 6.8-inches.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They come packed with a snazzy-sounding immersive, dynamic AMOLED display. However, it doesn&rsquo;t end there. There&rsquo;s a small &lsquo;secret camera&rsquo; which floats at the top of the display. Taking on the punch hole design, this lens is unassuming.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the Note series of phones without the signature S-Pen. The last time we heard about this extra, it had gained the ability to be used as a remote control. During the Unpacked event, Samsung highlighted this aspect of the stylus, showing us how we could vlog without ever touching the screen of our phones. Neat.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As far as the Note 10 cameras go, we&rsquo;re certainly seeing some upgrades here too. There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;lens for every situation' along with overall enhanced photography settings. For instance, videos will now have the bokeh effects. There are also some smart effects here too which should mean that making a video is smoother than ever before.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made a video, you can use the S-Pen to edit it. Perhaps one of the coolest new things you can do with this gadget is the AR Doodle feature. This one allows you to draw a shape on the screen and make it 3D in an instant. Futuristic stuff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Y995u6HFw","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The AR features don&rsquo;t end there &ndash;&nbsp;not by a long shot. During the event, Samsung also showed us how we could use the feature to 3D scan objects and create animations using them. It&rsquo;s plain to see that AR is coming on in leaps and bounds right now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Juicing up will be simple too! With both the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus, you get super-fast charging. After just 30 minutes of charging with a special 45W charger, the brand says that you will have enough power to last you the whole day. Of course, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the standard 25W charger comes with the phone. If you want the quicker charger, you will need to pay extra.</p>

<h2>New and Improved Samsung Dex</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Samsung Dex is nothing new but the brand has made a load of improvements here. For&nbsp;example, the Note 10 devices will each have a &lsquo;Link to Windows&rsquo; button in the notification window. When you turn this mode on, you will be able to check out your texts, notifications and more on the screen of your Windows PC. The company also says that you will be able to make calls through your computer too, without having to use your phone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>The Special Edition Samsung Galaxy Active 2</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk wearables. Samsung will be releasing a special Galaxy Active 2 Under Armour Edition. The smart fitness watch comes complete with the MapMyRun app and will seamlessly connect with the Under Armour Hover Shoes too. There&rsquo;s also a rotating digital dial here, which makes the watch look like an old-school analogue when you&rsquo;re not using it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Say Hello to&hellip; the Samsung Galaxy Book S</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s finally here. Boasting 23 hours of battery life, a super slick minimal design and the Snapdragon 8cx chip, this is the Samsung Galaxy Book S. The laptop will run a Windows system and is a super lightweight (under 1KG) and small (11.8mm thickness) device. That means that it should be ideal for people who are always working on the go.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this new edition to the Samsung lineup will work perfectly with the current ecosystem. Sharing photos and media via your phone and laptop will be instantaneous while you will also get texts and notifications on your computer screen. The device also has an &lsquo;instant-on&rsquo; feature which allows it to power-up in seconds.</p>

<h2>The Microsoft-Samsung Partnership</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before the Unpacked event was over, Samsung had one more surprise for us. Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, came to the stage to make an important announcement. The gist is that Microsoft and Samsung are planning to partner up for future projects. Right now, it&rsquo;s not 100% clear what that means but we can expect exciting stuff in the near future.</p>
