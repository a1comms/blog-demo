<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s long been said that more and more people are starting to use their mobile devices, their smartphones and their tablets, as their primary way of accessing the internet, and moving away from desktop PCs.</span></p>
<p>Many people have taken this to be a sign that we are living in, as the late Steve Jobs famously called it, a &ldquo;post-PC world&rdquo;, and new statistics released by Nielsen suggest that this might actually be the case!</p>
<p>Looking at the figures from December 2013, Nielsen found that while people in Britain went online via a PC for roughly 29 hours during the month, they spent a whopping 41 hours browsing accessing the internet from mobile devices like the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the iOS-powered iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>In short, people are using their mobile devices to access the internet far more than they use their PCs, but what might be causing this? What are the top 3 things people do online via their smartphones, and why might the mobile device be the weapon of choice for each of those things?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p>
<h2>3) Entertainment</h2>
<p>In the third place spot we have &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo;, and while it&rsquo;s tempting to instantly translate that as &ldquo;Youtube&rdquo;, something else might be at play here. The UK has a much higher percentage than either the USA or Japan in this category (15% of our time with smartphones is spent on entertainment), so what else might be going on besides Youtube?</p>
<p>The answer could well be simple: BBC iPlayer, along with ITV Player, 4OD and Demand5. TV on demand is&nbsp;<em>immensely</em>&nbsp;popular in the UK, and given that a smartphone like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is so much easier to hook up to a television than a PC (especially if it&rsquo;s a desktop PC, rooted to one spot), it&rsquo;s perhaps unsurprising that us Brits do like to use our phones for iPlayer!</p>
<h2>2) Games</h2>
<p>In the number 2 spot is something that should come as no surprise to anyone, as mobile gaming is rapidly becoming one of the most popular forms of gaming on the planet. There&rsquo;s a distinct appeal to being able to pick up your games console and carry it around with you, and that&rsquo;s effectively what mobile gaming actually&nbsp;<em>is</em>.</p>
<p>With the phenomenal success of games like&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>, and games that are almost indistinguishable from their console- or PC-based cousins (for example,&nbsp;<em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</em>&nbsp;on the iPhone 5c), then it was perhaps inevitable that this activity would be one of the big three, taking up 18% of the average Brit&rsquo;s smartphone usage.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the most popular activity, because that honour goes to...</p>
<h2>1) Social Networking</h2>
<p>Coming in at the top spot, and eating up 29% of the time we spend on our smartphones, is social networking, and the appeal of this one is easy to see; with Facebook and Twitter apps, we can not only see what our friends are doing in real-time, but update the rest of the world about&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;activities, without needing to find a PC with which to log in.</p>
<p><strong>And so, there we have it; the top three things that have made us start using our smartphones more than our PCs. Whether they will one day replace PCs entirely is still up in the air, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure: they&rsquo;re going to make a valiant effort to do so!</strong></p>
