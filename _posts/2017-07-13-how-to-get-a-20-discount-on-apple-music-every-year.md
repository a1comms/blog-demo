<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Pay less for your Apple Music subscription with this handy tip.</span></p>
<p>What a time to be alive. Gone are the days when you have to buy or even download individual albums or tracks online.</p>
<p>Now, you have the <em>entire</em> world&rsquo;s catalogue of music at your fingertips. Simply open an app on your phone, search for an artist or song you like, and in mere seconds you&rsquo;ll be grooving along.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no doubt that we&rsquo;re all eternally grateful for this musical wizardry, there&rsquo;s just one teeny tiny thing that could make the experience better. What if you could pay <em>less </em>for your Apple Music subscription? I know it&rsquo;s a wild idea but&hellip; stay with me here&hellip; because you can.</p>

<p>As it stands, you&rsquo;re probably paying &pound;9.99 for a monthly subscription to the music streaming service. For context, that works out at &pound;119.98 per year. What you may not know, though, is that Apple offer an annual deal which will save you about 17.5% since it comes in at just &pound;99.</p>
<p>You may not have heard about this deal before now since Apple has been quiet on the subject. Even though the service was officially introduced a few months ago, few people seem to know about it. There was no huge media push or advertising campaign to back it up. Instead, one day, the new deal just appeared...</p>
<p>*Poof!*</p>
<h2>How to Get an Apple Music Discount</h2>
<p>So, how can you change your plan and get a discount on Apple Music? First, go to the Apple Music app, then tap <strong>For You > Account > View Apple ID > Subscriptions > Apple Music Membership</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve opened the membership menu, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to switch your subscription from a monthly to an annual contract, saving yourself &pound;20 in the process.</p>
<p>However, you can only make this change if you&rsquo;re already a monthly user. If you&rsquo;re completely new to Apple Music, you won&rsquo;t be able to get the &pound;99/year subscription right away. If you want it, t sign up as a monthly user and then swiftly switch over to the annual deal instead. It&rsquo;s a little bit of hassle but the money you&rsquo;ll save will make it worthwhile!</p>
