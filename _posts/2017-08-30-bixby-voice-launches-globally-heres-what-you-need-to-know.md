<p>Just last week, Samsung announced that Bixby Voice would be expanding its availability to a massive 200 countries and territories across the globe. At the moment, the AI is available in both U.S. English and Korean, and has a bunch of cool voice command features that you&rsquo;re going to want to try for yourself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now millions of customers worldwide have access to a new and intelligent way of interacting with their phone,&rdquo; explains Injong Rhee, Executive Vice President and Head of R&amp;D, Software and Services of the Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The expansion of Bixby&rsquo;s voice capabilities is an initial step in the continued rollout of Bixby functionality. In the future, Bixby will have the learning power to offer more intelligent and personalized interactions and seamless connections across more devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounds like a dream, right? Still, if you have a Samsung device (or are thinking of grabbing one soon), you might be wondering what the deal is with Bixby Voice. How does it work? What can you really do with it? Will it even understand you? Well, we&rsquo;re glad you asked! Here are just a few ways you can use Bixby Voice for yourself.</p>
<h4>Create &lsquo;quick commands&rsquo; for Bixby</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14773 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/whvQ9_lTA6N2lTRgF7fFCo3034ls3NdnOxmvqxQEkVM3Lw1BBtfSHDETViG3VSfyz9GkHzc99ZGk5PhQXuiDxgkvYw=s0" alt="" width="600" height="328" /></p>
<p>One of the things that Samsung is shouting about right now is Bixby&rsquo;s ability to understand &lsquo;natural language&rsquo;. That means that you don&rsquo;t need to talk like a robot to have the AI understand what you&rsquo;re saying. However, if you want to keep the chit-chat to a minimum, there&rsquo;s a way to do just that.</p>
<p>The Quick Commands function means that you don&rsquo;t need to say the full command to get Bixby to do something, you can just say a word or two instead. You can set this word or phrase by heading to the &lsquo;My Bixby&rsquo; menu. For example, you might just need to say &lsquo;Text Mark&rsquo; when you actually want the phone to text Mark that you&rsquo;re about to leave work.</p>
<h4>Take a selfie with ease</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14772 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pltW_KpF0PuNaFDSX-nCh8HuwjNPMiCWQsN5tiizJW5gxHnn2GMaSdOtZ9kC2Eu9mhheii2MyZtqwMivMsJC2e1t=s0" alt="" width="600" height="393" /></p>
<p>We all know that it can be hard taking selfies. Trying to reach your finger around to hit that button is a real pain. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be way better if you could just tell your phone to take the picture? Well, now you can.</p>
<p>Rather than having to press a button when you want to snap the perfect pose, you can just utter the words &lsquo;Take a selfie&rsquo; to Bixby. This handy trick means that you can take hands-free pictures with no trouble at all. Yes!</p>
<h4>Change the settings on your phone</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14771 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d9ykkVhv1Q6eGe4DXHH-rIhwockqnlPggC2n4E5u_XndzOTqvg5tSaHWB6h0-ki9zbE39GuIp1Vc_T-uIWO-IlU=s0" alt="" width="600" height="281" /></p>
<p>Of course, one of the main things that many people will use Bixby for is changing the settings on their phone. No longer will you have to do this manually or through a dedicated app. Instead, you can tell Bixby what you want changing and it will do it in an instant. Honestly, nothing could be easier.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to brighten up your phone screen, you can tell Bixby Voice to &lsquo;Set brightness to 70%.&rsquo; The device should react right away and become brighter. There&rsquo;s a whole host of ways in which you can you the AI to change things on your Samsung device, and so it&rsquo;s really worth playing around with it a little here. Enjoy!</p>
