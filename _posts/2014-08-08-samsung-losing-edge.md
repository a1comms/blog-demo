<p><b></b><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has noted that in Q2 of 2014, its profits took a little bit of a hit, dropping from around &pound;4.1 billion to around &pound;3.6 billion, in spite of still being the largest phone manufacturer in the world. We take a look at what factors caused this slump in profit, and at how Samsung plans on bringing its profits back up once again.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4498" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G800H_GS5-mini_Black_Duos_2.jpg" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>News has recently emerged that Korean manufacturer <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung">Samsung</a> has seen its lowest level of profit for two years, during Q2 of 2014. This is particularly big news, since Samsung is the largest phone manufacturer in the world, and it&rsquo;s a situation that most definitely demands analysis.</p>
<p>So, after the news that the company&rsquo;s profits have dropped from around &pound;4.1 billion to &pound;3.6 billion, let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of key questions, specifically: what factors have caused this slump in profits, and what can Samsung do to get profits back up to the level they were at previously?</p>
<h2><b>Stronger competition from manufacturers, Chinese or otherwise</b></h2>
<p>We won&rsquo;t dwell too much on this aspect, since it applies less in the UK than it does in China itself, but Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Lenovo are selling well in the UK, thanks to the value for money they offer with their mid-range phones.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not just Chinese manufacturers who have impacted Samsung&rsquo;s profits in the mid-range, because there&rsquo;s another mid-range phone that offers even better value for money. It is of course the Motorola Moto G, and it&rsquo;s been selling <em>really</em> well. It has undoubtably impacted Samsung&rsquo;s bottom line, as people grabbed one of those instead of, say, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (or perhaps the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini - which is available to pre-order).</p>
<h2><b>High marketing spend</b></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, while Samsung has seen less sales, its marketing spend has remained high (and its marketing spend has traditionally been <em>very</em> high indeed), with the marketing blitz around the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 being a particularly big one (due to the phone facing stiff competition form the likes of the HTC One M8 and the utterly stunning iPhone 5s).</p>
<p>Naturally, with the same high spend, but with less sales, profits inevitably took a hit...</p>
<h2><b>A strong pound</b></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one final factor that seems to have affected Samsung&rsquo;s profits, although it&rsquo;s a factor that might come slightly out of left-field, since it has precisely nothing to do with mobile phones, at all.</p>
<p>Instead, it all comes down to the value of the pound, which is currently performing very strongly in the global economic landscape. Without getting into the technicalities of it, a strong pound means that anyone exporting from South Korea to the UK will see less money coming in from those UK sales.</p>
<p>All three factors have combined to make Samsung&rsquo;s profits take a little bit of a nosedive.</p>
<h2><b>Where does Samsung go from here?</b></h2>
<p>At this point, though, there&rsquo;s a really important point we need to make: we&rsquo;re talking about a dip in profits, but the fact is that Samsung still made a profit of around &pound;3.6 billion. That is <i>not</i>, in any way, shape or form, a bad performance, and Samsung remains an almighty <i>powerhouse</i> of a company, with the single biggest portfolio of <em>any</em> smartphone manufacturer.</p>
<p>However, Samsung will undoubtedly be aiming to increase those profits again, and there are several key ways they can do that, with executives talking about lowering the marketing spend, and making their phones more competitive, especially in the mid-range; if Samsung could release a mid-range phone that could match the value for money of the Moto G, for example, we predict that phone would fly off shelves!</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will undoubtedly help their bottom line, as well.</p>
<p><strong>And so, to answer the question in the title of this article, no, Samsung is most definitely not losing its edge. Sure, there has been a slump in profits, due to several factors all hitting the company at once, but there overall performance remains strong indeed, and we firmly predict that it won&rsquo;t be long before those profits are back up to where they were 12 months ago! </strong></p>
