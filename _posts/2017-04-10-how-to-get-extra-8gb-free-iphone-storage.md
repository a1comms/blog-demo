<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have more storage on your iPhone? Just think of all the extra apps, photos, and videos you can store. Just imagine all music you can save to your phone. Your Spotify offline playlists would be absolutely endless. In short, it would be the absolute dream.</p>
<p>Well, pretty soon (in just a few minutes actually) your storage dreams could become a reality. In fact, there&rsquo;s a very easy way in which you can bag yourself a whole load of extra storage for the grand sum of&hellip; nothing. It may sound too good to be true, but it&rsquo;s really not. Here&rsquo;s everything that you need to know.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Check how much storage you have</h3>
<p>Okay, first of all, you need to check how much storage you actually have. After all, you can&rsquo;t compare how much <i>extra </i>storage you get until you have a round number of what you have right now. To find out the answer to this all-important question just head to <b>Settings > General > Storage > iCloud Usage</b>. There you should be able to see how much storage you&rsquo;re using just now and how much you have free to use.</p>
<p>Rather than noting all of the above information down, you may want to just take a screenshot. (That way, you can refer back to it afterward and see what the difference is.) You can take the snap by pressing the &lsquo;Power&rsquo; and &lsquo;Home&rsquo; button at the same time. Easy!</p>
<h3>Step 2: Update your iPhone</h3>
<p>The next step may take a fair few minutes, but it will be well worth it. Head to <b>General > Settings > Software Update</b>. The upgrade to iOS 10.3 should already be ready right now, and so you just need to press update. Please note, you will need a WiFi signal and at least 50% of battery life to complete this step.</p>
<p>Of course, the update should take no more than a couple of minutes to complete, depending on your signal. Once it&rsquo;s completed, your phone will restart and you can start reaping the rewards right away!</p>
<h3>Step 3: Check how much storage you have (again)</h3>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve finished downloading the new update, it&rsquo;s time to check how much extra storage you have. There have been varied results from different versions of the iPhone. For example, the iPhone 7 Plus has been said to get up to 7.8GB of extra storage space after the update. How much you get will be completely dependent on what apps and items you have on your phone right now.</p>
<p>So, if you haven&rsquo;t done the update yet (because, really, who can be bothered?), it might just be time to do it. After all, you really shouldn&rsquo;t sniff at a load of free data, right?</p>
