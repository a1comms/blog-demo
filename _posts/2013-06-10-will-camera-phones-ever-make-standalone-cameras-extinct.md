<p><span class="postStandFirst">The smartphone world is dominated by two platforms, by two operating systems. Those platforms are of course Android and iOS, and between them, they account for the vast majority of smartphone sales around the world. There are other platforms of course, such as Windows Phone (as seen in the Nokia Lumia 920 amongst others) and Blackberry 10 (as seen, naturally, in the Blackberry Z10), but many commentators have said that unless the landscape changes drastically, the smartphone war is basically a two horse race, between Android and iOS.</span></p>
<p>When looking around at the world of mobile phones, one would be doing well nowadays to find one that&nbsp;<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;have a camera. Sure, some entry-level pay as you go phones don&rsquo;t have one, but really, the camera is pretty much&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;ubiquitous feature, on both smartphones and feature phones alike.</p>

We&rsquo;ve looked at camera phones before, but there is another interesting question that preoccupies many a commentator, and it&rsquo;s this: will the camera phone ever make standalone cameras go extinct? Or to refine that question even more, since camera phones really can&rsquo;t come close to matching the performance of high-end SLR cameras, will camera phones ever make the&nbsp;<em>point-and-shoot</em>&nbsp;camera extinct?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a lot of people believe it really is possible!</p>
<p>One key advantage that phones have over traditional cameras is the ability to instantly share photos online. Other than something like the Android-powered Samsung Galaxy Camera, no standalone camera can do that, and as it&rsquo;s such a compelling feature, that may well give phones (especially smartphones) the edge in future. Even then, though, camera phones will never be able to match the photographic performance of standalone cameras, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<em>necessarily</em>&nbsp;the case, because that statement assumes that camera phone hardware won&rsquo;t improve, and as we&rsquo;ve seen previously, it most definitely&nbsp;<em>will</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/9005971922_dc9f1c68e0.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>Although it failed to set the market alight, the Nokia 808 PureView showed people what mobile cameras were capable, due to it having a&nbsp;<em>41MP</em>&nbsp;(yes,&nbsp;<em>forty-one</em>&nbsp;megapixels) camera. The images it output weren&rsquo;t 41 megapixel images, of course; the phone used a technique called downsampling, to take the 41 megapixels from the sensor, and convert it to a&nbsp;<em>five</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>eight</em>&nbsp;megapixel photo. The result was a photo that was the same size as camera phones usually produce, but&nbsp;<em>exponentially</em>&nbsp;sharper, to the point where it easily matched standalone cameras.</p>

<p>Sony is rumoured to be doing something similar in one of its upcoming Android phones, and if that is true, it could well become the best camera phone ever made (as it will run on Android, not Symbian, so it won&rsquo;t have the same problem that the Nokia 808 PureView suffered from, namely a clunky OS). Then, of course, there is also the HTC One, which uses new camera hardware, the so-called UltraPixel camera, to increase the amount of light the camera captures.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the really exciting innovation that is plenoptic, or light-field, camera arrays, which uses advanced technology to allow users to change the focus of a photo&nbsp;<em>after it&rsquo;s been taken</em>. A company called Pelican Imaging is working on just such a technology, and since they are being co-funded by Nokia, it seems inevitable that this tech will appear in smartphones in the not too distant future.</p>
<p><strong>Camera phones are evolving all the time, going beyond the concept of mere megapixels. As such, as shocking as it seems, they have the potential to, one day, make the standalone point-and-shoot camera go extinct.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The future&rsquo;s going to be very exciting indeed!</strong></p>
