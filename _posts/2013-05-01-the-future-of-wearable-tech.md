<p><span class="postStandFirst">When Google announced the Google Glass project, more and more manufacturers took note and have now started to produce smart devices and accessories to enhance our everyday lives.</span></p>
<p>Innovation has always been one of the founding corner stones of the mobile phone world with manufacturers constantly striving to bring fresh ideas to the products they release, with wearable technology being just one example.</p>
<p>Although companies such as LG tried to crack the market with its GD910 watch phone, the real race began when Google first showcased the Google Glass project. This being the idea of having wearable tech that allows the user full interaction with their smartphone without having to physically hold it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that manufacturers want 2013 to be the year of&nbsp;<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8544/8699489070_bc55dddcec_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" />wearable tech with some of the biggest names in the industry focusing on the production of smart watches, glasses and health monitoring devices.</p>
<p>The Google Glass project finally hit reality in March, with early adopters test-driving the tech and, although general release is yet to be confirmed, early feedback about the device is positive. Google Glass is a pair of wearable glasses which have a built-in display, camera and touchpad, and pair up with your Android or IOS device. Through the glasses the user can view social updates, news bulletins and local information straight from their handset. The device can even be used to take pictures and videos (through simple voice commands), surf the web, send text messages and even video call friends. Although this device still has some way to go it could essentially revolutionise the way we use our smartphones, the concept of which is both amazing and daunting.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8412/8699472734_022f445c61_m.jpg" width="240" height="150" />When Samsung announced the mighty Galaxy S4 to the world one of the new features they promoted was the inclusion of an app called S-Health. As smartphones become an increasingly important part of our daily lives Samsung want us to still stay active and have included the S-Health app to help us monitor our weight, our diet, help with fitness regimes and even monitor our heart rate. The Korean tech giants have developed a wearable product called the S-Band, consisting of a waterproof band that has built-in sensors and communicates with the Galaxy S4 with information updates about your pulse rate and can even monitor your sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Asides from glasses and health bands, the biggest innovation will be that of the smartwatch. Many have tried and man<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSOH6VyIFKFN9agmzh635RY7bYbMPueYU1YvOs-YVcGPx6-7g13Ng" width="251" height="201" />y have failed in this area, from Sony Ericsson with its Live View device to early contenders such as the Palm Fossil, a PDA-style watch. This year however will see a different side to the technology with smartwatches such as the Im watch and Pebble Watch taking what works and pushing it out to the masses (we're talking our fave features here such as social feed alerts, text messages, music players and the ability to install apps). The real game-changers though will be when tech giants Apple and Samsung enter the arena with the iWatch and Galaxy Watch respectively. Apple's offering could include such functions as integrated Siri facilities, music and even phone call capabilities, whilst Samsung's Galaxy Watch could have the ability to pair with other smart devices, such as the Smart Fridge, with handy alerts to say 'you&rsquo;re out of eggs' !</p>
<p><strong>One certainty is that within the next 12 months some, if not all, of us will be wearing smart accessories thus changing the way we communicate and interact with each other forever.</strong></p>
