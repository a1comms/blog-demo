<p><span class="postStandFirst">You may not be aware that Nokia &ndash; the Finnish technology company that dominated the mobile phone industry in the nineties and early noughties &ndash; has its own highly sophisticated and intuitive maps system. Ladies and gentlemen, meet HERE Maps.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4176 aligncenter" alt="HERE Maps - HERE Drive" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-19-at-11.21.03.png" width="746" height="446" /><span class="caption">Image courtesy of Nokia.com&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Nokia&rsquo;s HERE Maps provides extremely detailed and accurate maps of 135 countries, which can be downloaded on a handset like the Nokia Lumia 1020 and used offline. So even if your coverage is poor and there&rsquo;s no WiFi access, you&rsquo;ll never find yourself at a dead end.</p>
<p>Available for Windows Phone 8 and onwards, HERE Maps will group, sync and save your favourite locations to your smartphone and to here.com. LiveSight allows you to point your device in the direction of surrounding buildings, revealing floating labels with names, categories, ratings and distances to them.</p>

<p>By tapping any public transport stations, you can discover which lines are available and where they go. You can also explore the places you&rsquo;d love to see using street level imagery and panoramic views, which is available in 140 cities worldwide.</p>
<p>HERE Map users can also discover and learn about the top 25 places in a particular area, with photos, reviews and contact information. If you tilt the map slightly, you can even see cities and buildings in 3D! Oh... and it doesn&rsquo;t require any silly glasses.</p>
<p>This dynamic, multifarious app also allows you to pin LiveSight, places, categories and destinations to your Start screen, providing quick, convenient access at all times.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it - any proficient map app needs a competent driving navigation function too, doesn&rsquo;t it? Users can switch effortlessly from HERE Maps to HERE Drive with a simple tap, for voice-guided road navigation with live traffic information.</p>
<p>HERE Drive provides navigation in 96 countries, and it includes visual and audio speed limit warnings to help prevent any unwanted encounters with the authorities. Just like HERE Maps, this feature can be used without any data connection.</p>

<p>In addition, for those who frequent public transport, HERE Transit offers information for over 700 cities, in 50 countries, regarding bus, train, tram and ferry services. Endless timetables and schedules can be confusing, but this app simplifies everything for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve discovered a particularly spectacular park or restaurant, you can let all your friends know where you are by sharing your location on social media sites and through email, all via HERE Maps.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t worry if English isn&rsquo;t your mother tongue; this app is available in 17 different languages. Now you&rsquo;re talking!</strong></p>
