<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony&rsquo;s stunning new flagship device, the Sony Xperia Z2, is now available to buy from us. After taking it for a test ride, it&rsquo;s immediately discernible that the HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s have a very serious challenger to contend with.</span></p>
<p>Although Sony released its&nbsp;Xperia Z1&nbsp;just seven months ago, the Japanese tech company has successfully managed to create a superior iteration in the&nbsp;Xperia Z2, adding some first-rate improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/12972354304_c258f0a7fd.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="297" /></p>
<p>When likening the Xperia Z1 and Z2, the first conspicuous difference is the design. The Xperia Z2 boasts a trimmer build and a lighter weight at 146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2mm and 163g, compared to the Z1 at 144 x 74 x 8.5mm and 170g.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Xperia Z1, the Z2 is cased in a gorgeous aluminium frame and glass back, with smooth, rounded corners, which sits naturally in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2911/13983473660_425785a1b3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The Xperia Z2 offers a Full HD TRILUMINOS 5.2&rdquo;, which, thanks to the introduction of Sony&rsquo;s exclusive Live Colour LED, is brighter and sharper than Z1. Sony is claiming that this new technology ensures the deepest and most intense colour experienced on a smartphone to date.</p>
<p>The screen on the Xperia Z2 has also seen a 0.2 of an inch increase from its predecessor, as Sony&rsquo;s engineers have increased the screen to phone ratio very efficiently, creating a larger viewing platform.</p>

<p>The Xperia Z2 sports the same outstanding 1/2.3&rdquo; 20.7MP camera lens as the Xperia Z1, which, as any Xperia Z series fanboy will know, is capable of capturing some of the finest images imaginable on a smartphone. The front-facing camera, however, has been upgraded to a 2.2MP unit.</p>

<p>Sony has also added a neat background defocus feature to its camera, helping your bring the most important subjects into focus.</p>
<p>The camcorder has seen ample improvements, as it is capable of recording in Ultra High Definition (4K) resolution; to place things in perspective for you, that&rsquo;s four times the detail compared to Full HD 1080p.</p>
<p>SteadyShot helps maintain blur free footage, as it counteracts the natural shake and sway of users&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>Sony is also boasting that the Xperia Z2 is the first smartphone to feature digital noise cancelling technology, cancelling up to 98% of ambient sound. So whether you&rsquo;re commuting to work on a congested train, or sat in your office struggling to crack on, plug in your free MDR-NC31EM headphones and drown the rest of the world out.</p>

<p>In terms of processing performance, the Xperia Z2 has seen a slight facelift. Fitted beneath the luxurious exterior is an ultra-powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 3GB RAM. These, along with the Adreno 330 GPU, allow for remarkably seamless and lag-free smartphone experience.</p>
<p>A slightly larger 3200mAh battery will ensure you get some extra user time, without the nagging worry of recharging your handset.</p>
<p>The Xperia Z series is as durable as ever; the Xperia Z2 is IP55/58 certified, which means it is totally water and dust resistant. You can even capture pictures under water and completely worry free (up to 1.5m), provided you keep all of the ports closed of course!</p>
<p>Keep connected free of tangled wires via NFC (Near Field Communication). The Xperia Z2 will connect to various NFC supported devices, such as cars, headphones, TVs, phones and computers. The Xperia Z2 also features ultra-fast 4G technology, for extremely quick web browsing.</p>
<p><strong>The Sony Xperia Z2 is another remarkable flagship handset that is turning lots of heads in the industry. It truly embodies the best craftsmanship and ingenuity that we&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing from a Sony smartphone.&nbsp;</strong></p>
