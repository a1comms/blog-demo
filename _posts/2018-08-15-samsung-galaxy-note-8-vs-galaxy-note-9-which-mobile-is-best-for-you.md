<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is it time for an upgrade?</span></p>
<p>The brand-new <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-samsung-galaxy-note-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has been announced</a> and, let&rsquo;s be honest, it sounds snazzy.</p>
<p>Packing an upgraded S Pen, some updated features, and a (slightly) larger screen, there&rsquo;s a whole lot to love here.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re thinking about getting a new mobile, what&rsquo;s the difference between this beauty and its predecessor?</p>

<h2>Design: More of the Same</h2>
<p>If you put the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Note 9 side-by-side, you may be hard-pressed to find many differences.</p>
<p>The phones look strikingly similar and it appears that Samsung has stuck with the successful design here. However, there is a difference when it comes to the size of the two Note series devices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18237" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aiT_WZnEgSwpviE_WxIzzl7A7aNxPY4G6Gzy39m2C60hjVXJsd8oZ2Fc76kTagxevcrp1hJDkxVH79S2EeX8j_mY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Rather than getting smaller &ndash; which was once the trend &ndash;&nbsp;the Note phones have only got larger. The Note 9 now weighs in at 201g, compared to the Note 8 at 195g. It&rsquo;s not a huge change, but users might feel it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason for the extra weight, of course. The Galaxy Note 9 boasts a larger display. Which we&rsquo;re just about to get into&hellip;</p>
<h2>Display: Bigger is Better</h2>
<p>When it comes to Galaxy Note smartphones, it&rsquo;s all about the display.</p>
<p>The display on the Note 8 comes in at a whopping 6.3 inches, with the Note 9 larger still at 6.4 inches.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18213" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3nj4qU-HqlW01GjNaWEu_9ZOzObaS3ycV5acBQSGt6PV1ULCNIXfYm5zS7G7SZ38QRoc6yVBLsD9jYI-itxAh_h_w=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Both devices boast a Quad HD+ Super AMOLED screen and, the truth of the matter, is that you&rsquo;re unlikely to notice much, if any, difference between the two in this department.</p>
<p>The Note series of phones has always delivered when it comes to screen size and resolution, so you should have no complaints whichever you choose.</p>
<h2>Features: S Pen Made Better</h2>
<p>One of the biggest upgrades when it comes to the additional features, is the S Pen.</p>
<p>At one time, this was simply a mere stylus, but Samsung has gradually developed and improved on it, culminating in the iteration that is paired with the Note 9.</p>
<p>The latest version of the S Pen is now Bluetooth-enabled and can serve as a remote control. You can use it to remotely take selfies, start and stop music, control presentations and other aspects of your device. Of course, with the S Pen on Note 8, none of the above is possible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18233" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/znsMdqfDYVuRprHc4viHCqWnDxF8WqpASg_gbnyVtYCxPPPOW87gaR1EeF54UKWpiikZrm-Am_tDdj19Z4duYc2N=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Bixby has had a makeover. The AI is smarter this time around and can remember conversations as you&rsquo;re having them. That means that you can ask multiple questions about the same topic and the assistant will recall what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Bixby also links with Samsung partners, like Google and Uber, to make searching easier. The Bixby on the Note 8 wasn&rsquo;t quite this intelligent. (However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that there may be an upgrade available for older versions of the feature later!)</p>
<p>Some features have remained the same. Both support wireless and quick charging. Plus, on both Note series phones, you get a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device. However, on the Note 9, there&rsquo;s a heart rate monitor as well, which is a quirky little extra.</p>
<h2>Camera: Higher Performance</h2>
<p>When it comes to the cameras, the setup is pretty similar. Both Notes have wide angle selfie cameras, coming in at 8MP, and dual 12MP cameras on the rear. That&rsquo;s not to say that the cameras aren&rsquo;t impressive in themselves &ndash;&nbsp;Samsung always has a range of great photography features.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18212" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8sMuty7rWwV2m5NQ_da7fm0gQX8B7F4rxwnFvXd2UdDwhnCsskUnC-1YVcxO6qD4AK1HGfrkM5QTJ2E1_YJBK4o8EA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Note 9 has been treated to a few upgrades, though. There&rsquo;s the dual optical image stabilisation, a higher performance camera sensor, and a better aperture, which means that you should be able to capture great quality images no matter what the lighting situation is, or where you happen to be.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage: Huge Upgrades</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where Samsung has made some serious upgrades. The Note 8 features a Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 8895 chipset, whereas the new and improved Note 9 boasts a Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9810.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. The storage has seen a major boost, too. The Note 8 starts at 64GB for the standard model, while the Note 9 offers 128GB minimum, and can be extended by a further 512GB with a little help from a microSD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18210" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/crPqHKFyXm7ubu194aNBIVsxJMiQBXi3EGDrm9dLsoAAVfGeCtFrBMZMSq05u8aATOJMsbag7JWVfTOqy8B7jGAL=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The battery has been given the special treatment. On the Note 8, the capacity stands at 3300 mAh, which is blown away by the Note 9. The latest device packs a whopping 4000 mAh battery, which is the biggest we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a Note series phone.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Right now, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is on offer at its best ever price with Buymobiles.net. You can pick yours up with a massive 45GB data for just &pound;43 a month. It was &pound;149.99 upfront but is now &pound;0 for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has been upgraded in all manner of ways. From the new S Pen (amazing!) to the changes that the company has made to Bixby.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s worth the extra cash depends on what you value, but you will be getting more for your money with the latest Note phone.</p>
