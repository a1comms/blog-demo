<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Are these the ultimate Apple fanboy accessory?</span></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if Apple made clothes? No? Us neither. But let&rsquo;s pretend for a moment, and consider a world where Apple created fashion pieces, such as, say, trainers. Well, it may surprise you to find that back in the 1980s and 1990s, they did.</p>
<p>Back in the day, Apple would give its employees specialist attire adorned with the Apple logo - the old school, multi-coloured rainbow logo that we all know and love. It was around this time that Apple also made baby grows, sweatshirts, sports clothing, and even accessories. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>If, like the rest of us, this is news to you, you may wonder how you can get your hands on some legitimate Apple attire. Well, the <a href="https://fineart.ha.com/itm/other-art/apple-apple-computer-sneakers-circa-early-1990s-size-9-1-2-these-sneakers-were-produced-by-apple-exclusively-for-t-total-2-items-/a/5323-77001.s?ic4=GalleryView-Thumbnail-071515">Heritage Auction House</a> listed some &lsquo;Apple Corporation Sneakers&rsquo; on sale last Sunday. Yes, Apple fanboys, you can now nab these US-size 9.5 trainers, should you fancy owning a small piece of Apple&rsquo;s grand history.</p>

<p>The plain white trainers just scream vintage sportswear and will look familiar to anyone who lived through the 1980s and 1990s. Of course, there are a few small details that make these shoes really special, from the sleek logo to their &lsquo;chunky&rsquo; style. Retro chic at its very best.</p>
<h2>Money Well Spent?</h2>
<p>So, the question on everyone&rsquo;s lips, is how much will these trainers will set me back? Hold on to your chair, because the auction house estimates that these shoes are worth a whopping $30,000&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s just an estimate. The shoes are now selling for at least $15,000, which is still a hefty sum for a pair of old trainers. Since these are now considered collectable items, and we&rsquo;re guessing that no one&rsquo;s buying them to wear, buying these beauties is basically investing in fine art. Right?</p>
<p>Whether you think the shoes are worth it or not is entirely up to you. Sadly, though, most of us don&rsquo;t happen to have a spare $30,000 lying around for vintage shoes. We can only dream!</p>
