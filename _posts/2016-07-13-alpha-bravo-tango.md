<p>Some time ago Google announced a new project they had in motion in the form of Project Tango, an experiment to capture the world around you and bring in experiences to the eye that you have never seen before.</p>
<p>So what is project Tango?</p>
<p>Project Tango or Google Tango as it known is an augmented reality technology that uses software and a mixture of imaging sensors and cameras to create visual magic on the screen of your smartphone.</p>
<p>Tech giants Lenovo are the forerunners of this technology and the first Tango mainstream device is coming later this year. The device is known as Lenovo Phab 2 PRO.<br />
The handset itself is a monster, beautifully crafted and very powerful, optimized for Tango and featuring a stunning 6.4&rdquo; QHD display. The premium specifications don&rsquo;t stop there, inside the device is a powerful snapdragon processor and 4GB of Ram, 16MP camera and Dolby 5.1 surround sound output.</p>
<p>Tango technology itself is incredible, it makes the impossible possible, for example point your phone to the sky and see all the planets in their full beauty, view an empty room and place furnishings inside to see how it would look as if the items where actually there and look at the screen and see giant dinosaurs in front of you as if they were really there.</p>
<p>This technology is going to bring an amazing experience to your smartphone and as well as virtual reality taking off in a big way, the future is looking incredibly exciting for mobile technologies.</p>
