<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It sometimes feels like every mobile user in the entire world is obsessed with taking selfies. However, when literally everyone is taking selfies, how do you make yours stand out from the pack? Well, if you&rsquo;ve got an iOS device like, say, the iPhone 6S, you have access to an app called MSQRD, which will do that for you!</span></p>
<p>Produced by Masquerade Technologies Inc (which should give an idea how to pronounce the app&rsquo;s name), MSQRD is a clever little app that lets you take photos and videos of yourself, and add effects to them. So, you could add a crying animation to your eyes, or morph your face into that of a dog, or give yourself big anime girl eyes (which may end up looking really creepy, when you fall facefirst into the uncanny valley), or turn yourself into Steve from Minecraft.</p>

<p>Now, you may be thinking, &ldquo;But wait, hang on, loads of apps do that,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d be right. However, there&rsquo;s a crucial difference, with MSQRD: you can add those effects to <em>video</em> selfies as well as still images, and the effects will line themselves up with your face, and then <em>move when you do</em>.</p>
<p>So instead of just sending someone a photo where you&rsquo;ve painted yourself as a dog, for example, you can send them a <em>video</em> clip where you&rsquo;ve physically <em>become</em> a dog (with the longer snout and everything). And <em>that</em> is rather clever.</p>

<p>The key to the whole thing is 3D face tracking. The app tracks loads of reference points on your face (doing so automatically instead of needing loads of motion-capture dots on your face like you see on movie sets), and then it maps the movement of the 3D model/effect over your own face&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>It is, essentially, a simplified version of the kind of technology used in <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> to bring <em>Gollum</em> to life, and as a result, it is really very cool indeed. The best bit, though, is the price.</p>
<p>Quite simply, there <em>isn&rsquo;t </em>one. Yes, because Masquerade Technologies Inc developed the app as a showcase for the company&rsquo;s <em>real</em> bread and butter (the actual face tracking software and development kit, itself), MSQRD is completely <em>free</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So, you get access to clever technology, to wow/freak out your friends, and you don&rsquo;t pay a penny for it. And thus, as long as you have an iOS device (yeah, there&rsquo;s no version for Android users, alas) there&rsquo;s really no reason not to try MSQRD. Get it downloaded from iTunes, and give it a try today! </strong></p>
