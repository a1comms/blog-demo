<p>Losing your phone can be infuriating to say the least. This one gadget contains everything from your emails, to your calendar events, to your much-loved holiday snaps (#Ibiza2016). It&rsquo;s basically your life. So, it makes sense that you&rsquo;d want to do all you can to recover it. And as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, we have some tips to help you find your lost or stolen phone. That's because the modern smartphone is a thing of wonder, packed full of handy little features that can help you track it. So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at how you can find <em>your</em> phone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14642" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7bb0IBZFSMMPXcz9W95l1WbCwAUaCyoTvhV2ewjMVhqQd6TXDxWxlg6zIfhVjzHI8-0itgBz-6bMrqUrKwSgxIDc=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Note: </em><em>If you think your phone has been stolen, we do not recommend you go looking for it yourself. Trying to do so could be dangerous and &nbsp;really not worth it. Instead, you can track your stolen phone and report the theft to the police, who may be able to use the information to help you recover it.</em></p>
<h2>How to Find Lost Android Phones</h2>
<p>Did you know that you can track your Android phone remotely? You just need to have the foresight to make sure that your mobile is locatable, before you lose it. So, if you&rsquo;re reading this right now and your phone is by your side, here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p><strong>Go to Google Settings > Security > and activate &lsquo;Remotely locate this device&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve completed the above, you&rsquo;ll be able to find your phone should you have the misfortune of losing it. Or, worse, have it stolen.</p>
<p>All you need to do is head to <a href="https://www.google.com/android/find" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android.com/find</a> where you can login and retrieve a real-time location for your lost or stolen phone, literally pinpointing its whereabouts at any given moment.</p>
<h2>How to Find Lost iPhones</h2>
<p>So, what about if you&rsquo;ve lost your iPhone? Well, then the process for finding it is actually pretty similar to Android phones. Again, before you lose your iPhone, you need to make sure that it&rsquo;s all geared up for remote tracking. This is essential. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings > iCloud > and activate &lsquo;Find My iPhone&rsquo; </strong></p>
<p>You also need to make sure that you&rsquo;ve turned on &lsquo;Location Services&rsquo; (which you&rsquo;ll find in your Privacy settings). When you need to find your lost iPhone, go to <a href="https://www.icloud.com/find" target="_blank" rel="noopener">icloud.com/find</a> and sign in to track its location.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you happen to have any other Apple devices (such as a MacBook or an iPad), there&rsquo;s another way to go. You can sign into the Find My iPhone app with your Apple ID, and see your iPhone&rsquo;s whereabouts there too.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can use your iCloud account to locate a lost iPad or MacBook. Easy!</p>
