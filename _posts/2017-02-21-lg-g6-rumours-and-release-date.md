<p>Ready for a totally new smartphone experience? Well, the South Korean tech giant, LG, is all set to release a new flagship phone, confirmed as LG G6.</p>
<p>Right now, there are a load of rumours about the hotly awaited 2017 device, but what should you believe? Here&rsquo;s all the latest gossip, from the LG G6 release date, to the features you can expect (or hope) to see.</p>
<p><iframe style="display: block !important; height: 458px !important;" src="//renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/58adaeb37e8066d7630d5c81" width="100%" height="458" frameborder="0" scrolling="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>LG G6 Release Date</h2>
<p>While LG G6 has been rumoured for quite some time, we now have concrete details about the announcement. The LG press conference is all set for midday on the 26th February in Barcelona, at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017. During the conference, LG officials will stake to stage to unveil LG G6, as well some more details around its availability in the UK market. Hurrah!</p>

<h2>LG G6 Design Rumours</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping for something new from the tech giant this time around, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. Some of the hottest LG G6 leaks show a phone like no other LG handset.</p>
<p>There are two main rumours here. Either the phone will be made out of tempered glass or it will have some kind of metallic body. Both of the above would make for an ultra-stylish and contemporary handset. Plus, the latest (and, frankly, clearest) image of the phone appears to show a brushed metal back.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13269" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gH_TGN-wcd1bDgSmsRpa_GAPu9kgeFq7goINKBjB6loENrogoVNAV6-oXNxzIyTrhaAPJCZ7F_bGLYIBbPsqw3Qf=s0" width="600" height="720" /></p>
<p>So, what about the size? Well, another LG G6 leak suggests that the size will be 148.8 x 72.3 x 8.3mm. Surprisingly, that&rsquo;s just a little thicker than the G5. With many of the latest flagship phones getting thinner and thinner, it seems odd that LG would want to go in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the teaser video featured the word &lsquo;waterproof&rsquo; loud and clear, and of course the video below gives further confirmation, if you needed it. Whatever dimensions and materials LG choose, it will have to make sure that the outer body is as watertight as possible.</p>

<h2>LG G6 Camera Rumours</h2>
<p>While for some time the South Korean giant was keeping quiet about the LG G6 camera, the cat is very much out of the bag. In a recent <a href="http://social.lge.co.kr/newsroom/mc/lg_g6_camera_0220/">blog post</a> (which TechRadar kindly translated), the manufacturer gave fans an insight into what its planning. Apparently, its latest snapper is all set to sport not one, but two 13MP rear sensors.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6kVYjqWPXE?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>LG G6 will also feature a rather impressive wide-angle camera with a whopping 125-degree view range. This field of view is closer to the human eye&rsquo;s, which means that pictures will give a more life-like representation than ever before!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13272" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6_knNhMusuGJ6lolFj1yx7Y8auKCcjhfqSlx-JbRfZ1D6t7Y2-wn5uP8O8Mg2ZvAKrmlmLEVJ1-aryJFiRiLvj8=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, what does that mean for the average user? Well, LG claims that they will be increasing the resolution of the wide-angle camera. On previous models, we've seen a mere 8MP resolution for this type of camera. However, with the release of the LG G6, we&rsquo;ll be treated to a huge 13MP resolution cam. That should certainly change the quality of pictures taken in the wide-angle setting. What's more, the selfie camera will also have a 100 degrees of view, which will please the Instagram-loving community.</p>
<h2>LG G6 Power Rumours</h2>
<p>So, what power will the handset be packing then? According to the most shared LG G6 rumours, LG is building upwards from the G5. That former flagship had a generous 4GB of RAM, which means we can hope for even greater things from the G6, possibly in the region of a whopping 6GB of RAM. If LG wants to really compete, it would be a smart.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IVgB2FFKHM?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Like the top smartphones on the market right now, LG G6 will house a Snapdragon 821 chipset. That&rsquo;ll give it a whole load of power, able to support the likes of Google Daydream View VR Games. (Still, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that Snapdragon 835 is set to launch and it&rsquo;s unlikely that LG G6 will have this latest version of the chipset.)</p>

<h2>LG G6 Features Rumours</h2>
<p>But enough about the power, camera, or even the look of the phone, let&rsquo;s get down to the rumoured LG G6 features. Well, the latest LG G6 news is pretty comprehensive in this area. We can expect a host of rather nifty little capabilities, apparently, starting with the inclusion of Google Assistant or Alexa. Having a personal assistant in your pocket that understands what you say&hellip; What could be better than that?</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13270" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-13270 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ycZadVe-lucs-9Pw2P21OUH2bwtziBMURSm42x-_R_bXurq7hIYOHqgJBvYQUt9AjxZrWED2PtdjCt3o2eeTseI5yw=s0" width="600" height="338" /> Alexa the personal assistant on Amazon Echo[/caption]</p>
<p>In other LG G6 news, the phone will probably boast super-fast wireless charging (which, let&rsquo;s face it, is what we all really want at this point!), a fingerprint scanner, and improved audio. Needless to say that all of these things would be welcome additions to the next LG phone.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s been absolutely no mention of the phone ditching the headphone jack, which means that you don&rsquo;t have to rush out to get wireless earphones <em>just </em>yet.</p>
<h2>LG G6 Display Rumours</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another area where we don&rsquo;t need to rely on the LG G6 rumours. That&rsquo;s because LG officials have already come out and confirmed that the G6 will sport a 5.7-inch QHD LCD display.</p>
<p>Also, a recent photo leak (sourced from TechRadar), shows that the phone will have a 90% screen-to-body ratio. With phone screens growing every year, it&rsquo;s good to see manufacturers are getting smart on how they use the space, rather than increasing the overall handset size.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13271" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-13271 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0VBOcw4BrSroqKGpI1vrkpoOpPrbeyzMm2GJLH-sRWTCC5m63TpfcAzEh4gypMll5d4mq1QI4LpzqlmciPcOKY3LzA=s0" width="600" height="387" /> LG G6 Leak | source: TechRadar[/caption]</p>
<p>By the looks of the LG G6 leak above, it will feature an always-on display, showing important notifications and the time at a glance. This was present (and popular) on the LG G5.</p>
<h2>LG G6 Pricing Rumours</h2>
<p>So, if you want to get your hands on LG G6, how much will it cost you? Well, when it comes to the price of this device, we&rsquo;ve got the news right from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>The good people at LG have already stated that the phone will be around the same price as the LG G5 when it first hit stores. That means that we can expect to see the LG G6 on sale for between &pound;400-&pound;490. That&rsquo;s amazing value for a flagship phone filled with top-of-the-range specs.</p>
