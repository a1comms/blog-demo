<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">A bendable smartphone screen is coming...</span></p>
<p>Can you imagine casually folding up your smartphone and sliding it into your pocket? I don&rsquo;t mean just closing a flip phone (we&rsquo;re not in the early 2000s anymore!), I mean literally<em> bending </em>the screen to make the device smaller.</p>
<p>This may sound a little odd, but that could well be the future of smartphones...</p>
<p>The reason is simple. Bendable screens are supposedly the next big thing in tech, and if the reports are to be believed, some of the major phone manufacturers racing to launch one.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 64%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9IgKFWcOzJznN86A" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether the screens would simply bend a little or fold right up, remains to be seen, but you have to admit that it sounds pretty cool.</p>
<p>Apple has teamed up with the likes of LG to create a foldable iPhone display, according to rumours in a new report from South Korea. The screen-making subsidiary of LG will allegedly be working on this project, alongside the Innotek team, who will be developing a flexible circuit to go inside the screen itself.</p>

<p>Rumour has it that the new bendable iPhone will be set to launch in 2020. What&rsquo;s more, the report claims that LG completed its bendable prototype two to three years ago. So, presumably, LG has since been perfecting the technology.</p>
<p>At the Android end of the market, we know Samsung has been developing its own foldable phone. The company&rsquo;s boss previously confirmed ambitions to launch in 2018, according to a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-the-story-of-samsungs-foldable-phone-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from TechRadar. If it manages to pull it off, Samsung may release a foldable phone two years before Apple!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, the powers at Apple have made moves to gain some independence from the likes of Samsung Display as soon as they can. With LG launching a new factory in Korea by 2019, reports suggest that Apple will be investing directly into the new venture. Doing so would mean Apple no longer needs to rely on Samsung for screens, and could then attempt to out-do the competition.</p>
<p><em>Ready, set, develop! </em></p>
