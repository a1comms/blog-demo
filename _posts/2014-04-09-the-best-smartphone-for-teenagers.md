<p><span class="postStandFirst">A parents' guide to buying the best smartphone for teenagers...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3792/13739837574_27466fa471.jpg" width="500" height="446" /></strong></p>
<p>Smartphones are everywhere these days, even in the hands of teenagers, despite what some old, curmudgeonly types might say about kids not needing smartphones. Teenagers, quite simply, like smartphones.</p>
<p>However, choosing a smartphone for your baby (that&rsquo;s &lsquo;baby&rsquo; in a <em>metaphorical</em> sense, naturally; toddlers traditionally don&rsquo;t have much use for 4G data access or text messages) is where it can potentially get more complex, so to give yo some pointers, let&rsquo;s take a look at what would make a good phone for teenagers.</p>
<h2>Get it in your name, so you can monitor the bills</h2>
<p>Whichever phone you go for, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get the phone in your name, especially if you&rsquo;re buying a monthly contract phone. That way, you can monitor the bills, and make sure they&rsquo;re not spending thousands of pounds on in-app purchases. On that note, it can also be a good idea to turn off in-app purchases, so they can&rsquo;t run up huge bills that way, a feature that iOS (found on the iPhone 5c), Android (on the likes of the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>), and Windows Phone all offer.</p>
<h2>However, learn to <em>trust</em> your kids</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/13739472153_c5a9252063.jpg" width="500" height="374" /></span></strong></p>
<p>While features like turning off in-app purchases can be a good idea, it&rsquo;s perhaps a better idea to teach your children <em>why</em> spending thousands of pounds to buy lollipops in <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> is probably a bit of a bad idea.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your kids run wild, obviously, but instil a good sense of right and wrong in them, and you&rsquo;ll find you don&rsquo;t have to worry about going through their phone to check who&rsquo;s contacting them, which is bound to be less stressful for you.</p>
<h2>Get something hard-wearing</h2>
<p>The thing about teenagers is that they&rsquo;ve not been alive as long as adults, and thus have less inherent knowledge of the value (as in cost, both emotional and financial) of things. As such, they may be less careful about looking after their phone, so getting a phone with good build quality is probably a very good idea indeed.</p>
<h2>Ignore the 'cool' factor</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/13739387555_2a9934061c.jpg" width="500" height="383" /></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s one particular phone which many teenagers would ask for (and it starts with an &ldquo;i&rdquo;), so now&rsquo;s the perfect time to teach them that peer pressure isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be (especially when <em>you&rsquo;re</em> the one who&rsquo;s paying for the phone)! What&rsquo;s <em>cool</em> can change on a daily basis, so it might be better to go for long-lasting <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hmm</em>, a phone that&rsquo;s well-made and powerful, but that actually costs very little...</p>
<h2>Basically, get them a Moto G</h2>
<p>Well, here we go again; yet another demographic for whom the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/motorola/motorola-moto-g?adnetwork=fcbk">Moto G</a> is utterly perfect! Seriously, it&rsquo;s really powerful, it&rsquo;s got a gorgeous screen, and it looks really rather sexy, and <em>yet</em>, it costs very, <em>very</em> little to actually buy. Plus, it runs on Android, so there are options there to control their access to what the phone can do, and there are apps to remotely wipe the device if it gets lost or stolen.</p>
<p><strong>So, essentially, if you&rsquo;re looking for the best phone for a teenager, then the runaway winner is the brilliant Moto G.</strong></p>
