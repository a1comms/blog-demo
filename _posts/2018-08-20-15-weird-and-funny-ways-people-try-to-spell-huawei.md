<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">How many times have YOU got this wrong?</span></p>
<p>Once an underdog of the smartphone world, Huawei has come a long, long way over the years. The Chinese mega-brand recently <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/huawei-overtakes-apple-to-become-the-second-largest-mobile-manufacturer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took over from Apple</a> to become the second largest mobile manufacturer in the world. Needless to say, there are few people in the modern world who have yet to come across this brand of smartphone.</p>
<p>That leaves one burning question: Why can&rsquo;t <em>any </em>of us spell its name? Whether you&rsquo;re looking for Huawei deals or finding out about their latest flagship, Googling the brand is the quickest way to get what you need.</p>
<p>However, many of us simply don&rsquo;t know how to spell Huawei at all. Here are some of the funniest ways our customers spell the brand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hawaway</li>
<li>Hawuai</li>
<li>Huiey</li>
<li>Hueweu</li>
<li>Huwawei</li>
<li>Huwawea</li>
<li>Hawaia</li>
<li>Huewie</li>
<li>Wahwei</li>
<li>Huwaiau</li>
<li>Hawawai</li>
<li>Huaihi</li>
<li>Hewawei</li>
<li>Huwaiwai</li>
<li>Wowweee</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Huiey (nope!) or Wowwee (double nope!), there are oh-so-many ways to get this wrong. Learning how to spell Huawei couldn&rsquo;t be easier. It&rsquo;s only six little letters long, after all. Here&rsquo;s a quick mnemonic device to help you remember it:</p>
<p><strong>H</strong>ear<strong> U</strong>nicorns <strong>A</strong>s <strong>W</strong>e <strong>E</strong>xplore <strong>I</strong>celand</p>
<p>The phrase is silly enough to stick in your mind. The next time you&rsquo;re wondering how to spell Huawei, just repeat this little sentence to yourself and you should have no problem. It might even help to picture some unicorns roaming around Iceland. (I&rsquo;m visualising the shop, but you can imagine the country too!)</p>
<h2>How to Pronounce "Huawei"</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the spelling down but there&rsquo;s another thing to tackle. How to pronounce Huawei often stumps people. Ask anybody out there and you&rsquo;ll see that many of us are simply bamboozled by the word and how it should sound.</p>

<p>Luckily, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place if you want to learn something new. The right way to say this word is &lsquo;wah-way.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s right, there are just two syllables. Give it a go for yourself. Here&rsquo;s a quick video that should help you along the way:</p>
