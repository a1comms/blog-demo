<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Roll on February 2019!</span></p>
<p>Next year&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress (MWC) could be an epic event. Both Samsung and LG may be revealing brand new mobile phones at the tech show, according to a report by the Korea Herald.</p>
<p>The leak suggests that there will be some exciting technological developments coming our way at the MWC 19, which will be taking place 25-28 February.</p>
<h2>The Rumoured 5G Ready Samsung Galaxy S10</h2>
<p>So, what can we expect? Well, one of the biggest theories is that Samsung will be launching a special edition 5G version of the Galaxy S10.</p>
<p>Since we already know that <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-is-launching-the-uks-first-5g-mobile-from-this-manufacturer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5G is the future of mobile phones</a>, this should come as no big surprise. As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you eagerly awaiting the new year, the device may also boast a whopping 6.7-inch screen, alongside a massive 1TB storage.</p>

<h2>The Rumoured 5G Ready LG G7 ThinQ</h2>
<p>The second rumour that&rsquo;s been floating about recently is that LG will also be getting a slice of the 5G action.</p>
<p>Yes, according to the same report, the LG G7 ThinQ will be getting something of a makeover ahead of MWC 19. The device was first launched this year but, right now, it only has 4G capabilities.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the minimalist design and advanced features all at a great price mean the phone has gone down a storm with many users.</p>
<h2>When Will These 5G Ready Mobiles Be Available</h2>
<p>While both devices may be announced at the MWC in February 2019, there&rsquo;s nothing to say that they will be released at the same time. In fact, the report suggests that the 5G versions of each phone won&rsquo;t be available until March 2019.</p>
<p>However, since <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-announces-the-cities-that-will-get-5g-next-year">5G hasn't yet been rolled out around the UK</a>, the chances are that the infrastructure won&rsquo;t be widely available until the summer. That means that should you get a 5G handset, you may have to wait a while to use the feature. Patience is a virtue, right?</p>
