<p><span class="postStandFirst">EE has launched a new service, called 4G+, in selected areas of London. Using new technology, 4G data speed has been vastly increased, and although it can only currently be used with two specific phones, it may one day change the way Britain accesses the Internet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5990 aligncenter" alt="EE 4G+" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/15699585171_31cdb7bd13_k-686x1024.jpg" width="686" height="1024" /></p>
<p>The 4G network is being rolled out to more and more places round the country, but now, EE has taken the next step, with a brand new project that the network has flipped on in London.</p>
<p>This new service is called 4G+, and its activation has made EE one of the fastest 4G networks in the world, with speeds up to a whopping 150 megabytes per second (Mbps)!</p>
<p>The new service takes advantage of a innovative technology called LTE-Advanced, which works by taking all of the frequencies that carry a 4G signal and combining them into one immense super-signal, in a process called <i>frequency aggregation</i>. Thus, more data is able to travel through the super-signal, and the speed has been <i>vastly</i> increased, up to that enormous figure of 150Mbps.</p>
<p>Fotis Karonis, CTO at EE, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re building a network for the future. We&rsquo;re making sure that there is enough speed, enabled by enough capacity, to let our growing 4GEE customer base do all the amazing things that are just breaking through now &ndash; 4K video over 4G, wearable technology, and increasingly sophisticated mobile business apps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capacity is the lifeblood of a good mobile service, and we&rsquo;re adding more here to give our customers the best possible mobile experience, now and into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, however, a downside (at least for the time being): there are currently only two phones that can take advantage of this new 4G+ service, namely the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the fashion-conscious Samsung Galaxy Alpha. You&rsquo;ll need to buy one of these handsets, and an EE 4G SIM, to use the new service.</p>
<p>For now, 4G+ is available in selected places in London, including Shoreditch, Old Street, Southbank, Soho, Westminster and Kensington. EE wants to roll 4G+ out to other locations, such as Manchester and Birmingham, by June 2015.</p>
<p><strong>And so, we&rsquo;re not quite ready to ditch our wired communications infrastructure just yet, but who knows? If 4G+ spreads across the whole country, we might be able to do just that!&nbsp;</strong></p>
