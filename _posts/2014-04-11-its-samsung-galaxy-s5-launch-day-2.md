<p><span class="postStandFirst">Today is the day that many have been waiting for... the official Samsung Galaxy S5 launch!</span></p>
<p>After months of rumours and anticipation, which were made all the more intense when the phone was officially unveiled, it&rsquo;s finally here. Yes, folks, the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> has finally come amongst us!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already done a full review of just how good a phone it is, so let&rsquo;s just take a quick look at the key point once again; if you&rsquo;re undecided on whether to get one, then this little run-down might help you make a decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/13776124083_299aecdfbd.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>For starters, there&rsquo;s power, because the Samsung Galaxy S5 has <em>bags</em> of it. Similar to 2014&rsquo;s other big superphones (the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Duo Camera-wielding HTC One M8), the Galaxy S5 uses a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, although in this phone, it&rsquo;s clocked to a faster speed (namely 2.5GHz). It also has 2GB of RAM, and the end result of the processor and the memory is a phone that&rsquo;s lightning fast, and superbly responsive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/13776477014_c379f5303c.jpg" width="500" height="119" /></p>
<p>And on top of that, it&rsquo;s a gorgeous phone, too, with a sleek, slim body and a glorious 5.1-inch 1080p screen. The dimpled backplate does more than just making the phone look unique, though; it also provides a kind of &ldquo;non-slip&rdquo; surface, that makes the phone easier to keep a grip on, especially if it gets wet.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, that could feasibly happen, because the Samsung Galaxy S5 is water-resistant!</p>
<p>Combine all of that with some extra neat little features like a PayPal-certified fingerprint scanner, and you end up with a device that helps to redefine the term &ldquo;superphone&rdquo;. And now, you can get one for yourself, so what are you waiting for?<strong> </strong></p>
