<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung appears to have accidentally leaked information of the unconfirmed Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, just over two weeks before its&nbsp;expected announcement.</span></p>
<p>The clanger, which appears to have been dropped by Samsung&rsquo;s developer site, shows the name &lsquo;S7 Edge&rsquo; detailed next to other, already existing, Edge devices.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8358" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="size-full wp-image-8358" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-leaked-confirmation.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-leaked-confirmation.jpg alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge leaked confirmation&rdquo;>" width="1024" height="575" /> A screenshot allegedly taken from developer.samsung.com by Dutch site Galaxy Club, which purports to confirm the existence of a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.[/caption]</p>
<p>According to Mashable, the error was first picked up by Dutch site Galaxy Club, who were too agile for Samsung, and managed to capture screenshots before the &lsquo;leaked&rsquo; information was removed.</p>
<p>This comes just days after Samsung teased us with its official &lsquo;Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016&rsquo; preview, in preparation for the pre-MWC press event where Samsung has confirmed it will unveil its next Galaxy smartphone(s).</p>

<p>Other images shared by Evan Blass on Twitter reveal a more complete picture, displaying a front and rear render of the rumoured Samsung Galaxy S7, next to its bigger sibling, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.</p>

The background pattern was added by ourselves." width="800" height="534" /> This is an unofficial image, purporting to show Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.[/caption]</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_8360" align="aligncenter" width="620"]<img class="wp-image-8360 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/s7-leaks2.png" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/s7-leaks2.png alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy S7 leaked photos of rear&rdquo;>" width="620" height="338" /> This is an unofficial image, purporting to show Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.[/caption]</p>
<p>If we entertain that the above pictures are genuine, then we can see that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge share a very similar design to the current Samsung Galaxy S6 models.</p>
<p>However, the home button curves more abruptly&nbsp;at the edges, and the back plate looks more convex. We&rsquo;ll hold off on too much analysis of these pictures, and wait for the real deal from Samsung on 21<sup>st</sup> February.</p>
