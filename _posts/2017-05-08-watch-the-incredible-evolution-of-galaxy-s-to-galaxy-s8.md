<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We&rsquo;ve come a long, long road together&hellip; (video below)</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that the world has changed a lot over the last seven years. 2010 may not sound like all that long ago, but just think of how far we&rsquo;ve come. Back then, the original members of One Direction were still together, Creme Eggs used the same classic and much-loved recipe, and no one had yet coined the word &lsquo;Brexit.&rsquo; It was a simpler time.</p>
<p>The technological world was seemingly much simpler, too. This was the year that <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung">Samsung</a>&nbsp;released its very first Galaxy handset, named the Samsung Galaxy S. Needless to say, it was a far cry from the snazzy flagship phones of today. With a crude plastic coating and running Android 2.3 Gingerbread 2.3, it was slow and clunky by modern day standards.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13774" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2_2ArGaH4kzf7Kb-Dx2pnUTSACkyVoaJboq7yP4gJ1__OBNefHaaV362FGZB6frtVHY23sBYeIZASaLu57uqR1Kl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But, of course, this was merely Samsung&rsquo;s first attempt at a phone that would eventually woo the masses. Over the last seven years, the tech giant has had many more attempts and it has really upped its game in recent years. So much so, that Samsung is now the most popular Android smartphone manufacture in the world.</p>
<p>With the release of Samsung Galaxy S8 in April, the company cemented themselves as one of the greatest phone manufacturers of our time. It looks like a phone from the future, and yet here it is now in the present. The flagship device is one of the most stunning we&rsquo;ve ever seen, almost bezeless and boasting a glass-metal design like no other.</p>

<p>Of course, Samsung Galaxy S8 was a huge leap from the original Samsung Galaxy S. But, what happened in between? If that&rsquo;s the question on your mind right about now, we have just the thing for you. One YouTuber, EverythingApplePro, has created a video showing the incredible evolution of the phone. From start to finish, it&rsquo;s honestly mind-blowing how far this product has come over the years.</p>
<p>Watch the video for yourself and you&rsquo;ll see just how much has changed over the years. It&rsquo;s crazy to think that smartphones are developing at such a pace. Who knows what the next seven years will bring, eh?</p>
