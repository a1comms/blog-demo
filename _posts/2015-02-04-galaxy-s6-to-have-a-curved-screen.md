<p><strong><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung">Samsung</a> has released a teaser image for its March 1st Unpacked event, which shows a phone that clearly has a <em>curved</em> edge. It remains to be seen whether this is the Samsung Galaxy S6, however, or a new superphone that we haven&rsquo;t had any hints about yet...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6218" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/samsung-unpacked-2015-teaser.jpg" alt="samsung-unpacked-2015-teaser" width="630" height="315" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rapidly approaching March 1st, the date upon which Samsung is all set to unveil its latest, greatest superphone, oft-rumoured to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, the sequel to the wildly popular and utterly brilliant Samsung Galaxy S5.</p>
<p>And so, Samsung has taken to <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile/status/562407356378918912">its Twitter feed</a> to to tease the world with &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo;; it turns out that what <em>is </em>next may very well be <em>another</em> smartphone with a curved screen, just like the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t have any <em>direct</em> confirmation that this is the Galaxy S6, as the image Samsung has released simply shows the curved edge of a phone, and not a great deal else. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that there have been numerous stating that the Galaxy S6 will indeed have a curved edge, with a wraparound screen. While it is possible that this rumour will pan out, though, we must of course take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible, after all, that the Galaxy S6 will be released alongside <em>another</em> phone, and that this hypothetical other phone will be the one with the wraparound. There is precedent for this: the aforementioned Galaxy Note Edge was released alongside the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p><strong>Still, we do know that <em>something</em> is going to be unveiled at the Samsung Unpacked event on March 1st, and based on previous years, it&rsquo;s very likely that it&rsquo;s going to blow our minds. We&rsquo;ll be watching this one very closely, to see just how <em>much</em> it blows our minds. Stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
