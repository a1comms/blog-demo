<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Android vs. Apple. Which will be crowned king?</span></p>
<p>Choosing your next smartphone is no small feat. Let&rsquo;s face it, you&rsquo;re likely to hold onto the device for the next 12-24 months, which means that the decision is a crucial one.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade right now, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with one of the latest flagships. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what both the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> and the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a> have to offer.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>When it comes to the design, both the Galaxy S10 and iPhone Xs are playing the same game. It&rsquo;s minimalism all the way &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking almost bezeless looks, curved edges, and a massive screen without any buttons.</p>
<p>However, there are some tell-tale differences between the two leading phones.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S10 design is slick and sleek. Rather than having a notch on the front, there&rsquo;s a punch hole style cam tucked in the corner, which many will love.</p>
<p>On the back, you&rsquo;ve got a horizontal strip of lenses along with the iconic Samsung logo below it. All in all, it&rsquo;s a cool look. The device is available in green, white, black and blue.</p>
<p>Next up, we&rsquo;ve got the iPhone Xs, which boasts an equally elegantly simple design.</p>
<p>The front is nearly all-screen apart from the small notch at the top. On the rear, there&rsquo;s a small vertical strip in the left-hand corner. Of course, there&rsquo;s also the Apple logo in the middle of the device and the word &lsquo;iPhone&rsquo; directly below it. It comes in a space grey, gold or silver finish.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Boasting a 6.1-inch Infinity-O Dynamic AMOLED display, Samsung Galaxy S10 is quite a show-stopper. There&rsquo;s also the taller 19.9 aspect ratio, which means that you can get a widescreen experience when you&rsquo;re watching shows. It&rsquo;s a great offering.</p>
<p>The iPhone Xs gives you a slightly smaller 5.8-inch Super Retina OLED display with a notch across the top of the screen. It also has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which offers a comfortable viewing experience.</p>
<p>To be honest, there&rsquo;s not much between the two phones, although when pushed the S10 does come out on top in terms of raw pixels. In terms of the actual display quality, we&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a tie.</p>
<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk cameras. Samsung adorned their S-series phones with a serious array of camera setups. The S10 has as a triple-lens offering &ndash; a 12MP lens, 12MP zoom cam, and 16MP ultra-wide-angle camera. On the front, there&rsquo;s also a 10MP selfie camera, which sports 2D facial recognition. Impressive.</p>
<p>iPhone Xs has a duo-lens setup on the rear. However, that&rsquo;s not to say that it can&rsquo;t be used to take professional-style photographs. It can. The device has a 12MP wide angle lens along with a 12MP telephoto lens. Plus, you&rsquo;ve got the optical image stabilisation and Smart HDR. Add that to True Depth camera on the front, with its 3D facial recognition feature, and it could be a real winner here.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The star of the show, as far as Samsung is concerned, has to be the ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanner. This new security tech is sure to turn a few heads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new interface called the One UI, which is extra user-friendly and should make the device faster. Bixby Routines remembers your phone usage habits, e.g. what time of day you usually check Instagram, and uses that information to make the experience speedier. Neat.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, Apple has opted for Face ID, with no fingerprint scanner in sight. It&rsquo;s interesting to see two of the leading smartphones choose such strikingly different pathways.</p>
<p>There have also been upgrades to Siri, Apple Pay and more. Plus, the inclusion of the Screen Time app helps users to take more control of their smartphone usage &ndash; something we all need.</p>
<h2>Performance and Power</h2>
<p>With 8GB RAM and the powerful Exynos 9820 chipset, Samsung Galaxy S10 should be one of the fastest phones on the market.</p>
<p>The device also has a large enough 3400 mAh battery, which should last for hours on end. However, if you are running low, there&rsquo;s the wireless charging 2.0. There&rsquo;s also the brand new Wireless PowerShare feature, meaning you can juice up other wireless gadgets using the back of the Galaxy S10 as a power pad.</p>
<p>Of course, iPhone Xs has the wholly futuristic sounding A12 Bionic chip with machine learning and super-quick processing. However, the RAM amount is lower than that of the S10; half the size, in fact, at 4GB. The device is fitted with a 2658 mAh, which should be enough to keep you going all day long.</p>
<p>It also has wireless charging alongside fast charging capabilities, allowing you to get up to 50% charge in 30 minutes.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the down-low about the iPhone Xs and Samsung Galaxy S10, let&rsquo;s talk money.</p>
<p>How much is each of these flagship phones going to cost you? iPhone Xs comes in at &pound;999 SIM free. If you&rsquo;d rather opt for the S10, the SIM free price is more affordable at &pound;799.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll probably want yours on a contract deal. At the time of writing, iPhone Xs is available with a massive 60GB data on EE for just &pound;58 a month at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buymobiles.net</a>.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S10 could be yours for just &pound;48 a month, with a sizeable 50GB of data on the EE network. Again, this amazing price is available over at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buymobiles.net</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which smartphone should you choose? Well, it&rsquo;s a tricky one. Both the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the iPhone Xs have a whole load to offer, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>With the iPhone, you&rsquo;ve got Face ID, that True Depth camera and extras including Screen Time. Then again, the Samsung has a triple-lens rear camera offering, PowerShare and a new UI look. Tough choice!</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s one that you can most certainly make. Weigh up your options and pick the phone that suits your needs.</p>
