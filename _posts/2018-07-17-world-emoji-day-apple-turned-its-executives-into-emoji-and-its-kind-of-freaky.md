<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Some of these look, erm, intense.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s officially (according to the internet) World Emoji Day. Yes, if you logged onto Facebook this morning (because, of course, you did!), you will have noticed a little message at the top of your newsfeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today we celebrate the tiny characters who have changed the way we communicate. From all of us at Facebook, we hope you and your friends have an emoji-filled day!&rdquo; reads the rather chirpy the notification.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple was quick to get in on the action. To mark the day, the mega-brand turned some of its top executives into &lsquo;Memoji&rsquo; for the day. The 3D avatars each take on some of the personal features of the leaders. If you head to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/leadership/">official leadership page</a>, all the usual headshots have been replaced with the characters instead.</p>

<p>Many of the emoji have a dead likeness to the well-known Apple leaders. However, one or two of them have quite an intense look &ndash; an effect which was most likely unintentional. For example, Jony Ive&rsquo;s emoji has a stare that might make you shudder a little. Beware: You don&rsquo;t want to look this emoji directly in the eyes!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Jony Ive&rsquo;s Memoji can see into your soul <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldEmojiDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WorldEmojiDay</a> <a href="https://t.co/AFgjb5Gzdr">pic.twitter.com/AFgjb5Gzdr</a></p>

<p>The good people of Twitter have already been commenting on the emoji&rsquo;s blank stare and emotionless face. While some think that the character looks like he&rsquo;s had one too many coffees, others have suggested that he can &lsquo;see into your soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reimagining the executives as emojified characters isn&rsquo;t the only way that Apple has celebrated this oh-so-special day. The company has also <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/07/apple-celebrates-world-emoji-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that more than 70 new emoji will soon be available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch users. Additions to the line-up include a pleading face, a party face, a cold face and even superheroes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there are also new hair and skin colour variations out there including bald emoji, grey-haired emoji and (my personal favourite!) red-haired emoji. Finally, people with gloriously orange hair, like myself, will have an emoji to represent them! Hurrah.</p>
<p>Sadly, you&rsquo;re going to need to a little patience as these brand-new emoji are not available immediately. Apple state that they will come with a free update to iOS 12, which should come sometime later this year. Watch this space.</p>
