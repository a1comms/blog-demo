<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">He claims facial recognition lead to his false arrest.</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Facial recognition technology has come a long way in recent years. Now, many of us rely on this feature on a daily basis to unlock our devices, use mobile banking, and more. However, one teen claims that the tech lead to his false arrest last year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ousmane Bah, an 18-year-old from New York, has filed a lawsuit against Apple after he was falsely arrested. The teen believes that the company&rsquo;s facial recognition feature caused the police to arrest him for a crime that he did not commit. The incident happened back in November when Bah was arrested for theft in Apple Stores across the region.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The actual thief had stolen the teen&rsquo;s ID which didn&rsquo;t have a photo of him on it, according to the filing. It says that the perpetrator then used the card to create an Apple facial recognition account using his own face but the teen&rsquo;s identity. Bah claims that before the thefts he had lost his learner&rsquo;s permit, which was a non-photo document. He believes that this is the reason he was arrested by NYPD and linked to the crime spree.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that this claim has not gone to court yet and nothing has been proven. Plus, despite the recent filing, an official from Apple has told media outlets that the company does <em>not </em>use facial recognition in its stores.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thankfully, the teen&rsquo;s arrest did not last all that long. After looking over the footage of the thefts, the detective on the case determined that Bah and the actual thief looked nothing like one another. What&rsquo;s more, he was attending his senior prom in Manhattan while one of the thefts &ndash; which took place in Boston &ndash; was being carried out. That evidence was enough to clear his name. However, the teen is now filing a claim against Apple.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Within the claim, Bah says that he was made to respond to false allegations when he was arrested and that the ordeal lead to &lsquo;severe stress and hardship&rsquo; on his part. For that reason, he is seeking one billion dollars&rsquo; worth of compensation from the trillion-dollar company. It&rsquo;s quite a bizarre case. Of course, right now, t&rsquo;s not clear whether these claims will stand-up in court and what the outcome will be.</p>
