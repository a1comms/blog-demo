<p>As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. So, working on that logic, an emoji must be worth at least a sentence.</p>
<p>Yes, popping those little icons into messages and comments saves time and effort. Whether you want to show that you&rsquo;re being sarcastic, or you&rsquo;re simply overjoyed, there&rsquo;s an emoji for every emotion.</p>
<p>Easy. Fast. Effective.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the amount of emoji out there is ever-growing. Recently, in fact, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/apple-announces-amazing-new-emoji-for-iphone-on-ios-11-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple added 70 new emoji</a> to iOS 11.1, which means you can pretty much convey any thought, feeling, or judgement with just the tap of an icon. We may one day scrap words altogether at this rate.</p>

<p>Still, have you ever wondered what the most popular emoji is? Well, the results are in, and according to Apple, the most popular emoji for US English-speakers is&hellip; &nbsp;&#x1f602;!</p>
<p>While most of us call this face the &lsquo;laugh/cry&rsquo; emoji (if we refer to it at all&hellip;), its actual title is &lsquo;Face with Tears of Joy.&rsquo; You can see why it&rsquo;s so popular. It&rsquo;s ideal for almost any occasion. Whether you&rsquo;ve messed up so bad that you&rsquo;re laughing at your own blunder, or you&rsquo;re giggling at a hilarious meme, there&rsquo;s no end of ways in which you may wish to use it.</p>
<p>The reveal came in the form of Apple&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://images.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf">summary</a> of how it collects data, and uses it to analyse trends and so on. The stats also show that the two runners-up were the classic &lsquo;heart&rsquo; emoji and the &lsquo;crying loudly&rsquo; emoji. The takeaway being that the general population resort to love or tears in most situations.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the first time this particular emoji has been recognised for its popularity. Way back in 2015, Oxford Dictionaries actually named it as Word of the Year. It was a surprising move as it was the first time that a picture took the prestigious title.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>You may draw your own conclusions about what this says about society. We&rsquo;re all jokers, right? Or maybe we just can&rsquo;t take anything seriously. Or perhaps this is another sign that internet culture is taking over. The theories are as plentiful as they are weak. But, as there are no words to describe just how this news has made me feel, I&rsquo;ll leave you with this: &#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x1f602;</p>
