<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Pok&eacute;mon meets Street Fighter. This new mobile game is the result...</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. Summer 2016 was the season Pok&eacute;mon made an epic comeback. The world went insane for the new mobile game, Pok&eacute;mon Go.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t walk two minutes down the street without running into a wild fan, focusing intently on their phone while trying to flick Pok&eacute;balls at tiny augmented Pikachus.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the good people at Pok&eacute;mon Company International saw an opportunity here. If <em>one </em>Pok&eacute;mon game for mobile could rocket to such popularity, what was to say that another few couldn&rsquo;t do the same darn thing, eh?</p>
<p>Of course, a brand-new Pok&eacute;mon game is just what all of us need to start off summer 2017, so what&rsquo;s in store? Well, the latest game to be announced by the company is called Pok&eacute;Land. Right now, it&rsquo;s available for Japanese Android users to test in alpha (and will be available until 9th June).</p>

<p>So, what will the game be like and how will you play it? If you happen to have played any of the Pok&eacute;mon Rumble games on Nintendo devices, such as the Wii, the Wii U or the 3DS, you will recognise the style of this mobile game. It actually serves as something of a sequel to this series of games.</p>
<p>Unlike Pok&eacute;mon GO, this new game will mainly be about fighting your Pok&eacute;mon with one another, sort of like Street Fighter with tiny animated monsters. That&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s basically just a game where you take your beloved creatures to battle and let the other Pok&eacute;mon have it! Sounds like a dream, right?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you already have a Nintendo Account (because you&rsquo;re a pro gamer, obvs), you will be able to link it to the mobile app. That means that your Nintendo Mii will appear &lsquo;in game&rsquo; when you play Pok&eacute;Land on your smartphone. Genius.</p>
<p>Now that you know all there is to know about the game, you&rsquo;re probably wondering when you&rsquo;ll get to play it. Brace yourself. Sadly, right now, we don&rsquo;t have an official release date for Pok&eacute;Land. However, we <em>do </em>know that it will be available for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we suggest getting back on board with the whole Pok&eacute;mon GO shebang. Pok&eacute;mon Company International has recently released a whole load of Generation II monsters on the game, along with some other exciting new updates. So, why not go catch &lsquo;em all&hellip; again?</p>
