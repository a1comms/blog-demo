<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">For as long as phones have had cameras, a debate has raged online, with neither side prepared to give an inch.</span></p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re talking about camera phones vs. standalone cameras. It&rsquo;s the question of whether smartphones will eventually kill off bespoke cameras.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that it&rsquo;s getting easier to imagine a world where this could happen, thanks to some key advantages that phones have...</p>
<h2>1. Standalone cameras do one thing, phones do many</h2>
<p>So, say you had a standalone camera, and it takes great photos, yes? Of course it does, but what then? What else can you do with it, besides taking photos? Can you play Angry Birds on it? Or troll celebrities on Twitter?</p>
<p>The point is this: while there may be a difference in picture quality between a smartphone and a standalone camera, the smartphone isn&rsquo;t focused on just being good at one thing. It does a lot more, and a device that does everything is a far more appealing prospect than carrying an extra device that does one thing.</p>
<h2>2. Picture quality isn&rsquo;t that different</h2>
<p>Seriously, it&rsquo;s amazing how far the cameras on phones have come since those early days of the Sony Ericsson T610. Consider the newly-announced HTC 10, for example; it has a 12MP camera with OIS (optical image stabilisation), but what really makes it brilliant is the combination of a nice wide aperture, a brilliant lens, and a sensor with pixels that are bigger than usual.</p>
<p>And so, the difference in picture quality between your typical cameras and phones is surprisingly small, and as phones get better and better components (especially lenses), we firmly predict that difference will dwindle away to nothing.</p>
<h2>3. It&rsquo;s easier to share photos from a phone</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s another fact to consider, as well: modern phones are all connected to the internet. That means they&rsquo;re all connected to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and because of that, it&rsquo;s absurdly easy to share your photos (and we don&rsquo;t just mean with your family; we mean with the entire world).</p>
<p>To put into perspective just how much phones have changed the world of photography: Instagram possibly wouldn&rsquo;t have existed if not for the rise of smartphones. Think about that...</p>
<h2>4. Your smartphone&rsquo;s always by your side</h2>
<p>Can you imagine always carrying a standalone camera round with you, just on the off-chance that something interesting happens? Of course not.</p>
<p>Because of smartphones, you no longer need to carry around single-purpose gadgets. The smartphone does it all.</p>
<p>And so, we come to a conclusion: camera phones might not have completely supplanted the standalone camera (since professional SLR cameras are still light years ahead of most mobile phones), but for certain types of camera, the instant snapper if you will, the writing does indeed seem to be on the wall...</p>
