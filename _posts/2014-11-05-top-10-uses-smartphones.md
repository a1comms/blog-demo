<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new study has revealed the top 10 uses for smartphones, and the surprising part is that voice calls only make number 6 on the list. Would people use smartphones that were no longer actual phones? Four out of ten people said they might...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There was a time when people chose their mobile phone based on how effective it was at making a phone call. Back in the day, the ability to make a phone call was the chief feature, mainly because that&rsquo;s all they could do&hellip;</p>
<p>In 2014, though, the world has clearly changed. We have big, powerful superphones like the iPhone 6 or the Samsung Galaxy S5 knocking about, and they can do a <i>lot</i> more besides voice calls. In fact, according to a study by taxi app Hailo, voice calls don&rsquo;t even make the top five...</p>
<p>No, voice calls actually come in at number 6, with people taking, on average, 20 minutes to complete three voice calls. Sending and reading text messages take up the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> spot, with 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> falling to reading emails, surfing the net and setting an alarm, respectively.</p>
<p>At the tail end, sending emails, checking the time, using the calculator and having a snoop on Facebook followed in that order.</p>
<p>Even more unexpectedly, 4 out of 10 smartphone users believe they could handle not having a voice call function on their phones at all!</p>
<p>So, what does this tell us about the people using smartphones? Well in the words of Tom Barr, chief executive of Hailo, &ldquo;The functions on a smartphone have developed and improved drastically over the past decade. With so many ways to keep in touch nowadays, people are using the functions that are convenient for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we get less and less time to ourselves, we need more convenience in our lives and less hassle. While calling can be more personal, it doesn&rsquo;t always save you time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How do you use your smartphone? Do you mostly use it for things other than voice calls? Or is talking to people more important to you? We&rsquo;d love to know!</strong></p>
