<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">"Hey Siri, is this for real?"</span></p>
<p>Since his days in the ring, Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson has certainly come a long way. He&rsquo;s no longer a mere caricature of a fighter, touting cheesy lines to a riled-up audience. No, these days, he&rsquo;s a legit actor. In fact, last year, he actually became the world&rsquo;s highest paid actor, beating Jackie Chan to the punch.</p>
<p>Over the course of his movie career, the former wrestler has starred with many other Hollywood greats, including Aaron Paul and Zac Efron. So, his next &lsquo;co-star&rsquo; (and, believe me, I used that phrase lightly) should come as a real surprise. Here&rsquo;s a hint&hellip; It&rsquo;s not even human.</p>
<p>In your wildest dreams, I bet that you never thought you&rsquo;d see the day when Siri (yes, Apple&rsquo;s very own digital assistant) would become a breakout movie star. Well, that day is upon us, friends. The AI has landed its very first leading role in a production that Johnson is calling the &ldquo;biggest, coolest, sexiest, funnest movie ever&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a catch. Actually, the so-called &lsquo;movie&rsquo; is a three-minute and 45 second long video clip (watch below). I&rsquo;m certain that you will agree that calling a short clip <em>a film</em>, is a stretch. But we'll suspend our disbelief, won't we?</p>
<p>If Johnson <em>says </em>it&rsquo;s a film, I guess we have no choice but to believe him, right? It&rsquo;s called<em> The Rock x Siri: Dominate The Day </em>and is pretty much an action-packed extended advert for the tech company. If you&rsquo;re just a tad curious about the film, you&rsquo;re in luck. The movie is on Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_M8A5yxnLfW0KghEeajjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channel right now, and you can watch it right here too.</p>

<p>So, grab some popcorn, snuggle up, and prepare to be blown away by Siri&rsquo;s first big (or little) screen production. Oh, it&rsquo;s a wonderfully weird time to be alive.</p>
