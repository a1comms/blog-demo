<p><span class="postStandFirst">The LG G3 has now been officially unveiled, so it&rsquo;s time for us to take an in-depth look at what makes this phone so special, including a camera with laser-assisted focus, top-tier processing power that will let it compete against the likes of the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5, and a Quad-HD screen that&rsquo;s sharper than any other smartphone on the market!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4308" alt="14103666858_3eec717bdf" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14103666858_3eec717bdf.jpg" width="490" height="500" />Announced in front of an expectant crowd, the new LG G3 has finally been officially unveiled, confirming (or proving wrong, in some cases) months of rumours. Many people have been working themselves up to fever pitch for the LG G3, but why is that?</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Put simply, what is it that makes the LG G3 so exciting, and what chance will it have against incumbent superphones like the Samsung Galaxy S5?</p>
<p>Put the kettle on, put your feet up, and let&rsquo;s take a look at what makes the superphone so <em>incredibly super</em>...</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no getting away from the fact that the <em>big</em> thing everyone has been getting excited about, throughout the months of rumours around the LG G3, is its screen. Right from day one, the rumours talked about a 2K screen, with a resolution of 2560x1440 pixels. That&rsquo;s four times the resolution of a 720p screen (of the kind you&rsquo;d find on the Moto G), which gives this particular screen resolution its more well-known name of Quad-HD, often shortened to QHD.</p>
<p>Well the LG G3 does indeed have a QHD screen, making it look <em>unspeakably</em> sharp, even at the larger size of 5.5-inches.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the screen on the LG G3 is, quite simply, in a league of its own!</p>
<h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4303" alt="14288329932_85491ef62a" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14288329932_85491ef62a.jpg" width="373" height="450" />When you look at other superphones on the market, whether they&rsquo;re made by Samsung, HTC or Sony, they all have very similar, and equally powerful, internal specs. The same is true of the LG G3, as it comes with a Snapdragon 801 processor clocked to 2.5GHz, 2GB of RAM, and up to 32GB of onboard storage (expandable through a microSD slot, although alas, that slot will only take memory cards up to 128GB instead of the 2TB that had previously been rumoured; that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a dealbreaker, though, as 2TB cards are ridiculously hard to find, if they even exist at all, yet).</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice to see smartphone cameras that do something unique; whether it&rsquo;s the PureView imagine tech in the Nokia Lumia 1020 or the utterly mind-boggling, laws-of-nature-defying Duo Camera in the HTC One M8, we love it when a smartphone camera offers something different to all its rivals.</p>
<p>That might help to explain why we&rsquo;re so excited about the LG G3, since it has a <em>laser-assisted</em> autofocus. In short, the LG G3 uses an infra-red laser to help the camera focus a <em>lot</em> quicker, and while it sounds like a small thing, it certainly gets our seal of approval.</p>
<p>Plus, of course, it <em>sounds</em> cool...</p>
<h2>Other Bits &amp; Bobs</h2>
<p>Of course, there are a few other features that make the LG G3 rather intriguing (such as wireless charging, and that rather nice faux-metal finish), although for things like software features, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until we get our hands on one to see how brilliant they are. Sadly, one of the features we would have most liked to see (i.e. water-resistance, as in the Sony Xperia Z2) has not made it into the LG G3, but that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for what appears to be a truly fantastic superphone.</p>
<p><strong>And so, in conclusion, the gorgeous, new LG G3 looks like it may well be one of the greatest phones we&rsquo;ve ever seen, especially with that amazing Quad-HD screen. We can&rsquo;t wait to put this beauty through its paces! </strong></p>
