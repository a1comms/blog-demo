<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is this the future of smartphone security?</span></p>
<p>From mobile banking to your never-ending emails, your phone is the key to unlocking them all.</p>
<p>For most of us, everything that&rsquo;s essential to our modern existence is stored inside this little handheld gadget. So, with that in mind, the very last thing we want is anybody accessing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why phone security is such a hot topic these days &mdash;&nbsp;we all want our mobile phones to be impenetrable. Needless to say, Face ID is a real game-changer.</p>
<p>Of course, with the upcoming release of iPhone X, Apple is truly leading the way in security. But, it looks as though Android smartphones could be hot on its heels.</p>

<p>Since the announcement of Apple&rsquo;s revolutionary new security system, many have speculated on what Android manufacturers will do next.</p>
<p>Well, the leading phone manufacturers won&rsquo;t want to get left behind if facial recognition takes off. That is, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities, who recently noted that we may be seeing some face scanning tech from Android devices in the near future.</p>
<p>The belief is that facial recognition is the most secure way to lock and unlock a mobile phone, making iPhone X pretty much the safest smartphone right now (or when it launches, at least).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15192" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ioX84Oz4kcBgq4ohgeZzu7AxtPEPEFakvVOQcbEmwUnEueGDgiKRbz7r_uE8y3fHl98coLN35g-yFdOf4xVI2B0=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But facial recognition technology isn&rsquo;t just about security. It allows for a whole range of new features, including futuristic augmented reality functions and Animoji.</p>
<blockquote><p>"3D sensing not only enables facial recognition in security applications and allows users to create fun expressions like Apple's Animoji, on a more important level, it is a key factor in the development of AR," - Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities</p></blockquote>
<p>While it would be easy to assume that this spells the end for the likes of fingerprint sensors, that may not be the case&hellip;</p>
<p>According to Kuo, Samsung is currently developing a sensor that&rsquo;ll work <em>under</em> glass for the Galaxy Note 9, possibly launching next summer.</p>

<p>So, what does the future hold for mobile security? Well, if these predictions are correct, quite a lot actually. Yes, 2018 could see a whole host of brand new features on both Android and Apple smartphones. Watch this space!</p>
