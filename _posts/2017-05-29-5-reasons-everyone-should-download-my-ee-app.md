<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If you haven't yet downloaded My EE App, you'll want to after reading this.</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; If you&rsquo;re an EE customer, we&rsquo;ve got a top tip to let you in on. There&rsquo;s one app that you absolutely <em>must</em> download right now. You might have heard of it, it&rsquo;s called My EE App, and it&rsquo;s probably more important than any other app (if you&rsquo;re on EE).</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why you need My EE App in your life RIGHT NOW.</p>

<h2>1) Find Out Your Full Plan Details</h2>
<p>The truth of the matter is that many of us just don&rsquo;t pay attention when it comes to our plan details. Sure, you read over them when you sign up, but do you remember exactly what they actually are? Probably not.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13931" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LLEZqf3vT6MOQag8X1M8v1aZXREqMpU7RgwzADIeVZ1zLmtGPoOVEDTgm1b7k8bOu7IHTGtwFKR0DkA9-311h11Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Luckily, that&rsquo;s where My EE App comes into play. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded it and logged in, you&rsquo;ll see everything you need in mere seconds. That means that checking up how much your allowances are and seeing what you&rsquo;re getting for your cash has never been easier. Keeping on top of these little things gives you<em> way</em> more control than ever before, which is sure to be a major help.</p>
<h2>2) See&nbsp;Your Bill Date and Get More Control</h2>
<p>Staying on top of your personal finances can be a trial, especially when you&rsquo;re not sure how much you&rsquo;re being charged for various things. Well, luckily, you no longer have to deal with paper bills or even emails. Instead, you can see an itemised bill at the opening of an app.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13932" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i_BavJNNXlml7wrzLletPuptFZq9zpbLiSV-msf-RM0BXzKkJxW6kjth8ZmYxCjfRxzwTZ87jj8Uu4AV5h8sMJSX=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can also see when your bill date is, how much you owe, and how to pay it off - all at the tap of a button. If you&rsquo;re hoping to stay on top of all your mobile phone bills, My EE App is the best tool to help you along the way!</p>
<h2>3) Never Run Out of Data</h2>
<p>Urgh! It&rsquo;s so utterly annoying when you reach your data allowance limit, because you had no idea how much you had been using. You may be in the middle of watching a video on YouTube, or just scrolling through Facebook, and suddenly things start to slow down. Nightmare.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13933" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lIrh0fHg22Na_UWywT09ibr4NAzP6VDntrFxhK4S48-U-UAEyIkOhQvyCewqnJX5kTgrbBhxxfib-TOozwekVh6T=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>With My EE App, you can make sure you never run out of data again. Simply by looking at the app, you can find out how much data you have, how much you&rsquo;ve used, and how long you need it to last until refreshes.</p>
<h2>4) Save Money on Your Bill</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, none of us like it when we get hit with a massive bill at the end of the month. The best way to avoid any unexpected charges is to make sure that you know what costs and what doesn&rsquo;t. That way, you can stay on top of everything ahead of time. When your bill seems a tad more pricey than it ought to be, My EE App can help.</p>

<p>The app actually allows you to track your spending as you go. Any time during the month, you can login to the app to check out how much your current bill will be. That means that you can also see when you&rsquo;ve gone over your tariff and curb your usage ahead of time.&nbsp;Calls abroad and MMS messages are two examples of what could be costing you.</p>
<h2>5) Get Extra Data or Calls if You Need Them</h2>
<p>Of course, if it looks as though you&rsquo;re about to run out of minutes or data, and you&rsquo;ve still got a while to go, the last thing you want to do is wait for your allowance to renew. Instead, you can nab some extras for a small fee through the app, including packages for travelling abroad. That means that you will know <em>just </em>how much you&rsquo;ll need to pay and how much data or calls you will get.</p>
