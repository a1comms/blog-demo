<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">iOS 10 for iPhones and iPads can be yours today.</span></p>
<p>iOS 10 &ndash; announced during WWDC on the Monday just gone &ndash; is going to take your iPhone to a new level of obsession. Well it will for me at least.</p>
<p>In no accident, Apple announced 10 fresh features coming to iPhones on iOS 10, bringing a range of wonderful new ways to play, including more expressive Messages and a completely redesigned lockscreen. <em>Read more about both and more below</em>.</p>
<p>The all-important question, though, is when the hell can you get iOS 10? For most people, the answer is sometime in autumn. But for you, reading this, the answer is today. How? Find out below.</p>
<p>But before we tell you how to get iOS, here&rsquo;s a recap of five of our favourite new features.</p>
<h2>The hottest iOS 10 features</h2>
<p><strong>1) Raise to wake</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using an iPhone 6s, you&rsquo;ve no doubt experienced the aggro that comes with a super-fast fingerprint reader &ndash; you just fly right past your notifications, before you get a chance to read them.</p>
<p>iOS 10 will fix that by introducing the ability to raise your iPhone to wake the screen. It&rsquo;s kind of like the flip-to-see motion on Apple Watch, or similar technology on Nexus 5X.</p>
<p><strong>2) Rich lockscreen notifications</strong></p>
<p>Apple has performed a complete overhaul of the lockscreen, opening up a much wider set of interactions and a new design. Segmented into bubbles now, you can use 3D tough to expand notifications and take action, like accepting calendar invites and responding to messages.</p>

<p><strong>3) Improved Apple Music</strong></p>
<p>Sure, Apple Music might seem a success considering its 15 million strong user base, acquired in less than 12 months of launching. But it&rsquo;s been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism, specifically around usability issues and early bugs that deleted music libraries.</p>
<p>Apple is working on making it much cleaner and easier to navigate, with better suggestions and new additions like lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>4) More advanced Siri</strong></p>
<p>On iOS 10, you&rsquo;ll be able to ask Siri more questions in more varied ways. And with it opening up to third-party apps, services like Uber and WhatsApp will be under your command.</p>

<p><strong>5) Way more expressive Messages</strong></p>
<p>The Messages app is opening up a whole new world of ways to talk to friends. Any word you type that can be replaced with an emoji &ndash; which are now three times bigger &ndash; will automatically highlight itself, letting you tap to convert.</p>
<p>You can convey messages with more &lsquo;volume&rsquo; by increasing the text size and speech bubble, and, adversely, tone the message down with smaller text.</p>
<p>One of the coolest new features is &ldquo;Invisible Ink&rdquo;, which lets you mask photos with a blurry, out-of-focus effect, which the receiver can unveil with a slide of their finger. We wonder how responsibly that will get used&hellip;</p>

<h2>How to get iOS 10 today</h2>
<p>They say good things come to those who wait, but wouldn&rsquo;t you rather just have iOS 10 right now?</p>
<p>In its current iteration, iOS 10 is pre-beta, which means Apple is still in a relatively early stage of development. So, as with any software that&rsquo;s not yet for public release, there are likely still various bugs and teething problems to find and fix.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t have iOS today. The Developer Preview is already available for download &ndash; though, the catch is, you are required to join Apple&rsquo;s Developer Program, which will cost the princely sum of $100 (roughly &pound;69).</p>
<p>If, like me, you keep a tight rein on your purse strings, and you&rsquo;d rather your iPhone wasn&rsquo;t crashing every time you used it, then you can wait for the free public beta that&rsquo;s due to go live in July.</p>
<h2>When is the official iOS 10 release date?</h2>
<p>Frustratingly typical of Apple, there&rsquo;s not yet an official release data for iOS 10, though it&rsquo;s been promised to us for autumn. You can bet it will coincide with the announcement / launch of the rumoured iPhone 7, which we&rsquo;d guess is set for an unveiling mid-to-late September.</p>
