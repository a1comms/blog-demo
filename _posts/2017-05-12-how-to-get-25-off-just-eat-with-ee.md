<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Your weekend just got a whole lot tastier!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re partial to a Saturday night takeaway (who isn&rsquo;t?), we might have just the thing for you. Right now, EE and Just Eat have teamed up to offer customers a neat little discount on their next order. Yes, if you happen to be on EE, you can get 25% off your next takeaway meal. As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, getting and using the code could not be easier.</p>
<h2>How to Get a Just Eat Discount Code</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to order yourself some rather tasty Just Eat treats, you should make sure that you have the code ahead of time. All you do is text &lsquo;Eat&rsquo; to 141. You should find that you get a quick text back with the full discount code on it. Once you have it, you have 14 days to use it!</p>
<h2>How to Use a Just Eat Discount Code</h2>
<p>Now, here comes the fun bit: It&rsquo;s time to order yourself a cheeky takeaway with a whopping 25% discount off the bill, courtesy of EE. What could be better than that? If you already have your code, ordering the food is simple. Just follow these instructions to grab your feast:</p>
<h2>1) Download the Just Eat App</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have the Just Eat app, download it before you go any further. You can get it for free in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justeat.app.uk&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/just-eat-takeaway-food-delivery/id566347057?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and it should take mere seconds to download.</p>

<h2>2) Choose a Restaurant or Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t used the Just Eat app before now, you&rsquo;ll need to type in your post code to see what eateries are available in your area. Scroll through the list until you find your favourite one.</p>
<h2>3) Choose Your Dish</h2>
<p>Here's the hardest part... picking what you actually want to eat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13827" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FTTBMFsaTldKrQ5U2TsBNZctmE0PNfQ0HNm_jzu_57Gtgf9MAhVusaDr8S1q9Ja-U-4bPcWoEFc4hhIwL_SVrrmXHw=s0" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>Once, you've decided, and you&rsquo;ve nabbed all the spring rolls you can handle, it&rsquo;s time to head to the checkout to pay!</p>
<h2>4) Use the Right Payment Type</h2>
<p>This part is super important. To redeem the discount, you need to pay by card. (You can&rsquo;t use this offer when paying by Apple Pay or even by cash.) Select pay by card and enter your debit or credit card details.</p>
<h2>5) Enter the Voucher Code</h2>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve entered your card details, look for the &lsquo;I have a discount code&rsquo; button. Click that and you can enter your voucher code right away. (Be aware that the codes are case sensitive and that you will need to include the hyphen too.)</p>
<h2>6) Finally, Stick the Telly on and Enjoy Your Takeaway!</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve done all the above, you&rsquo;ll get a rather tasty 25% discount on your Just Eat order. All that&rsquo;s left to do is stick some plates in the oven, get the TV on and wait!</p>

<p><strong>This offer will be available to EE customers until 31 May 2017. So, what on earth are you waiting for? It&rsquo;s time for a weekend feast! </strong></p>
