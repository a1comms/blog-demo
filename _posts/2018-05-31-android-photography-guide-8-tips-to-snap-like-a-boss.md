<p>Whether you&rsquo;re taking foodie pictures to show the world on Instagram, or just grabbing some holiday snaps for Facebook, photography is a real art form.</p>
<p>While the world of smartphone cameras has come a seriously long way, there are still ways you can improve your pictures by learning some simple tricks. Here are eight more that you should try!</p>
<h2>1) Clean Your Camera Lens</h2>
<p>Perhaps this tip should go without saying, but it&rsquo;s something that you should keep in mind. You need to clean your camera lens regularly. This is particularly important if you happen to be using a <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>Why? Well, the fingerprint sensor on the rear of the Galaxy S9 is pretty close to the camera lens, which could mean you occasionally run your finger across it. Be sure to use a sheer cloth to clean the lens from time to time to get quality photos!</p>

<h2>2) Steer Clear of Digital Zoom</h2>
<p>Sure, your mobile phone probably features a digital zoom function, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to use it. In fact, in many cases, it&rsquo;s better if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a digital zoom doesn&rsquo;t work the same way as an optical zoom. It merely enlarges the image, which immediately starts to compromise the quality of your picture. It&rsquo;s <em>not </em>a great look.</p>
<p>However, you could buy a mobile phone like <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei P20 Pro</a>, which features an optical zoom that allows you to get closer to your subject and maintain top quality.</p>

<h2>3) Make Sure the Lighting is Behind You</h2>
<p>It hardly takes a genius to understand that lighting is a crucial part of photography. Many people get thrown by this problem, but there&rsquo;s a simple way that you can get it right.</p>
<p>Make sure that the primary lighting source &ndash; i.e. a house light or the sun &ndash;&nbsp;is behind you when taking the picture. That way, you avoid a nasty glare and get a well-lit image. Nice.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling in a low-light situation, you can rely on mobiles like Samsung Galaxy S9 which features a large aperture that lets in more light and makes the most of dark conditions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16754" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qfeMVc7X7Lpat-EOS4oVqHrYTy54r_nTEAxXv-jJdbrO4Q_txfIzuTLwsHuMMm_6PN5jsB6Io8azJdVMuxpHmmI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>4) Tap to Focus on Your Subject</h2>
<p>If you happen to own a Samsung Galaxy S9, here&rsquo;s a trick that you need to know. It usually shoots with an f/1.5 aperture, which means that it captures great imagery in low-light conditions. However, you might find that you lose some quality in this mode.</p>
<p>To make sure that the subject of your photo &ndash; a person, plant, or plate of food &ndash;&nbsp;is in focus, you just need to tap the screen. Before shooting, highlight the image focal point by tapping it and watch the camera work its sheer magic.</p>

<h2>5) Try Out Some Editing Apps</h2>
<p>What apps do you use to edit your photos? Of course, there&rsquo;s the Android&rsquo;s Photo app and the many features available there, but you might want to look further afield.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magicv.airbrush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirBrush app</a> will help you take your selfie game to an entirely new level, while <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhqsolutions.enjoyphoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo Effects Pro</a> allows you to add some quirky finishes to your images. Take the time to experiment a little and see what&rsquo;s out there. You might be surprised.</p>

<h2>6) Try Out Different Camera Modes</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using the Android Camera app, there&rsquo;s something that you might not have noticed before now. The standard version of the app allows you to use a few different modes when it comes to shooting pictures. That could be a huge help if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to take more professional photos in no time at all.</p>
<p>The High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, for instance, is supposed to take pictures that most closely resemble what the human eye sees. Should you want to take a &lsquo;real&rsquo; or &lsquo;gritty&rsquo; photo, you might just have found out how. Some phones also offer the RAW mode, which means that the pictures are extremely high-quality and you have more editing options.</p>
<h2>7)Use Samsung&rsquo;s &lsquo;Food Mode&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Like it or lump it, we&rsquo;re a generation that takes pictures of our food. If you&rsquo;re the type of person that lets your phone camera tuck in to a meal before you take a bite, you&rsquo;ll love Samsung&rsquo;s latest feature: the Galaxy S9 comes with &lsquo;Food Mode&rsquo; to help you take some scrumptious photos of whatever meal you&rsquo;re about to eat.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imiuQXw2TbI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Food Mode is easy to engage; just swipe right when you&rsquo;re using the camera app, then start snapping away. The mode chooses a focal point &ndash; your plate and food &ndash;&nbsp;and then blurs around it for a dramatic and cool effect. It&rsquo;s time to take Instagram by storm!</p>
<h2>8) Use Both Hands to Snap!</h2>
<p>Still taking pictures with just one hand? That could be the reason that many of your photos end up blurry or unusable. To get the best possible pictures, you need to keep your phone as still as possible during shooting.</p>
<p>An easy way to do this is to make sure that you use both hands to take each picture. If you want to be <em>really </em>snazzy about it, though, you could get yourself a smartphone tripod and start snapping awesome pictures like a pro. You know it makes sense.</p>
