<p><span class="postStandFirst">Meet the controversial app that claims to reveal who has unfriended you on Facebook.</span></p>
<p>Called Who Deleted Me on Facebook, the app creates a log of your existing Facebook friends, and notifies you when, or if, they give you the digital middle finger by &lsquo;unfriending&rsquo; you.</p>
<p>Sadly, the app isn&rsquo;t capable of exposing any old &lsquo;friends&rsquo; who&rsquo;ve deleted you in the past. Just those from the moment the app is downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping your friends list in check, Who Deleted Me on Facebook shows which of your so-called buddies are currently blocked, and provides a &lsquo;last seen&rsquo; earmark for each individual.</p>
<p>Available for iOS, Android and as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/who-deleted-me/eiepnnbjenknnjgabbodaihlnkkpkgll?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a>, the app is making a bit of a comeback after being disabled in April by Facebook&nbsp;for &ldquo;circumventing their intended limitations,&rdquo; according to <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/07/06/app-unfriended-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mashable</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version boasts some improved features such as more frequent updates. Though judging by the user reviews in both the App Store and Google Play, there are some troublesome bugs that are compromising usability.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&rsquo;s some sort of blessing in disguise. Do you <em>really</em> want to know who&rsquo;s deleted you on Facebook? And what would you do if you did find out? Condemn them in a status they can&rsquo;t see?</p>
<p>Inevitably some <em>will</em> want to bypass the current issues Who Deleted Me on Facebook looks to be experiencing. So for those guys, there are alternative ways of uncovering the ugly truth&hellip;</p>
<p>Such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloading your Facebook &lsquo;info&rsquo;</a>, which will pull all of your data together into &lsquo;.htm&rsquo; files. You can then <a href="http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bioc/tools/compare.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compare</a> this data to fresher data at a later date (pause and untwist tongue), to determine whether your friend count is depleting.</p>
<p><strong>This is more or less what the app does each time you update it, in a roundabout way.</strong></p>
