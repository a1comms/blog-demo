<h2>Slope Phone Safety</h2>
<p><em>Breaking your mobile phone on the slopes</em>, a most chilling thought when concerning your most loved pocket companion. Well fear not mobile fans, here are some ideas to keep your phone safe.</p>
<p><strong>1) Get Mobile Phone Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Well it goes without saying, make sure you have insurance for your smartphone. There are so many things that could go wrong, and when you&rsquo;re in a different country, it will certainly ruin your day, if not the entire holiday.</p>
<p>Grab some not so bitterly priced mobile phone insurance right here, via our sister company, <a href="https://www.insuremypocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insure My Pocket</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2) Keep Your Phone Warm and Dry</strong></p>
<p>Well, as warm and dry as you can in the mountains. You can pick up a clear zip lock waterproof bag pretty cheap these days. The bags are great for keeping your phone dry and usable, as you can easily access it to take photos galore without taking it out the bag.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16223" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VqmZ74PrTENHwspl442lHdGq-6elpKAw9ZuHp5bZC5tqEaOMijD_SpVI3GrQyTYvBBAHHQdMH643K58MO-rADQw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Although mobile phones are stringently tested in harsh environments, sometimes your phone might decide it doesn&rsquo;t like the cold. As you&rsquo;ve already got loads of layers on, keep your mobile easily accessible on the layer beneath your coat. It will benefit from the extra body heat.</p>
<p><strong>3) Keep Your Phone Away from Your Ski Pass</strong></p>
<p>If you can help it, keep your ski pass away from your smartphone. There's always the potential they may interfere with one another and effect whether your pass decides to work or not.&nbsp;After all, it would be a bit awkward if you hold up the queue for the lifts,&nbsp;so better safe than sorry.</p>
<h2>Roam Like You Mean It</h2>
