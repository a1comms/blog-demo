<p>I bet you&rsquo;ve always wanted to use your phone in the shower? Well, now you can.</p>
<p>Someone out there has come up with this genius idea. Whoever it is, give that guy a cookie, because this is cool.</p>
<p>If, like us, you&rsquo;re addicted to your phone, you might even take it in the bathroom with you. Whether on the throne, or jumping in the tub, your phone isn&rsquo;t too far away, right.</p>
<p>What if you could keep the smartphone party going, even when you&rsquo;re in the shower?</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dX_0kuIerBI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This new smartphone and tablet shower curtain has multiple pockets where you can position your device depending on your height. But wait, it gets better, you can even go portrait or landscape. This is almost too much to resist buying one.</p>
<p>Use your phone through the shower curtain to skip to the next song or reply to that WhatsApp message. Even take a cheeky selfie (not that we'd encourage this of course).</p>
<p>You could even ask Google those desperately pressing questions, send an important email, or check out that Facebook notification! The possibilities are, frankly, endless!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17454" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDyilruB5mYTKxIww5Df6Q9Vnz-lGb_Xr45dVN9flIX1jkyo7KksWEZRX3BrCQKn4nuXsIKKTZOnU9gJG18G25U=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>What? No risk of water damage. Hurrah! As you would expect, you&rsquo;re pretty much covered when it comes to the risk of water (unless you feel the need to launch water over the curtain, then there&rsquo;s a chance your smartphone could get a little wet).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it made of? The clear looking material is in fact, clear plastic, the highest quality EVA material that&rsquo;s extra thick and even mould free, according to one Amazon listing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about how it will look, one particular seller suggests styling this curtain under a fancier shower curtain, to protect your modesty of course. Not everyone will fancy a see through shower curtain.</p>
<p>The curtain pockets should be large enough to house all the latest tablet tech and smartphones, including&nbsp;iPhone X, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S9</a> and even iPad 2018. Best to check out the particulars of wherever you decide to buy from.</p>

<p>So, whether it&rsquo;s music, movies or games, this smart shower curtain has you covered.</p>
<p>Sadly, we don&rsquo;t stock the amazing shower curtain, but it is available to buy from retailers on Amazon.</p>
