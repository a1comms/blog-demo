<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">IFA 2015 looks set to deliver a batch of warm and gooey mobile goodness.</span></p>
<p>In the mobile world, we tend to set our watches using the big tech shows throughout the year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Mobile World Congress back in March, and then as we roll on into autumn, we have Europe&rsquo;s huge tech show&hellip; IFA.</p>
<p>With that time fast approaching, now is the moment to review the rumours and attempt to figure out what we might see in Berlin from 4<sup>th</sup> September...</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>We start with Taiwanese manufacturer HTC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some disagreement whether HTC will be unveiling the fabled HTC O2 (the successor to HTC One M9) and HTC A9 at IFA 2015, or later in October at a special HTC event.</p>
<p>Regardless of when they turn up, we may very well be in for a treat...</p>
<p>Starting with HTC O2, it&rsquo;s said to be a 6-inch Quad-HD phablet, with a next-gen Snapdragon 820 processor, a whopping great 4GB of RAM, a 20.7MP camera and IP certification.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. All that power, a massive screen, an epic camera, <em>and</em> it&rsquo;s rumoured to be waterproof.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_7828" align="aligncenter" width="960"]<img class="size-large wp-image-7828" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/htc-one-m9-hero-bg-1024x640.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/htc-one-m9-hero-bg.jpg alt=&rdquo;HTC One M9 is expected to be succeeded by HTC O2&rdquo;/>" width="960" height="600" data-id="7828" /> Can HTC out-design its stunning HTC One M9?[/caption]</p>
<p>And then, there&rsquo;s the other unconfirmed device, HTC A9 (or HTC Aero, depending on who you ask). Photos of this have leaked, causing some to compare to iPhone 6.</p>
<p>Specs are thin on the ground, but what&rsquo;s really interesting is the rumour that it will use a MediaTek processor. Specifically, it&rsquo;s said that it will use a processor with <em>TEN </em>cores... it&rsquo;s going to be a monster!</p>
<p>Aside from potential phones, expect to see HTC&rsquo;s VR headset (the Vive, co-created with much-loved game company Valve) on display.</p>
<h2>Sony</h2>
<p>Despite Sony Xperia Z3+ launching just a few months ago, the rumour mill is predicting that Sony Xperia Z5 will show its face in just a week or two, at IFA 2015.</p>
<p><em>If you&rsquo;re curious as to why the name suddenly skipped over the number &lsquo;4&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s because the Sony Xperia Z4 launched in other markets outside the UK.</em></p>
<p>Intriguingly, the speculation is suggesting there won&rsquo;t just be <em>one </em>Xperia Z5. Instead, we could be looking at three different variants, with increasing levels of awesomeness.</p>
<p>First up is Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, which is said to have a 4.6-inch 720p screen. Then there&rsquo;s Xperia Z5 itself, which is said to have a 5-inch 1080p screen.</p>
<p>Both of those versions will come with a fingerprint scanner and a massively upgraded 23MP camera, according to the leak, as will the third variant.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb">

<p>&mdash; Sony Xperia GB (@sonyxperiagb) August 24, 2015</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s this third one, the rumoured Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, that really caught our attention, because it&rsquo;s said to house a <em>4K Ultra-HD</em> screen (5.5-inches), giving it a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, LG G4 has a 2K Quad-HD screen at the same size; its resolution is 2560 x 1440 pixels, so when we compare pixel densities (a measure of the actual sharpness), the LG comes in at 538 pixels ppi, while the Sony manages a colossal 808 ppi.</p>
<p>Oh, and all three will likely be waterproof. Factor all that in, and we reckon Sony is the company to watch at IFA 2015.</p>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>Things are sure to heat up once Microsoft takes to the stage at IFA 2015, chiefly because of Windows 10.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no confirmation that Microsoft will actually announce any new phones at IFA, but the company does have a big press conference scheduled, and the whole world is waiting to see Windows 10 for mobile in action.</p>
<p>We <em>might</em> see the next iteration of the flagship Lumia range on display (said to be the Lumia 940 and the Lumia 940 XL).</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_7840" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="size-full wp-image-7840" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/20764083780_bd42083bcd_c.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/20764083780_bd42083bcd_c.jpg alt=&rdquo;Nokia Lumia 930 was Microsoft&rsquo;s last flagship device&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="400" data-id="7840" /> Nokia Lumia 930 was Microsoft&rsquo;s last flagship device[/caption]</p>
<p>Or Microsoft might wait till the end of the month, when the tech giant is rumoured to be having its own event. In either case, what of those two phones?</p>
<p>With Lumia 940, we&rsquo;re rumoured to be seeing a phone with a 5.2-inch Quad-HD screen, powered by a six-core Snapdragon 808 processor and 3GB of RAM. It&rsquo;s also said to have a 20MP PureView camera, so expect this baby to be a camera phone <em>par excellence</em>.</p>
<p>For the Lumia 940 XL, expect <em>that</em>, but bigger. More specifically, expect it to come with a 5.7-inch Quad-HD screen, an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and allegedly, a stylus like the Samsung Galaxy Note 5.</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>Interesting fact: Samsung usually uses IFA to launch the next iteration of its Note range of phablets.</p>
<p>Second interesting fact: that ain&rsquo;t happening this year, because the Korean giant has already announced Samsung Galaxy Note 5, and confirmed that it won&rsquo;t be coming to Europe. Sad face.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_7835" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="size-full wp-image-7835" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/gnb_banner_products_galaxy-note-5.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/gnb_banner_products_galaxy-note-5.jpg alt=&rdquo;Currently, Samsung has no plans to release the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 in Europe&rdquo;/>" width="640" height="467" data-id="7835" /> Currently, Samsung has no plans to release the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 in Europe[/caption]</p>
<p>Of course, we might see other phones on display in Berlin; Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus is coming to Europe, so we&rsquo;d bet <em>it</em> will be there, and it&rsquo;s always possible Samsung will announce something we&rsquo;re not expecting.</p>
<p>Like bringing the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 to Europe after all, because you&rsquo;ll sell a squillion of them if you do.</p>
<p>Just sayin&rsquo;, Samsung. Just sayin&rsquo;...</p>
<h2>LG</h2>
<p>LG is rumoured to be launching the LG G4 Pro at IFA 2015.</p>
<p>Speculation has been floating around about this new phablet, and if they pan out as expected, what we&rsquo;ll be seeing is a straight-up nemesis to Samsung Galaxy Note 5, with a 6-inch screen, a premium metal body, and best of all, a stylus!</p>
<p>Other than that, expect to see some new TVs, and the G Pad II tablet.</p>
<h2>Motorola</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re not expecting to see a great deal from Motorola in terms of actual <em>phones</em> (since they already had a big launch event a little while back), but we might see a new smartwatch, the Moto 360 2.</p>
<p>The original Moto 360 is still one of the best-looking smartwatches on the market, so we&rsquo;re intrigued to see if the new model will beef up the processor speed to make it as brainy as it is beautiful.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_7842" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-7842 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Motorola-Moto-360.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/mobile_main_BG1.jpg alt=&rdquo;Motorola Moto 360 is certainly one of the finer smartwatches on the market&rdquo;/>" width="640" height="599" data-id="7842" /> Motorola Moto 360 is certainly one of the finer smartwatches on the market[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>At the moment, all we have is rumour and supposition, but one thing&rsquo;s for sure: IFA 2015 is going to be an interesting watch! Stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
