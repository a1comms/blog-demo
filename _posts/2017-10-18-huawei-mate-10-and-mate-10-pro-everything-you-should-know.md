<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Can Huawei really take on Samsung and Apple?</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new mobile phone, it may be worth checking out what Huawei has in store this autumn.</p>
<p>The developers behind the Chinese megabrand have been hard at work and are all set to release two brand new flagship phones.</p>
<p>So, what can you expect from Huawei Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Pro?</p>
<h2>Mate 10 Design</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the Huawei devices have really upped their game.</p>
<p>The manufacturers have completely overhauled the style of the Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Plus. The robust tempered glass mimics that of an iPhone and looks rather snazzy, to say the least.</p>
<p>The minimal style design of both handsets is likely to woo modern-day tech lovers. It&rsquo;s so chic and classic that it&rsquo;s bound to attract people.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk colour. There is a little difference here. Huawei Mate 10 will be available in the beautiful sounding Mocha Brown, Black, Champagne Gold, and Pink Gold. That should be enough to keep the fashion-conscious happy. On the other hand, the Pro version will offer Midnight Blue, Titanium Grey, Mocha Brown, and Pink Gold too.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, Huawei has (unsurprisingly!) opted for an almost bezeless look, which is most popular these days. That means more screen for your money. Up against the present-day flagship devices, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t look out of place.</p>
<h2>Mate 10 Display</h2>
<p>Needless to say, both Huawei Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Pro are all about the screen, and that can only be a good thing. There&rsquo;s no home button on the Mate 10 Pro either, which means that the front of the device is literally just one big, beautiful display.</p>
<p>Like the Mate 9, the Mate 10 device has a 16:9 LCD display on a 5.9-inch screen. It&rsquo;s big enough to satisfy most users and should have a decent quality picture to boot. In terms of pixels, you get a nice 2560 x 1440 on this one, which can&rsquo;t be sniffed at.</p>

<p>Since the Mate 10 Pro lacks the bezel at the top of the screen and the home button, the display is somewhat larger. That makes it a serious contender in the bezeless awards. What&rsquo;s more, it packs a 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution. To be clear, both devices have HDR10, too, and really do excel in this area.</p>
<h2>Mate 10 Camera</h2>
<p>With both Huawei Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Pro, you get the same camera setup. And what that is, is a snazzy Dual Leica camera, consisting of a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor and a 12-megapixel colour sensor.</p>
<p>The latter sensor is complete with an optically stabilised f/1.6 27mm equivalent lens, while the former uses the same lens, but doesn&rsquo;t have the stabilisation feature. All in all, you can expect some high-quality imagery when you start snapping away with either one of these phones.</p>

<p>Touted as Huawei&rsquo;s best ever camera system, you should find that the autofocus is super-fast, and there are a whole load of neat little features too. Both phones promise &lsquo;scene detection&rsquo; and dual image signal processors, which mean that you&rsquo;re able to take some of the most incredible photos in just the touch of a button. Easy!</p>
<h2>Mate 10 Performance</h2>
<p>But enough about all that, what about performance? Well, in terms of chipset, these new Huaweis are identical. Both pack the Kirin 970 chip with eight cores. However, there&rsquo;s a slight difference in RAM, with the Mate 10 coming in at 4GB, and the Mate 10 Pro coming in at a hefty 6GB. Both have dual-SIM capabilities too.</p>

<p>When it comes to battery power, the two smartphones boasts a durable 4,000mAh unit. It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that since the Mate 10 Pro has a larger screen (and therefore larger power thirst), it may run out of juice faster than the Mate 10. Still, it has to be said that there&rsquo;s more than enough power to run both phones right through the day.</p>
<h2>Mate 10 Release Date</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get a tad confusing. Right now, we know that Huawei Mate 10 will be available in Australia, China, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, and UAE later this month. However, there&rsquo;s no news on when or, indeed, if it will ever come to the UK. Still, we <em>do </em>know that the larger Huawei Mate 10 Pro will be available here in the UK by mid-November. Yes!</p>
