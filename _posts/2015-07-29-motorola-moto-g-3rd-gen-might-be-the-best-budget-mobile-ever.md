<p><span class="postStandFirst">Motorola has unveiled the new Moto G 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen, the budget smartphone that offers a more affordable alternative to the likes of the iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S6. With new cameras, a new processor and a new screen (all housed in a water-resistant body), this little beauty&nbsp;could be the best budget mobile ever.</span></p>

<p>Two years ago, Motorola redefined the budget smartphone with the outstanding Moto G. Never before had we see a budget phone that offered so much for such a low price, and in 2015, it&rsquo;s for us to bear witness to the next evolution of <em>the</em> budget phone.</p>
<p>Yes, the Motorola Moto G 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation has been unveiled, but this time, its mission is a little different.</p>
<p>Adrienne Hayes, Motorola&rsquo;s head of marketing, says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to bring as many of our high-end features from Moto X to the G as quickly as possible, but we&rsquo;ve also got Moto E stepping up to fill needs at the low end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, what new stuff can we find in the Moto G 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen?</p>
<p>First up, there&rsquo;s the new 720p screen, which now comes in at 5-inches. That extra screen real estate and those extra pixels are hugely appreciated, as is the bump in power, thanks to the new Snapdragon 410 processor.</p>
<p>The cameras have both been upgraded, too, with a 13MP on the back, and a 5MP selfie camera. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a microSD slot for you to up the storage on the phone; that&rsquo;s a feature that&rsquo;s making something of a comeback, and seeing its inclusion in the Moto G 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen is a very welcome thing indeed.</p>
<p>Oh, and top of all <em>that</em>, the Moto G is <em>also</em> water-resistant!</p>
<p>So, will the Moto G 2015 redefine the budget smartphone all over again? Time will tell, but with so many upgrades, and such a tiny price increase, we reckon it just might!</p>
