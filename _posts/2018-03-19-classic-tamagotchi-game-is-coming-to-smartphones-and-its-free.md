<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Just remember to feed your Tamagotchi this time.</span></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a trip down memory lane. Follow me back to the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was a much simpler time; a time before smartphones and tablets; a time when the only gadget anyone really wanted came in keyring form. Yes, my friends, I&rsquo;m talking about the era of the Tamagotchi.</p>
<p>If you either can&rsquo;t remember, or simply have no idea what we&rsquo;re talking about, Tamagotchi was a digital pet that lived on a tiny electronic device. If you owned a Tamagotchi, it was your job to look after the digital pet, feeding and bathing it, satisfying its endless demands.</p>
<p>Tamagotchi was basically training for adulthood, when we&rsquo;d one day assume responsibility for a cat, dog, or even a child. In truth, most of us were pretty terrible at looking after our Tamagotchi pets; I know that mine died more times than a I care to admit...</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s over 20 years since the first Tamagotchi launched in 1997, and to celebrate its anniversary last year, the geniuses behind the toy started working on a special edition of the gadget.</p>
<p>That's right. As of right now, you can download the official Tamagotchi app for iPhone and Android. Called My Tamagotchi Forever, watch the video below to check it out for yourself:</p>

<p>The My Tamagotchi Forever game takes place in Tamatown, and you can pick your own Tamagotchi just like you did when you were a kid.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the graphics have come a <em>seriously </em>long way since back then, the core idea remains the same: Care for your pet and pander to its every whim. Should it need food, feed it. Should it need the toilet, clean it up. Charming, right?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15795" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pIvQJ3pQGj2Vb_zKcs3it-mGrtvLz22F9qbAZS5KOEX8lsq2tP1fJh6f7wSCaWJcX83G1SGq9A6b5lnspn27cbxM=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As though that&rsquo;s not enough to keep you busy and entertained, you can also play a load of mini games, where you win coins. You can then use the coins to buy extras, such as outfits, food, and decorations. Let&rsquo;s be honest here &mdash;&nbsp;it all sounds terribly fun and addictive.</p>
<p>My Tamagotchi Forever is available for both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-tamagotchi-forever/id1267861706?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.bandainamcoent.mytamagotchiforever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, and totally free to download.</p>
