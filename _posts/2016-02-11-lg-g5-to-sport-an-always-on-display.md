<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">LG is well-known for its daring concepts, as we&rsquo;ve seen from its leather-clad LG G4 and curvaceous LG G Flex 2.</span></p>
<p>Judging by a GIF posted to the South Korean company&rsquo;s official Facebook page, we&rsquo;re about to see a new facet to LG&rsquo;s out-of-the-box creativity.</p>
<p>Teasingly executed, the GIF reveals a silhouetted LG G5 outlined against a black background, with a cluster of information presented on the screen, and the caption &lsquo;Always ON&rsquo; glowing beside it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8454" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/LG-G5-always-on-screen.gif" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/LG-G5-always-on-screen.gif alt=&rdquo;LG G5 always-on screen&rdquo;>" width="1500" height="1500" /></p>
<p>From that, I think we can safely say that the LG G5 will sport an always-on display, with titbits of information always available at a glance, including date, time and notification alerts.</p>
<p>Your initial reaction might be, &ldquo;Hang on a sec, won&rsquo;t that kill the battery life?&rdquo; No, actually, because according to the speculation, LG G5 will feature an OLED screen, rather than an LCD unit. This means it would save power if&nbsp;only certain parts of the display were&nbsp;used, as each pixel would light up individually.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is all we know about the upcoming LG G5. Apart from the day of announcement, pegged for 21<sup>st</sup> February &ndash; as revealed in an earlier GIF (LG is really getting GIFFY with it) on Facebook.</p>
