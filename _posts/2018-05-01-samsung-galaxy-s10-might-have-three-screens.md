<p>It&rsquo;s been a long road. The world now waits with bated breath for the release of the 10th phone in the Samsung Galaxy S series. Luckily, we&rsquo;re already hearing some juicy rumours about what this exciting new device could have in store for us. Here&rsquo;s one of the best&hellip;</p>
<p>The upcoming flagship phone, which has been quietly and unofficially nicknamed the Samsung Galaxy S10 (although Samsung Galaxy X is also being mentioned), could have three screens. Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>The news comes from a recent report published on the <a href="http://www.thebell.co.kr/free/Content/ArticleView.asp?key=201804170100033270002055">The Bell</a>. The word so far is that there will be three separate LED panels on the phone, two of which will join together to make one giant screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17341" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QZl43WNAECToxhUrj9vMkpiSPXFdnTUbBc85b3JhF8S6Jt5ekO-gUgIezGHaYKU8xp3_m5TidLERNus1IqUrvLhx=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you unfold the phone, two of the 3.5-inch LED panels will flatten out to be one large screen. That means that you can essentially use the device as a mini tablet. Nice. This feature will supposedly be known as &lsquo;tablet mode,&rsquo; which makes sense.</p>
<p>But wait, what about the mysterious third screen? Well, it might be quite handy indeed. The other LED screen could be used when the Galaxy S10 (or X) is in &lsquo;phone mode&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s folded up. Think of it kind of like a book &ndash; this screen will be the front cover and the tablet is inside.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s no official word from Samsung on the phone. That means that this could all be a rumour and nothing more. However, it&rsquo;s not the first time that we&rsquo;ve heard talk of Samsung doing something like this. In fact, this could have been on the cards as far back as 2011, when Samsung released a <a href="https://www.oled-info.com/samsung-shows-us-whats-possible-transparent-flexible-amoled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concept video</a> about it. Interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, if foldable phones are the future (and it looks like they could be), Apple is sure to want a slice of the pie too. Last year, the geniuses received a <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170336831.PGNR.&amp;OS=&amp;RS=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patent</a> for a bendable screen. That could mean that Apple has plans to create a similarly mind-blowing phone in the future&hellip;. Watch this space.</p>
