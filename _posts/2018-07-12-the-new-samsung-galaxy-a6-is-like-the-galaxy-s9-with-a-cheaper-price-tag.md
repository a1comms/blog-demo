<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Say hello to the Samsung Galaxy A6!</span></p>
<p>Want to bag yourself some of Samsung&rsquo;s latest features without forking out too much cash? You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. We&rsquo;ve got the details on a sweet new device that packs some of the same features as the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S9</a> but with a lower cost.</p>
<p>Recently, Samsung announced the latest phone to join its A-series &ndash; the Samsung Galaxy A6. The device will run the all-singing, all-dancing Android Oreo operating system as well as boasting some futuristic highlights such as face scanning. Nice.</p>
<h2>Screen and Display</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17976" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xZi1yeAvuQDuQQMjy0zjU7rvlMiShpPU3RNQ-0VgU14ZRVveCBSPOueHHQBx4N5yLc45EBZN6Jw_L_kay4-JtAVH=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Much like Samsung Galaxy S9, the device boasts 18.5:9 Super AMOLED display &ndash;&nbsp;although it&rsquo;s not <em>quite</em> as big or impressive as the flagship&rsquo;s one. The screen comes in at 5.6 inches with a 720 x 1480 resolution. For the cheaper cost, you can&rsquo;t really complain with quality as good as that.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17977" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uEUe_h0xgm0nJZIOXuFO6SIQb68qkNWv0AaLiARmKojr-w_56102G9QAIXla6MaDfD0Q6y36yhxqJn_cpp3sk6Fo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the camera isn&rsquo;t half bad either. There&rsquo;s a 16-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing camera, a 16-megapixel f/1.7 rear camera, and an LED flash. The camera is touted as performing extra well in low-light conditions. Plus, you can also augment your selfies using the neat AR stickers feature. Fun.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17974" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gbi8DoCxCTCUuM9B-AKvHTfsdLceBBNovFKurMOK64xPAQWdkQLohOrkIMu8HDCPkc6kQbwbfD4voXu0hbTT4Zkx=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Make no mistakes, when it comes to power and storage, the smartphone should give you what you need. It sports 3GB RAM along with 32GB storage. There&rsquo;s a microSD slot too, which means that you can quickly and easily upgrade your storage by up to a further 256GB, should you need to.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the device has some of the same features as the Galaxy S9, it obviously doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to the same flagship standard. However, you still get a load of top features that make for a fantastic smartphone experience, from long-lasting 3000 mAh battery, to an advanced 16-megapixel camera on both sides of the device.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a decent mid-range device that gives you a little more for your money, you won&rsquo;t go wrong here. The facial scanning, top-of-the-range operating system, and cool AR extras mean that Samsung Galaxy A6 an utterly modern (and affordable) phone.</p>
