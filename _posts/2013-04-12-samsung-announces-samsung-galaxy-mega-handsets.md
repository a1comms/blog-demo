<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has announced the arrival of the new Galaxy Mega range of handsets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5499 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy Mega" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/00_GT-I9200_Standard_Origin-1024x681.jpg" width="960" height="638" /></p>
<p>Due to hit the market around May, the Samsung Galaxy Mega handsets are aiming at the mid-range segment of the smartphone market, to sit under the flagship Note series, offering a user experience unlike any other.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Mega 6.3 inch is the bigger of the two devices and sports an enormous display of 720p resolution, it will be running a dual core processor clocked at 1.7Ghz and will come with 1.5GB RAM making the device nippy and allowing true multi-tasking through Samsung&rsquo;s Touchwiz and multi-window viewing. Although there is no S-Pen stylus onboard Samsung has included Air View which work by detecting your finger an inch from the screen and basically turning your finger into a stylus.</p>
<p>The main camera on the Galaxy Mega 6.3 is an 8 megapixel unit and Samsung has included a 1.9 megapixel front-facing unit to take care of video calls, self-portraits and the like. Naturally, Samsung will include an abundance of bells and whistles in the imaging department through the Touchwiz user interface.</p>
<p>Connectivity is taken care of with the inclusion of LTE allowing for 4G usage, NFC and one of the current smartphone trends an infra-red emitter which, in turn, will allow the device to act as a remote control.</p>
<p>The Samsung Mega 6.3 will launch with Android Jelly Bean 4.2 onboard, will contain 16GB of internal storage with expandable options via a microSD slot, and will come with a massive 3,200mAh battery.</p>
<p>The smaller of the two Galaxy Mega devices, the Mega 5.8 inch, will offer slightly less in the spec department. Designed to cater for a more budget offering the Mega 5.8 will have a lower resolution display and the chipset will be running at 1.4 GHz .</p>
<p>On the connection side of things Samsung has also removed LTE support, NFC and the IR emitter from the Mega 5.8, but even without those extras, it's still a great all rounder for a stellar smartphone experience.</p>
<p><strong>Both models are expected to launch in May.</strong></p>
