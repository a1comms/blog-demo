<p><span class="postStandFirst">This compact superphone has so much to offer...</span></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 10px;" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini White" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/samsung_galaxy_s3_mini_white_tmb.jpg" width="64" height="127" /></strong>The&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3&nbsp;is hailed as one of the most incredible phones ever made, by a great many people, and while that&rsquo;s an entirely subjective viewpoint, one indisputable, objective fact about the phone is that it&rsquo;s easily the most popular Android phone ever made. But what if the Galaxy S3 is too big for your pocket? What if you want a high-end smartphone, that&rsquo;s a smaller, or that crucially, doesn&rsquo;t cost as much as its peers?</p>
<p>Well, the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini&nbsp;has you covered!</p>
<p>Just by looking at the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, you can see instantly that it shares the exact same design aesthetic as its big brother, as well as the considerably larger&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note II; it shares the same sleek lines, and glossy finish of those two heavy hitters, and is, as such, a gorgeous looking phone. As well as that, the thin body means it&rsquo;s eminently pocketable, and the curved back of the phone makes it feel very comfortable in the hand.</p>
<p>The really exciting thing about the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, though, is the fact that although it&rsquo;s classed as a mid-range phone, this is a thoroughbred smartphone that, until surprisingly recently, would have been classed as a top-end device. The dual-core processor, running at 1GHz, is nice and fast, and the 4 inch AMOLED screen gives the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini a beautiful, high colour &lsquo;face&rsquo;, that will make using the phone a truly pleasing experience.</p>
<p>The experience of using the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini will also be enhanced considerably by the fact that, despite once again being classed as a mid-range phone, it comes with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, right out of the box. As such, this is one of the few mid-range phones that will give you access to Google&rsquo;s brilliant &lsquo;Google Now&rsquo; voice control/search system (Google&rsquo;s response to Apple&rsquo;s Siri, the voice control system seen on the iPhone 5), and the now famous &lsquo;Project Butter&rsquo;, Google&rsquo;s range of UI improvements designed to make the user experience as smooth and responsive as possible. That fact alone is enough to mean that, despite the phone technically being a mid-ranger, there&rsquo;s nothing mid-range about the experience of using the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini.</p>
<p>Put simply, if you buy the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, you&rsquo;ll be getting more bang for your buck than you ever thought possible!</p>
