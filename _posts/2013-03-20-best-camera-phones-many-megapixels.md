<p><span class="postStandFirst">We review camera phones to reveal whether more megapixels really does indicate a better experience.</span></p>
<p>When it comes to camera phones, there seems to be a fairly limited selection of &lsquo;megapixel brackets&rsquo; into which the vast majority of phones slot neatly.</p>
<p>Early camera phones were viewed as being top-end if they had 2 megapixel cameras. Then came 5 megapixels. After that, 8 megapixel camera phones dominated the market, and now, we&rsquo;re beginning to see 13 megapixel camera phones become the&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;top-end.</p>
<p>But which phones are the best, within each &lsquo;megapixel bracket&rsquo;, and are there any phones that resolutely refuse to slot into these brackets?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the best camera phones available...</p>
<h2>8 megapixels - the mass market superphone</h2>
<p>In quite a short space of time, 8 megapixel cameras became&nbsp;<em>de rigeur</em>&nbsp;on top-end smartphones, to the point where, if one were to look at the market right now, virtually every top-end smartphone available has a camera with this resolution. There&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple">iPhone 5</a>, there&rsquo;s the&nbsp;Blackberry Z10, there&rsquo;s the&nbsp;LG Nexus 4... the point is that 8 megapixels is pretty much the benchmark which modern smartphones have to hit, to be classed as being &lsquo;top-end&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of the phones in this bracket, there&rsquo;s very little doubt that the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3&nbsp;is one of the most popular, if not even&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;most popular. However, as controversial as it may sound (because every phone mentioned in the last two paragraphs is rather brilliant), the Blackberry Z10 is possibly the better option in terms of camera performance, as it also comes with that incredible TimeShift feature, which allows you to time-shift the faces of everyone in shot, to make sure they&rsquo;re all smiling.</p>
<p>As this feature is more like magic than technology, the Blackberry Z10 offers something that no other phone&rsquo;s camera can, and is therefore the coolest 8 megapixel camera phone on the market.</p>
<h2>13 megapixels - the new hotness</h2>
<p>For a&nbsp;time, the biggest camera seen on top-end smartphones was one that came in at 8 megapixels, but now, we&rsquo;re beginning to see new camera phones emerge, ones that smash through the 8 megapixel barrier. The most notable examples are the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia Z</a>, and the newly unveiled&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat about the bush; as good as the Sony Xperia Z is (and it truly&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;an amazing phone), Samsung has packed&nbsp;<em>so many</em>&nbsp;new features into the Galaxy S4&rsquo;s camera, such as the ability to remove random people or objects from the background of photos, that the best 13 megapixel phone on the market is a phone that won&rsquo;t go on sale until April.</p>
<h2>The wild card - the phone that said &lsquo;Forget You&rsquo; to the Megapixel War</h2>
<p>There is&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;phone that refuses to be slotted into these pigeonholes, however, and that phone is the&nbsp;HTC One. It famously only has a 4 megapixel camera, but (and it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>big</em>&nbsp;&lsquo;but&rsquo;) it&rsquo;s a new&nbsp;<em>kind</em>&nbsp;of 4 megapixel camera, one where the individual pixels are all roughly three times bigger than any&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;phone camera&rsquo;s sensor. So, the HTC One has a 4 megapixel camera, that captures as much light as a 12 megapixel camera, leading to incredible low-light performance.</p>
<p><strong>Naturally, HTC&rsquo;s move&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a gamble, but whether it pays off or not, one thing is for sure: with all this innovation going on, the people who&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;benefit are you, the consumers!</strong></p>
