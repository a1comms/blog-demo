<p>On Monday 15th April, Game of Thrones will return to TVs across the country for its last season. If you&rsquo;re on tenterhooks waiting to see how the epic show will close, pop that date in your diary. While the series will air on Sky Atlantic, you don&rsquo;t actually need to have a Sky TV subscription to watch it.</p>

<p>If you get or already have a Vodafone Red Entertainment plan, you can actually bag yourself a free NOW TV Entertainment Pass for a whole 24 months. The pass allows you to watch some of the best shows including the Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale, Big Little Lies, The Walking Dead and &ndash;&nbsp;of course &ndash;&nbsp;Game of Thrones. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about how to get started.</p>

<h2>How to Get Your Free Subscription</h2>

<p>If you choose the right pay monthly plan on Vodafone, you could be entitled to the free NOW TV Entertainment Pass. All you have to do is ensure that you <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/vodafone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="select the Vodafone Red Entertainment plan (opens in a new tab)">select the Vodafone Red Entertainment plan</a> when signing up for your new contract.</p>

<p>As soon as you&rsquo;ve bought your new plan, you will get a text from Vodafone asking you to pick your freebie subscription.<sup>*</sup> You can choose from Amazon Prime Video, Spotify Premium, a NOW TV Entertainment Pass or Sky Sports Mobile TV. (Of course, you should go ahead and choose the NOW TV Entertainment Pass option to watch Game of Thrones!)</p>

<p>You just need to follow the link to your chosen entertainment membership and set up your free subscription. Finally, you will need to download the NOW TV app on your smartphone to start watching your favourite shows pronto.</p>

<p><em>* If the text message doesn&rsquo;t come through, you can text <strong>Entertainment</strong> to <strong>97613 </strong>to prompt it. </em></p>

<h2>NOW TV Entertainment Pass Highlights</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Wondering what&rsquo;s included with your free NOW TV Entertainment Pass? The subscription means that you get 11 of the best Sky channels at the touch of a button. Yes, you can watch Sky Atlantic, Sky 1, Sky Witness, Sky Arts 1, Gold, MTV, Fox, Nat Geo Wild, SYFY and Comedy Central live. That means that you can watch Game of Thrones when it airs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a busy person, though, you might want to catch up on your TV instead. Luckily, the plan includes a range of catch-up episodes as well as more than 300 box sets from which to choose. So, if you haven&rsquo;t quite caught up on the last season of the show, you can go back and watch it now. What more could you want?</p>
