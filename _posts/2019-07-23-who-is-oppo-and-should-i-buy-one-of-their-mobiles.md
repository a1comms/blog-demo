<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what you should know about this Chinese megabrand!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What does the name Oppo mean to you? If you&rsquo;ve never heard of this up-and-coming brand before now, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. The Chinese megabrand is currently making some of the best (and most affordable!) smartphones on the market.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The brand was one of the &lsquo;official suppliers&rsquo; of Wimbledon 2019, with the sporting event&rsquo;s head photographer having worked with an Oppo phone to capture some of the action. As if that wasn&rsquo;t exciting enough, the company is also one of FC Barcelona&rsquo;s official Global Partners, a deal that will last for the next three football seasons at least.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the big deal when it comes to Oppo? Well, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Let&rsquo;s take a look at four of the manufacturers&rsquo; smartphones and why you might love them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Oppo Find X</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Boasting an absolutely stunning, no-bezel design, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/oppo/find-x-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Oppo Find X</a> is a killer device. The smartphone comes with a massive 93.8% screen-to-body ratio, which means that it&rsquo;s all about the display here. It has an uber glossy back and comes in either Bordeaux Red and Glacier Blue, depending on your preference.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thankfully, this isn&rsquo;t merely a good-looking phone. It&rsquo;s also a powerful one. On the inside, you&rsquo;ve got a whopping 8GB RAM, which should mean that it&rsquo;s a speedy device. Combine that with a 3730 mAh battery pack and the VOOC Fast Charge feature, and you&rsquo;re sure to be onto something of a winner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to the cameras, the phone doesn&rsquo;t drop in quality at all. On the rear, there&rsquo;s a 16MP and 20MP lens combo, which should mean that you get stunning photography. The selfie camera is a huge 25MP offering too. Want a selfie that will dominate Instagram? There are also beautification features here, such as facial slimming and teeth whitening.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Oppo Reno 5G</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The world of smartphones is changing. Modern-day devices have to be ready to offer the next generation of mobile internet.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re hoping to get your hands on a snazzy 5G-ready smartphone, you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/oppo/reno-5g-green" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Oppo Reno 5G</a> device, which is available for pre-order right now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSK5DJb3OQo","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The premium smartphone offers an &lsquo;uninterrupted screen experience&rsquo;, which basically means that there are hardly any bezels. There&rsquo;s a 93.1% screen-to-body ratio with a 6.6.-inch display too. The phone is available in Ocean Green with intricate gloss detailing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The camera game is seriously strong too. There&rsquo;s a natural AI beautification feature, which means that your selfies and portraits will always be on point. The triple lens setup includes a 13MP telephoto lens, an 8MP wide-angle len and a massive 48MP ultra-clear main camera lens. There&rsquo;s also image stabilisation and Ultra Night Mode 2.0.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting! The selfie camera, the front light and the rear flash are all held inside a rising structure that pops out of the phone. The movement happens in less than a second and is completely silent. Snazzy stuff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Oppo RX17 Neo</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Looking for a super affordable offering? You might just find it in the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/oppo/rx17-neo-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Oppo RX17 Neo</a>. The smartphone has a plastic coating, which actually has the appearance of glass. There&rsquo;s a 6.41-inch Super AMOLED screen along with a cute teardrop notch at the top.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":21088} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2019/07/oppo-rx17-neo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-21088"/></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite the low price tag, the phone does come with some rather high-end features. For example, there&rsquo;s the in-screen fingerprint scanner. The Oppo RX 17 Neo also has excellent stamina and an impressive 3600 mAh battery pack too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what about the camera setup? On the rear of the phone, there&rsquo;s a dual camera setup, offering a 16MP and 2MP phone combination. However, it&rsquo;s the selfie cam that is the star of the show here with a 25MP lens. You should get a load of detail when snapping away.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Oppo RX17 Pro</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Taking the next step up, there&rsquo;s the Oppo RX17 Pro. The smartphone has an almost bezeless design and is available in an Emerald Green and Radiant Mist casing. The front sports a 6.4-inch OLED screen with 1080 x 2340 resolution. Plus, on the rear, there&rsquo;s a pretty minimal design apart from the line of lenses and the logo.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxEGG4cePg","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The device has one of the best cameras for night-time shooting. The back camera has three sensors and includes a 12MP camera, a 20MP sensor and a TOF 3D camera. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s the 25MP front camera and the AI beatification features too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Oppo phone also has some impressive charging here too. It comes complete with a Super VOOC charger, which means that you can juice it up quickly. There&rsquo;s also 8GB of RAM combined with 128GB of storage too. It&rsquo;s quite the phone!</p>
