<p><span class="postStandFirst">The HTC J Butterfly has been launched on Japanese network KDDI, and it appears to be nothing less than a <i>waterproof</i> HTC One M8, with a much higher-resolution sensor in the Duo Camera. It looks phenomenal, but only time will whether the HTC J Butterfly (or a future phone with the same features) will ever hit store shelves in this country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4780 aligncenter" alt="HTC J Butterfly" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/HTC-J-Butterfly.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></p>
<p>The HTC One M8 is undoubtedly one of the best phones of 2014, with a gorgeous metal body, a super-fast processor, and that Duo Camera that&rsquo;s seemingly made of <i>magic</i>, but we now have a bit of an idea what HTC&rsquo;s <i>next</i> superphone will be like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Japanese operator KDDI has just announced the newest HTC phone to grace its network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the HTC J Butterfly. It&rsquo;s only available in Japan and the best way describe it is as an HTC One M8 that&rsquo;s been updated and improved, whilst at the same time, being <i>waterproofed</i>. This is a sensible addition for HTC to make, as water-resistance is one of the most attractive features of two of the One M8&rsquo;s biggest rivals, namely the Sony Xperia Z2 and the enormously popular Samsung Galaxy S5. Seeing this feature added on to a future version of the HTC One M8 would be a <i>very</i> welcome sight!</p>
<p>The other big change is the camera: where the HTC One M8 has a 4MP Duo Camera, the HTC J Butterfly increases the resolution to a much meatier 13MP. At the same time, it keeps the dual-sensor layout, allowing it to pull off the same party tricks as the current One M8.</p>
<p>In other words, the HTC J Butterfly looks stunning, but the big question is whether it will ever come to the UK (presumably under a different name, with &ldquo;One&rdquo; in it).</p>
<p><strong>The <i>last</i> J Butterfly did eventually reach the USA, but it never came to Britain, so we shall have to cross our fingers and hope that, if it doesn&rsquo;t <i>directly</i> come to Britain, its feature-set will be included in next year&rsquo;s successor to the HTC One M8. We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this one, so stay tuned for more news.&nbsp;</strong></p>
