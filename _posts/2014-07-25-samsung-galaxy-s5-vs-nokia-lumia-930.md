<p><span class="postStandFirst">With the Nokia Lumia 930, Nokia is dead set on entering the superphone arena, but can the phone stand up against the most popular superphone on the market, the Samsung Galaxy S5? We pit the two against each other in a battle royale, scrutinising looks, power, software, camera and special features, to see whether the Nokia Lumia 930 is ready to mix it up with the big boys.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4749 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 vs Nokia Lumia 930" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Samsung-Galaxy-S5-vs-Nokia-Lumia-930.jpeg" width="548" height="496" /></p>
<p>Windows Phone is really starting to find a market for itself; while it may have had a more conservative start to its existence, in terms of sales figures, more and more people are joining the Windows Phone platform.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d say that growth is set to continue, if the newest top-end smartphone from Nokia is anything to go by.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Nokia Lumia 930, and looking at the specifications, Nokia seems to be aiming right at superphone territory with this beauty. Clearly, the Finnish manufacturer (who&rsquo;s now owned by Microsoft) is going after top-end Android superphones like the HTC One M8, or the phenomenal LG G3.</p>
<p>So, it only seems fair that we pit it against just such a superphone, and to make things more difficult for the new Nokia (only because we believe in it!), let&rsquo;s go for perhaps the most popular of them all: the Samsung Galaxy S5...</p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S5 is a <i>really</i> good-looking phone. It&rsquo;s sleek, incredibly slim, and the removable backplates allow you to change the look of the phone (the Electric Blue variant is particularly stunning). However, while the Galaxy S5 is pretty, Nokia has a long history of making <i>iconic</i> phones, and when you look at the Nokia Lumia 930, it really, <i>really</i> shows.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S5 is pretty, but the Lumia 930 is <em>prettier</em>, and so, it wins this round!</p>

<h2>Power</h2>
<p>One of the key features that propels the Nokia Lumia 930 into superphone territory is the inclusion of a 2.2Ghz Snapdragon 800 processor, which, believe me, is quite a potent piece of kit.</p>
<p>However, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a Snapdragon 801 processor, clocked to 2.5GHz, so it&rsquo;s both faster <i>and</i> more power-efficient. So, while the Nokia is powerful, the Samsung is one of the most powerful phones on the market, so it wins this round, taking the score to 1-1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-4752 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 vs Nokia Lumia 930" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" width="960" height="978" /><span class="caption">Image courtesy of samsung.com</span></p>
<h2>Software &amp; Apps</h2>
<p>This category is where things get a little more interesting, because while Android is <i>much</i> more customisable, Windows Phone is arguably more user-friendly. At the same time, while Android has a much bigger selection of apps available, Windows Phone will soon be getting perhaps the best virtual assistant the phone world has ever seen, in the shape of Cortana (yes, <i>that</i> Cortana, the one from HALO).</p>
<p>And so, we have no choice but to call this round a draw!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4683 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 vs Nokia Lumia 930" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-23-at-12.04.49.png" width="447" height="518" /><span class="caption">Image courtesy of nokia.com</span></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Now we come to a category where the Nokia Lumia 930 most definitely has an edge, because when it comes to camera phones, pretty much no one beats Nokia. So, while the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a genuinely great 16MP camera, the Lumia 930 has a 20MP camera, with Carl Zeiss lenses and PureView technology derived from the Nokia Lumia 1020.</p>
<p>And so, the Lumia 930 is the runaway inner in this round!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4684 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 vs Nokia Lumia 930" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-23-at-11.52.43.png" width="570" height="569" /><span class="caption">Image courtesy of nokia.com</span></p>
<h2>Special Features</h2>
<p>When it comes to special features, we&rsquo;ve actually already mentioned the one found in the Nokia Lumia 930, namely the PureView camera technology. It seems to be a bit cheeky to use it twice, but as it turns out, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if we did, because the special feature in the Samsung Galaxy S5 is an unbeatable one: it&rsquo;s water-resistant.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S5, therefore, wins this final round!</p>

<p><strong>And so, we can reach a conclusion, based on the fact that this contest is a stalemate, and the conclusion is this: Nokia has finally made a phone that can compete on a level playing field with the best superphones out there, and that&rsquo;s a fantastic thing! As such, the Nokia Lumia 930 comes highly recommended!&nbsp;</strong></p>
