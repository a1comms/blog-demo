<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You'll master iOS 10 in no time with these cool tips, tricks and hacks!</span></p>
<p>More personal. More powerful. More playful. That's how Apple describes iOS 10 in a nutshell. With the latest updates to apps like iMessage and the lock screen, we're inclined to agree.</p>
<p>Rather than leaving you to the task of working out iOS 10's many amazing features, we've pulled together our 10 absolute best and favourite tips and tricks.</p>
<p>Whether you've just got your new iPhone, or you're experienced but want to know more, our 10 awesome iOS 10 life-hacks will turn anyone into a pro-iPhone-user.</p>
<h2>Does My iPhone Support&nbsp;iOS 10?</h2>
<p>Most iPhones are compatible with iOS 10, or at least those released since 2013. If your iPhone isn't on the list, it's definitely time for an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee?upgrade=1">upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>iPhones compatible with iOS 10: iPhone 7, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, iPhone 6s, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-6s-plus-32gb-rose-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 6s Plus</a>, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5.</p>
<h2>1) Express Yourself in iMessage</h2>
<p>The biggest update iOS 10 brings to iPhones is in messaging. You can now be way more expressive with all kinds of fun and dynamic features in iMessage, from hand-writing love notes to congratulating someone with colourful confetti. You can see exactly what we mean in our Five Fun New Ways to Message in iOS 10 video below.</p>

<h2>2) Change Your&nbsp;Flashlight Brightness</h2>
<p><em>To use this feature, you&rsquo;ll need an iPhone with 3D Touch. That includes iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.</em></p>
<p>Ever found yourself&nbsp;searching for something in a dark room, but trying desperately not to wake someone up? Obviously the light switch was out of the question, and your mobile flashlight was a gamble because it&rsquo;s so damn bright.</p>
<p>What you need for moments like that is something just as handy as your phone, but much less dazzling. The solution? Flashlight intensity controls for your smartphone. Simples.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Drag the control panel up from the base of your screen, then long-press the flashlight icon. That&rsquo;ll launch a choice of intensities made up of Low Light, Medium Light and Bright Light.</p>
<h2>3) Say It Best with Emoji</h2>
<p>They say an emoji speaks a thousand words. Whether that's true, or our proverbs are a little confused, we don't know. But we do know emoji is hot&nbsp;&#x1f4a9;&nbsp;these days.</p>
<p>Apple, always privy to current trends, realises this too and wants to help you embrace all of your favourite emoji, as well as some you might not have ever wanted to use.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12527" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/i-love-pizza.jpg" alt="i-love-pizza" width="600" height="353" /></p>
<p>When composing messages, you can now swap words for emoji. Either tap the emoji in the suggestion bar as you type, or press words that are highlighted yellow (once you switch to the emoji panel) and they&rsquo;ll be instantly converted. Love it or hate it, emoji is taking over!</p>
<h2>4) Clean&nbsp;up the Web</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need us to remind you how littered the Internet is with adverts, clunky designs and other rubbish you&rsquo;ve got no time for.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Safari, Apple&rsquo;s native web browser, is built with a feature called Reader. With Reader switched on, web pages (especially articles) become much cleaner and easier to read.</p>
<p>Reader isn&rsquo;t available on every web page, but you&rsquo;ll know when it is because a menu icon appears adjacent to the search bar at the top of the page. Tap it to turn Reader on, and you&rsquo;ll see just text and photos &ndash; no ads in sight.</p>
<h2>5) Deal with&nbsp;Notifications Like a Boss</h2>
<p>Rather than unlocking and opening your phone every time a friend sends you a message, photo or video, you can both view and respond to them from your lock screen.</p>
<p>When you receive a notification, either swipe left or long-press it to take action (options usually included Reply or Clear depending on the message). No time wasted opening any apps.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12522" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/Rich-Notifications.jpg" alt="rich-notifications" width="600" height="353" /></p>

<h2>6) Raise It to Wake it</h2>
<p>In iOS 10, Apple has introduced a <em>raise to wake</em> feature, which means you don&rsquo;t need to press any buttons to glance at the time or your notifications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Raise to wake your iPhone - there's no need to press a thing. Learn more tips: https://t.co/qliohGUCBg <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS10?src=hash">#iOS10</a> pic.twitter.com/hoNSN5MFUT</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is an especially useful feature since Touch ID got ridiculously responsive; using an iPhone 6s or iPhone 7, you&rsquo;ll see how quickly it unlocks your device, giving you less than a split second to see your lock screen content. <em>Raise to wake</em> solves the issue beautifully.</p>
<p>Enable it by going to Settings > Display &amp; Brightness, then toggle Raise to Wake on.</p>
<h2>7) Master Flashlight Brightness</h2>
<p><em>To make use of this feature, you&rsquo;ll need an iPhone with 3D Touch. That includes iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably experienced a situation where you were searching for something in a dark room, trying desperately not to wake someone up. Obviously the light switch was out of the question, and your mobile flashlight was a gamble because it&rsquo;s so damn bright.</p>
<p>What you needed is something just as handy as your phone, but much less dazzling. The solution? Flashlight intensity controls for your smartphone. Simples.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bet you didn&#39;t know you could change your flashlight brightness. Learn more tips: https://t.co/qliohGUCBg <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS10?src=hash">#iOS10</a> pic.twitter.com/TpjXQblohG</p>
<p>&mdash; Buymobiles (@buymobiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/buymobiles/status/805827219251662848">5 December 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Drag the control panel up from the base of your screen, then long-press the flashlight icon. That&rsquo;ll launch a choice of intensities made up of Low Light, Medium Light and Bright Light.</p>
<h2>8) Put Siri to the Test</h2>
<p>According to Apple, you can &lsquo;talk to Siri as you would to a friend and it can help you get things done.&rsquo; But, exactly, what things? What questions should we ask it? How capable <em>is</em> Siri?</p>
<p>Rather than trying to read and remember all the different commands Siri can action, all you ever have to do is launch it and ask, &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response, you&rsquo;ll get a list of all the wonderful different ways in which Siri is prepared to assist you. Whether that&rsquo;s working out what song is playing on the radio, or asking for directions when you want to get home. You&rsquo;ll also discover that some of your favourite apps are compatible too, like Uber and Facebook.</p>
<h2>9) Quickly Open the Camera</h2>
<p>Occasionally, the most epic photo opportunities present themselves. And as luck tends to have it, they&rsquo;re usually over in a flash, so your fingers need to be quick on the shutter to capture them.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Quickly open your iPhone camera with a swipe. Learn more tips: https://t.co/qliohGUCBg <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS10?src=hash">#iOS10</a> pic.twitter.com/5WuzORmZzz</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In iOS 10, opening the camera is swifter than it&rsquo;s ever been on iPhone. The new quick-launch option on the lock screen lets you swipe left to immediately start taking photos. There isn&rsquo;t even time to say "cheese."</p>
<h2>10) Talk Instead of Typing</h2>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to talk out a message rather than text, either because you&rsquo;ve got your eyes on something else or you&rsquo;re not too comfortable with typing on smartphones. But rather than sending an audio message, a text is more appropriate.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en-gb">

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>iPhones on iOS 10 do of course support you in such situations. The talk-to-type conversion feature does exactly what it says on the tin. Tap the microphone symbol on your keyboard and speak your message (including punctuation). Your iPhone will convert your words into text, ready to send.</p>
