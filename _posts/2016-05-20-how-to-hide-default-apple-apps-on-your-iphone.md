<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Games Center, Stocks and iBooks. Your days are numbered.</span></p>
<p>Minimalist. Simplistic. And restrained. Those are the three magic words I&rsquo;d used to describe Apple&rsquo;s design ethos.</p>
<p>Everything from the hardware to the software feels carefully considered, boiled down to clean, clutter-free elegance. If it wasn&rsquo;t needed, it wasn&rsquo;t included. Apple is one ruthless SOB.</p>
<p>Except that Apple totally lets itself down when it comes to its native apps, like Stocks and Voice Memos, which most of us neither want nor can delete.</p>
<p>In fact, we can&rsquo;t even hide them, so they just sit there on our iPhone screens, staring up at us, wondering what the hell they did so wrong that we haven&rsquo;t touched them for months.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you won&rsquo;t have to endure this awkward atmosphere for much longer, thanks to a clever hack that hides Apple&rsquo;s native apps from your home screen.</p>
<p>Rumour has it, you&rsquo;ll be able to do this hack-free once iOS 10 rolls out, but until then&hellip;</p>
<h2>iOS 9.2 Hack</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>NB If your iOS device is running iOS 9.3 or later, skip ahead to the section below.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Pile Them Up</strong></p>
<p>Hunt down the Apple native apps you want gone before they get a chance to defend themselves, and pile them into one folder. You can do this by holding your finger down on an app icon until it starts to tremble (with fear&hellip;), and drop it on top of another app icon you plan to erase.</p>
<p><strong>2. Drag and desert</strong></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve compiled all unwanted Apple apps in one folder, drag one of the icons to the right, across to the third folder screen. Once you&rsquo;re there, don&rsquo;t releases the app icon, instead keep hold and press the Home button. And it&rsquo;s gone, simple as that. Just repeat for the remaining apps and you&rsquo;ll finally be free of them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Okay, so they&rsquo;re not completely gone.</strong></p>
<p>This hack doesn&rsquo;t permanently delete the apps, or uninstall them, it&rsquo;s just a sneaky way&nbsp;of hiding the icons. You can still access them through Siri, or the search function. And when you restart your device, they&rsquo;ll magically reappear.</p>
<h2>iOS 9.3 Hack</h2>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(100% / 1.33);"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/WearyFittingDromaeosaur" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Fill her up</strong></p>
<p>For this to work you need to have a screen entirely full of apps, including your dock at the base of the Home screen. The apps you want to hide will need to sit on a second screen.</p>
<p><strong>2. Close in on the targets</strong></p>
<p>Hold your finger on an app you to plan to banish and drag it across to the full screen, holding it over any app. This will launch the folder creator.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hasta la vista, baby.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than dropping it in a new folder, keep you grip on that wobbling little cretin and drag it all the way down to the dock, and let go of it there. Bish bash bosh, it's history. Repeat the process for the remaining&nbsp;Apple apps causing your Home screen hell.</p>
<p><strong>Likewise, all apps hidden using this hack can still be accessed, either through Siri or by searching for them. They&rsquo;ll reappear once you restart the device.</strong></p>
