<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Over 100,000 mobiles and laptops fall victim to our drunken negligence.</span></p>
<p>Pub-dwelling Brits leave behind an estimated 138,000 smartphones and laptops a year, according to security firm Eset&rsquo;s recent poll.</p>
<p>The mobile security expert sampled 600 pubs and bars across the country, and found that, on average, 12 devices are abandoned per establishment.</p>
<p>This average, extrapolated over the total number of UK watering holes, results in an alarming approximation of 138,000.</p>
<p>Eset security specialist, Mark James, warns that this figure could grow in the build up to Christmas.</p>
<p>"As we head into the festive season, offices will be preparing for Christmas parties, which will inevitably involve alcohol consumption and people dropping their guard more than usual."</p>
<p>James also revealed that 64% of lost devices aren&rsquo;t safeguarded with security controls, leaving them open to unauthorised prying and potential data breach.</p>
<p>Further results from Eset&rsquo;s pub poll reveal 60% of staff, who&rsquo;ve found a lost mobile phone or laptop, admitted to browsing through the content.</p>
<p>These findings go to highlight the importance of taking out precautions for your mobile phone, especially if you&rsquo;ve been known to enjoy a few pints down at your local.</p>
<p>Other than the obvious, like applying passwords or codes, you should look at insuring your devices to guarantee you&rsquo;re compensated for theft and loss.</p>
<p>Providers, such as Insure My Pocket, offer cover not just for your smartphone, but also for your tablet, laptop and other tech goodies.</p>
<p>You can choose from different levels of cover and tariffs to help meet your budget and requirements, and even pay on a monthly basis to help spread the cost.</p>
<p><strong>Crucially, you won&rsquo;t be out of pocket if (or when&hellip;) you next tumble out of the pub, leaving your poor, neglected smartphone behind.</strong></p>
