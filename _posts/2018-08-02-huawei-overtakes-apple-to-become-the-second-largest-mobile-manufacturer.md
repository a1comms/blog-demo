<p>Congratulations is in order for one Chinese mega-brand. Yes, Huawei has finally reached one of its goals to overtake Apple and become the second largest mobile manufacturer in the world.</p>
<p>Remarkably, in the second quarter of 2018, Huawei dispatched a massive 54.2 million smartphones, which put it ahead of iPhone sales.</p>
<p>Since the powers of Huawei decided to take on the smartphone sector, they have seen a year-over-year increase of 40.9%, according to statistics from IDC. During this crucial quarter, though, Samsung &ndash;&nbsp;the industry leaders &ndash; shipped 71.5 million smartphones, while Apple shipped 41.3 million. That left room for Huawei to slide in between the two brands and swiftly take the second-place position.</p>

<p>So, how did this epic win take place? Well, the people at Huawei have released a press release in which they say that the major success is down to their high standing in China, where the brand has a 27% market share. The flagship phone, Huawei P20, sold a huge seven million units around the globe. What&rsquo;s more, lesser-known devices are popular around the whole of Asia and Europe as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the stats also take into consideration phones that have been released under the &lsquo;Honor&rsquo; name, like Honor 10, which is a brand owned by Huawei. That in itself could have been the factor that has propelled the sales of the company&rsquo;s devices to new heights.</p>
<p>While this latest success is impressive, there&rsquo;s a chance that it won&rsquo;t last forever. <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/iphone-9-rumours-and-release-date-heres-what-weve-heard-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple will be releasing a brand-new line of iPhone</a> around September, which could shake things up a little. Rumour has it that the new line-up will include a more affordable version of the iPhone X, which is sure to be popular with Apple fans.</p>
