<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google Now is in the process of being updated, as the search giant adds in a new feature, one that will remember where you parked your car, just in case you forget. With a list of the address where you left it, and a map to the location, this update to Google Now will make Android phones like the HTC One M8 or Samsung Galaxy S5 even more useful!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many people will undoubtedly know the huge annoyance that comes from parking their car somewhere, and then completely failing to remember where they parked it. Now, though, Google is coming to the rescue.</p>
<p>According to Android Police, Google is in the process of updating their search app, and more specifically, the Google Now part of the search app. And the biggest part of that update?</p>
<p>A parking card. Put simply, Google Now can now remember where you&rsquo;re likely to have parked your car, thus removing the need to go trudging around the town trying to find it. The new parking card not only lists the address where it&rsquo;s parked (if it&rsquo;s in a street somewhere, instead of a car park), but it also shows you a map of the approximate area, showing you how far you are from that location.</p>
<p>So, the basic theory is that if you have an Android smartphone like the HTC One M8 or the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, you no longer need to remember where your car is, making life that little bit easier for you.</p>
<p>In practice, though, it might not <em>always</em> run so smoothly. The parking card can also list alternative places to check where you left the car, in case it gets it wrong first time (although in fairness, having seen how accurate Google Maps navigation actually is, we can say that this is only a <em>very</em> slim, and thus unlikely, possibility), but even then, it&rsquo;s better than wandering for hours, waiting for inspiration to strike and fire the memory neurons up.</p>
<p><strong>If this update isn&rsquo;t automatically being downloaded to your phone through Google Play, you can either wait for it to show as available, or grab it through Android Police. Either way, it&rsquo;s a case of another day, another way Google helps you to save time! </strong></p>
