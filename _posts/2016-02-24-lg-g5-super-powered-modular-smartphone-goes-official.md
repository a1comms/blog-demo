<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Every now and then, a phone is announced which <em>feels</em> like it&rsquo;s got the potential to be a game-changer. There was the first iPhone (which kickstarted the modern smartphone boom), there was the Sony Xperia Z (which brought waterproofing into the world of flagship smartphones), and now, there&rsquo;s <em>this</em>...</span></p>
<p>It is, of course, the LG G5, and it is the first <em>modular</em> smartphone to hit the mainstream.</p>
<h3>Super-Powered Specs</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go into that in more detail in a second, but first, let&rsquo;s take a look at the specs, because even if it didn&rsquo;t have that modularity, the LG G5 would still be one heck of a nice phone. It&rsquo;s powerful, for one thing, with a 64-bit Snapdragon 820 processor and a whopping 4GB of RAM (plus 32GB of onboard storage and a microSD slot). For another thing, it&rsquo;s got a 5.3-inch Quad-HD screen, and that screen comes with &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; functionality, so it displays things like the time and date even when the screen is powered down, in a way that will not <em>muller</em> your battery.</p>
<p>And then, there&rsquo;s the camera, or rather, the <em>cameras</em>, because the LG G5 has <em>two</em> of them (technically <em>three</em>, if we&rsquo;re also including the 8MP camera on the front). Yes, on the back of the phone, you&rsquo;ll find both a standard 16MP camera and a wide-angle 8MP camera, for both close-ups and landscapes. LG also says that the two can work in conjunction, to add post-processing effects, but we&rsquo;re waiting to see how this will work in practice (and whether it will be like the Duo Camera found on the HTC One M8).</p>
<p>Now we move on to the new stuff, though, because while the LG G5 does not have hardware controls (like a shutter button and a dial for zoom) for the camera, at the same time, it <em>sort of</em> does. How can it pull off the feat of both having and not having something?</p>
<p>Simple. Like we said at the start of the article, it&rsquo;s a <em>modular</em> smartphone...</p>
<h3>The Modular Smartphone Goes Mainstream</h3>
<p>Look at a pic of the LG G5; you notice how there&rsquo;s a seam line below the screen, that runs right round the aluminium body (which is, incidentally, <em>achingly</em> pretty), which makes it look like you can pull the bottom end off?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you <em>can</em>, and doing so, in fact, allows you to swap out the battery for a fresh one. It&rsquo;s novel enough to see a phone with a removable battery in this day and age, but there&rsquo;s so much more to it than that, because in addition to replacing the battery, you can <em>also</em> replace that pull-off bottom of the phone. Pop on a dedicated camera expansion module, and your phone gets hardware controls for the camera. Pop on the dedicated audio module (developed by Bang &amp; Olufsen), and your phone gets vastly improved music playback.</p>
<p>On top of that, LG has plans for more modules, and they&rsquo;ve made it so that third parties can make their <em>own</em> modules, so we can expect the functionality of the LG G5 to grow even more in future. In short, it&rsquo;s a simplified version of what Google is planning with Project Ara, and since it <em>is</em> simplified (because the potential problem with Project Ara is that might be a bit <em>too</em> nerdy for the vast majority of smartphone buyers), we reckon that gives it a better chance of taking off in a <em>big</em> way.</p>
<p><strong>Whether it will or not remains to be seen, but we will definitely be keeping a close eye on this bad boy, not least because it might just be an early contender for phone of the year. Stay tuned for more news...</strong></p>
