<p>After what feels like a lifetime of speculation and rumours flying around, we finally have some answers. Yes, this week, tech lovers got what they&rsquo;d been waiting for; HTC finally made its big announcement about its flagship phone: HTC U11.</p>
<p>The event took place in Taipei, and Chialin Chang, the HTC President of Smartphone and Connected Devices, took to the stage to talk about the company&rsquo;s latest offering. At the very centre of the HTC U11, is the &lsquo;squeeze&rsquo; function. You&rsquo;ve probably already seen some teasers for what HTC has revealed to be <em>Edge Sense</em>, and so you must be keen to find out exactly what it is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking about something as natural, as intuitive as &lsquo;squeeze&rsquo;. &nbsp;Imagine a new baby just born, holding on to the mother&rsquo;s fingers for comfort, for safety, for love.&rdquo; explained Chang. &ldquo;A little squeeze for play, to work, express your feeling, express your fear, for all sorts of things; to learn. Squeeze is a natural way for [an] individual person to express your emotions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this somewhat heart-warming speech, Chang asked the audience members to take out their phone and take part in a little experiment. He explained the first area you grip of your phone is the side, and so the HTC U11 will make use of that. It&rsquo;s clear that the idea of squeezing - this niche idea in the world of smartphones - is a big deal for HTC right now.</p>

<p>Of course, that wasn&rsquo;t all. Chang also described how users will be able to combine the squeeze function with a whole load of different features, including AI assistants. Since this is an area where many phone companies are seeking to improve, this is logical. The HTC U11 is supposed to enhance the tech that&rsquo;s already there - to work in sync with it.</p>

<p>Other than the Edge Sense function, the latest HTC is what many of us imagined it would be. It packs much of the modern features that we see from flagship phones right now, including a Snapdragon 835 chipset. What&rsquo;s more, it will also have a &lsquo;glass sandwich&rsquo; design, similar to the HTC U Ultra.</p>

<p>Only time will tell whether this device can rival some of the modern flagship phones on the market right now. One thing&rsquo;s for sure, though, and that&rsquo;s the fact that this latest device <em>does </em>have something new and different to offer and that may be enough to catch people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
