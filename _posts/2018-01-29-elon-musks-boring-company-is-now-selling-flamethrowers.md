<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Mr Elon Musk has followed through on a promise to sell flamethrowers. This is not a <em>fire</em> drill!</span></p>
<p>It may sound like an ill-advised April Fool&rsquo;s prank, but we&rsquo;re still in January and no one&rsquo;s laughing. Elon Musk&rsquo;s Boring Company will soon be selling flamethrowers.</p>
<p>The weapons (because, yes, these are very much weapons!) will cost $500 as part of the pre-order sale, although there&rsquo;s no official word on where in the world they will be shipped.</p>
<h2>Who Are The Boring Company?</h2>
<p>In case you know absolutely nothing about The Boring Company, it&rsquo;s the same business that&rsquo;s currently building an underground car system in Los Angeles. Elon Musk founded it on a whim after being stuck in an endless traffic jam.</p>

<p>The flagship tunnels are not complete yet but will help people beat jams by taking &lsquo;people pods&rsquo; or cars to an array of destinations. It&rsquo;s been widely awaited and Musk has been drumming up a whole load of media attention for himself in the meantime.</p>

<h2>So, What&rsquo;s this About a Flamethrower?</h2>
<p>With that in mind, the company&rsquo;s latest release is a tad weird and actually a bit scary. Musk says that this release will be the "world's safest" flamethrower, which, as we all know, is basically a contradiction in terms. Oh, and for an extra $30, the company will be offering a branded fire extinguisher too. You know, just in case the fire touting weapon isn&rsquo;t exactly as safe as you might imagine.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all very well and good, but surely these things should be illegal, right? Wrong. At least, not in America.</p>
<p>According to Musk, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms allows throwers which have flames shorter than 10 feet. Since this particular flamethrower has a flame that doesn&rsquo;t reach that length, it should be legal to buy and sell in the US. There will initially be a whopping 20,000 of these things on sale. Here's a teaser direct from Elon's Instagram:</p>

<h2>But, Why, Elon?</h2>
<p>Musk previously insinuated that he would be selling flamethrowers after The Boring Company hats sold out. While many may have thought the notion was a mere jest, it seems that he was deadly serious about it. He&rsquo;s doing it, regardless of how painfully terrible this move could be.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After 50k hats, we will start selling The Boring Company flamethrower</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/940056523304181762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While it may be nothing more than a novelty item right now, we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that these items are extremely dangerous. PR stunt or not, supplying people with potentially lethal weapons in mass is a rather risky game to play. But, for some bizarre reason, Musk is playing it.</p>
