<p>Smart wearables are starting to pop up everywhere, and they&rsquo;re finally fashionable enough that we don&rsquo;t look like Dick Tracy every time we answer a call on our wrists.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great, though, aside from all of the smart features, like notifications and communication tools, is that these wearables are becoming very accomplished at tracking fitness performance, and encouraging you to reach your goals.</p>
<p>Owning a fitness&nbsp;wearable is almost like having a personal coach on your wrist, barking orders, monitoring your progress, and ensuring you don&rsquo;t spend all day on the sofa watching trash on TV.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve complied 10 of our favourite fitness&nbsp;wearables. See which made number one&hellip;</p>
<h2>10. Samsung Gear Fit 2</h2>
<p>Featuring a curved display, heartrate monitor and built-in GPS, the second generation fitness-focused band is not just fun and funky, but also very good for the active minded.</p>
