<p><span class="postStandFirst">Microsoft has announced that its Microsoft Health app, which is compatible with Android, iOS <em>and</em> Windows phones, does not require you to buy any extra fitness accessories to work. Might this be the perfect way to stay in shape, <em>and</em> save money at the same time?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6599 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Microsoft-Health.png" alt="Microsoft Health" width="571" height="587" /></p>
<p>Many people have said that health and fitness apps are <em>the</em> next big thing in smartphones, but one thing that might have previously put people off is the fact that you&rsquo;d need a separate fitness tracker to really get the most out of them.</p>
<p>According to the Microsoft Devices Blog, that might not be the case for much longer, as the software giant has now announced that its new Health app will <em>not</em> require you to use a separate fitness tracker!</p>
<p>While it might seem odd for this news to be announced on the Microsoft <em>Devices</em> Blog, not least because it&rsquo;s a <em>dual</em> announcement alongside Microsoft&rsquo;s own fitness tracker, the Microsoft Band, it is nonetheless the case that the Microsoft Health app can be downloaded and used without having to buy any extra hardware at all.</p>
<p>Instead, Microsoft Health can use &ldquo;the sensors contained in many Android Phones, iPhones and Windows Phones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the <em>other</em> big news: Microsoft Health is <em>not</em> limited to working only on Windows phones, so if you&rsquo;re using something like Samsung Galaxy S6 or HTC One M9, or even an iPhone 6, you&rsquo;ll be able to take advantage of the new app!</p>
<p>So, if you were looking for a great way to manage your fitness regime through your smartphone, it may well be that Microsoft Health has the answer for you.</p>
<p><strong>And since doing so doesn&rsquo;t require the purchase of any extra accessories (although you&rsquo;ll of course be able to fully access more features if you do), it may well save you money as well!</strong></p>
