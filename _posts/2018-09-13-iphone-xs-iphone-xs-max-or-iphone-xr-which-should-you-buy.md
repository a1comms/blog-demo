<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Not two, but THREE new iPhone models!</span></p>
<p>The new iPhone lineup has finally been announced and we&rsquo;re ready to see what the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a>, iPhone Xs Max, and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/iphone-xr-learn-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone XR</a> have in store for us. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting to upgrade to a brand-new handset, you may be wondering which of these shiny new phones you should choose. Well, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m_K2Yg7wGQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>It should come as no real surprise to find that all of the new iPhones have a somewhat minimal design. The iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max both sport a nearly bezeless (all-screen) look and come in stainless steel. The former is the smallest of all the models that Apple released yesterday, coming in at 5.8 inches. The iPhone Xs Max version of the device lives up to its name offering a huge 6.5-inch design. It also has a split-screen functionality to make use of all that space! The iPhone Xs lineups come in just three colours &ndash; Silver, Gold, and Space Grey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s the jazzier iPhone XR to consider. The device certainly has more colour options, boasting Black, White, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Coral. However, it doesn&rsquo;t have the stainless steel casing and instead sports an aluminium look. Coming in at 6.1 inches, it&rsquo;s bang in the middle of the two iPhone Xs phones which could suit most people &ndash;&nbsp;not too big, but not too small either. The home button has been dropped from all of the new iPhones, which means that you get the all-screen display here too.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Remember the fancy Super Retina OLED that we first saw on the iPhone X last year? Well, it&rsquo;s back again. Yes, both the iPhone Xs and the iPhone Xs Max are fitted with this beauty. That means that you get stunning clarity when using these devices. Think vibrant colours and a seriously crisp finish. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>The iPhone XR doesn&rsquo;t boast the same technological luxury, but it does have a top-of-the-range screen. The LCD offering is supposedly one of Apple&rsquo;s best so far and they&rsquo;ve gone with the name Liquid Display for this one. Will it do the job? Only time will tell but it&rsquo;s sure to still make everything look pretty awesome on your screen.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, none of the devices have a home button. That&rsquo;s a thing of the past &ndash;&nbsp;a relic. That&rsquo;s what allows the phones to have the super chic and minimal designs they now sport. All of the iPhones also have Face ID and will run the latest version of iOS too. So, it&rsquo;s fair to say that there&rsquo;s very little between each of them.</p>
<p>However, both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max have improved AR gaming which, thanks to its snazzy screens, is certain to be an experience in itself. If you&rsquo;re an avid gamer, getting one of these devices for the finest quality experience could be the way to go.</p>

<h2>Battery Power and Performance</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all very well and good but how long will these devices stay juiced up? Well, since the iPhone Xs Max is the biggest, it comes with the largest battery. Apple claims that this pack will keep the phone running for up to 15 hours of video playback. The iPhone Xs has a slightly lower claim, and Apple says that it will run for up to 14 hours of video playback. Considering these devices pack all of the latest tech, that battery life is impressive. The iPhone XR takes the crown here, though, with an alleged 16 hours of playback.</p>
<p>When it comes down to performance, there should be nothing between these devices. Each of the new iPhones has the new A12 Bionic chip, which sounds uber futuristic. They also have 6-core CPU and a 4-core GPU to help make them more efficient. Apple says that the phones have real-time machine learning, the apps will now launch 30% faster and AR features will function better than ever before.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Up until now, you might be thinking that the brand-new iPhones are all pretty similar. Think again. The camera offerings are really what differentiates the iPhone Xs models from the iPhone XR device.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a major shock that both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max have the same setup. On the back, we&rsquo;re looking at a dual-lens, with a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens. The selfie camera is a 7-megapixel lens.</p>
<p>The iPhone XR can&rsquo;t compete with those specs, but perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t need to. It&rsquo;s a single lens 12-megapixel offering on the back and the same 7-megapixel lens on the front. However, Apple says that this is one of the best single lens setups yet. It can offer Portrait Mode photos without needing the dual-lens to help it along the way. So, perhaps most of us will get along fine without the extra lens that the iPhone Xs has.</p>

<h2>Prices and Release Dates</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s just over a month between the release dates of the iPhone Xs devices and the iPhone XR. Both the iPhone Xs and the iPhone Xs Max will be available as of &nbsp;21st September.</p>
<p>These two phones are the flagship devices and, as such, have flagship prices. The iPhone Xs will start at &pound;999 while the iPhone Xs Max comes in at &pound;1099. If you&rsquo;re willing to wait a little longer, though, the iPhone XR will be a little better for your bank account. The device should be available from 26th October and will start from &pound;749.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here &ndash;&nbsp;there&rsquo;s no denying the fact that both the iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max are the superior devices. They are. With a Super Retina Display, flawless design, and a camera that is set to wow, it&rsquo;s clear to see why people will fall for these devices. However, the price is at the top end, which could put some people off. If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting a little longer and having slightly lower specs, the iPhone XR is a great and more affordable option. Plus, it comes in some funky colours, which is a real bonus.</p>
