<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Self-improvement? There&rsquo;s an app for that!</span></p>
<p>With the New Year just around the corner, you may well be considering ways in which you can make 2018 the best year yet. Resolutions tend to get a bad rap, especially as many people simply fail to stick to them. If that sounds familiar, here are ten little apps that you really need in your life.</p>
<h2>1) Eat Healthy When You Eat Out</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16079" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IfodLfdd9h9hl14Yk5d0LQ_iXCwTFL3qPZSVChqWzSq88A5fXHQumkt2m0vSFa56oTZwxU6ipRuTntuXq7wvepOIow=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Eating well is a fantastic resolution and easy enough to accomplish when you&rsquo;re at home and making your own meals. But what about when you eat out? Luckily, HealthyOut has your back.</p>
<p>This app lists the healthiest (low-carb, low-fat etc.) dishes from restaurants across the country, and is available in 500 cities in the UK. Before you head out for your New Year&rsquo;s Day meal, be sure to check HealthyOut first.</p>
<p><em>Download HealthyOut for free on iOS | Android</em></p>
<h2>2) Get Those Abs You've Been Wanting</h2>

<p>Of course, being healthy doesn&rsquo;t just mean eating the right things; it&rsquo;s also about exercising too. As 2018 dawns, many of us will resolve to be more active and fitter.</p>
<p>The Nike Training Club app could help you with just that. With over 100 exercise routines and a whole load of help and advice, you may just find it gives your workout regime the kickstart it really needs.</p>
<p><em>Download Nike Training Club for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/nike+-training-club-workouts/id301521403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.ntc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></em></p>
<h2>3) Manage Your Time a Little Better</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16080" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X7Fg3sxKInG84BatCOlKTy7GucHkcpS-QvGzNTc-AtwBkGiSorhv2TesawO5GPgl8v6gbZGYtdeNChxj2LdwYdYM4A=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you <em>love </em>to get more stuff done during the day? Well, if 2017 has been less-than-productive, you need Toggl in your life.</p>
<p>This app allows you to time certain tasks and projects so you can work out what, exactly, is eating into your day. It&rsquo;s particularly useful if you have a job that requires completing several small chores throughout the day. It&rsquo;s free to sign up, so you have no excuse, really.</p>
<p><em>Download Toggl for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toggl/id1291898086?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | Android</em></p>
<h2>4) Save Some Money</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16074" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jiWzW8XcvGvRI3Ch-d73PfSELhyetiI4w0m7IBmcERKj8hUCAsT6r6OMmaPh9XCF-usJThL_RYveaeXxuhx7qih9=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Living from payday to payday? One of the most popular resolutions of 2018 is sure to be saving more money. Of course, often enough, that&rsquo;s easier said than done&hellip;</p>
<p>Squirrel links with your Barclays bank account to change the way you use your cash. It splits your income into three different sections and only releases a little into your account at a time.</p>
<p>That means that you can&rsquo;t blow your whole wage the first weekend you get it (sorry, ravers!) and that you could ultimately end up saving a lot more cash.</p>
<p><em>Download the Squirrel for free on iOS | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.squirrel.squirrel_mobile&amp;utm_source=squirrel&amp;utm_campaign=website_footer&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;_branch_match_id=475328904553011911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></em></p>
<h2>5) Learn a New Language. Finally.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16075" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bh5AW88tR9vUVGg8irY5GJjcQ76157j5xFSRtRMRu3eEEur0shnw-nYnmWnR9zOcoW3o6bcrvYB74RPe0Rc-i6Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Learning a language is no small feat. It takes time and patience to get anywhere with such a task. Duolingo allows you to fit short and simple language lessons into your lifestyle with ease.</p>
<p>All you have to do is open the app when you feel like giving it a go. The game-like format means that the lessons never get dull. Learn a whole range of languages with this one.</p>
<p><em>Download Duolingo for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french-and-more/id570060128?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;hl=en&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dduolingo.com%26utm_medium%3Dduolingo_web%26utm_content%3Ddownload_button%26utm_campaign%3Dsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></em></p>
<h2>6) Quit Smoking for Good!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16076" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jhjX-m_anU2-kjOgdo2imJUIqRyGi-Dzk8J3qfpu4E3v3m6qp0LF9E3i3jG3MCdSB_G6fwBE07OIbybsmCkj9gNA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to live a smoke-free lifestyle, the LIVESTRONG MyQuit Coach could be what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Tracking your progress as you quit the habit will help you stay on the road to success. What&rsquo;s more, this app gives you helpful hints and advice along the way. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but nothing that&rsquo;s worth doing is.</p>

<p>Make no mistakes here, we all need a little headspace now and then. Whether you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just generally a little anxious, learning to take a step back and relax could be the answer.</p>
<p>Stop, Breathe &amp; Think is the mindful app that helps you take stock of your feelings and sort them out. You can learn to meditate, change your perspective, and generally relax a little. That&rsquo;s something we can all get behind.</p>
