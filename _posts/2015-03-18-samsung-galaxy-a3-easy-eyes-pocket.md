<p><span class="postStandFirst">While the top-end Galaxy S6 might be grabbing all the headlines, Samsung Galaxy A3 has been quietly making a name for itself as a brilliant smartphone for people on a tighter budget. Join us as we take a look at just why that is...</span></p>
<p><span class="postStandFirst"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6402 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/SM-A300F_010_Set_Black-1024x682.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A3" width="960" height="639" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;re all familiar with just how brilliant Samsung&rsquo;s top-end flagship phones are. However, while phones such as Samsung Galaxy S6 grab all the headlines, the Korean manufacturer has a whole range of brilliant smartphones to suit people on tighter budgets.</p>
<p>One of the best of these budget smartphones is the gorgeous Samsung Galaxy A3.</p>
<p>Gone are the days that a budget smartphone would come with a tiny screen; we&rsquo;ve seen it with the likes of Motorola Moto G 4G, and we see it with Galaxy A3, as it has a sizeable 4.5-inch screen. The resolution comes in at 960 x 540 pixels, and while that&rsquo;s obviously not as high as the Quad HD screen on its top-end sibling, it&rsquo;s still going to look nice and sharp.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6403 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/SM-A300FZKUBTU-784371-2-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A3 - Display" width="960" height="512" /></p>
<p>Performance won&rsquo;t be an issue, either, as Galaxy A3 comes with a next-gen quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor (a chip designed specifically to make mid-range phones a lot faster) and 1GB of RAM. At the same time, the phone uses Android KitKat, which has all sorts of optimisations to make it run faster on mid-range phones, and that&rsquo;s going to make the performance even better!</p>
<p>Basically, expect Samsung Galaxy A3 to be an absolute joy to use!</p>
<p>In terms of features, the two cameras on the phone really go above and beyond what you might expect from a mid-ranger; the rear camera comes in at 8-megapixels, which is brilliant on its own, but it&rsquo;s paired with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that&rsquo;s absolutely perfect for selfies!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6404 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/SM-A300FZKUBTU-335734-1-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A3 - Selfie" width="960" height="512" /></p>
<p>And so, Samsung Galaxy A3 is at least a little bit glorious. It&rsquo;s fast and responsive, the front camera is <em>brilliant</em>, and it&rsquo;s an absolute joy to use. Combine that with the sleek body, and it&rsquo;s fair to say that Samsung has hit another home run!</p>
