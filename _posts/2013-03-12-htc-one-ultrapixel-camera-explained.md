<p><span class="postStandFirst">The HTC One features a revolutionary 'UltraPixel' camera, but what does this really mean and what can we expect from it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/htc_one.jpg" width="171" height="354" />The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/htc/htc-one">HTC One</a>&nbsp;caused a stir when it was unveiled recently, and for once, not&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the buzz around it was due to the incredible processor (a fantastically fast&nbsp;<em>next-gen</em>&nbsp;Snapdragon 600) or the pin-sharp 1080p screen, which comes in at 4.7 inches, making it&nbsp;<em>sharper</em>&nbsp;than rival 1080p phones such as the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia Z</a>.</strong></p>
<p>No, a large part of the buzz was down to the&nbsp;<em>camera</em>&nbsp;inside the HTC One, because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;<em>only</em>&rsquo; a 4 megapixel camera. You&rsquo;ll note, however, that the &lsquo;only&rsquo; is in speech marks, and there is a very good reason for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the HTC One uses what manufacturer HTC calls an &lsquo;UltraPixel&rsquo; camera, and its that part which makes the camera so special. While it may be &lsquo;only&rsquo; a 4 megapixel camera, it&rsquo;s a 4 megapixel camera where each individual pixel on the image sensor is roughly&nbsp;<em>three</em>&nbsp;times bigger than on a&nbsp;<em>standard</em>&nbsp;image sensor; the image sensor itself takes up roughly the same amount of space as a 12 megapixel sensor would take up, and while its resolution is a lot lower, it can capture roughly the same amount of light as that larger sensor. The end result is a camera that performs exceptionally well in low light conditions, something that&rsquo;s also aided by the optical image stabilisation built into the phone, a feature only previously found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/nokia/nokia-lumia-920">Nokia Lumia 920</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But why did HTC choose to use a 4 megapixel sensor in the HTC One?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/htc_one_black.jpg" width="175" height="353" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly down to the sheer size of the sensor, which takes up about as much room, physically, as a 12 megapixel sensor. HTC could have made the camera bigger, but it would have increased the size of the phone considerably. There is another reason, however, and it&rsquo;s one that can be gleaned by looking at the HTC One&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>The concept of sharing things is built into modern smartphones, and this is especially apparent in the HTC One. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable, in fact, to say that the HTC One is built around online interactions, and sharing. Once seen from this viewpoint, the 4 megapixel sensor makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>Put simply, the UltraPixel sensor captures incredible amounts of light, which leads to better photos, while the proportionally lower resolution of the output images keeps the file sizes a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;smaller. As such, the HTC One produces smaller photos, that won&rsquo;t use as much of your data allowance when sharing them, but which look better than every&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;photo taken on a 4 megapixel camera.</p>
<p>The UltraPixel camera, then, is a camera designed around the concept of sharing your photos online, and when viewed through that lens (no pun intended, although it does also include a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;impressive lens), the HTC One&rsquo;s camera makes perfect sense.</p>
<p><strong>To put it simply, if you like to share your photos online, via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/BuyMobiles?ref=hl">Facebook</a>, Flickr, or one of the myriad other photo sharing services, then this is the&nbsp;<em>perfect</em>&nbsp;phone for you!</strong></p>
