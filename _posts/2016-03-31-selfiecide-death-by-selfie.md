<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Join us as we take a look at the disturbing phenomenon of &ldquo;death by selfie&rdquo;, where people have actually died trying to capture that ultimate photo, and at what measures could be taken to help prevent this tragedy from happening...</span></p>
<p>A new phenomenon kicked off after mobile phones started including cameras. We&rsquo;re talking, of course, about the rise of the selfie, and it seemed that when people started carrying cameras with them 24/7, the thing they most wanted to do was to take photos of&hellip; themselves.</p>
<p>The trouble is, a simple selfie isn&rsquo;t enough for some people, and they go to extreme lengths to try and capture that <em>once in a lifetime </em>selfie. And we mean that in a literal sense, as people have died trying to take those extreme selfies (in fact, in 2015, more people died while taking selfies than by shark attack).</p>
<p>While the instinct might be there to nominate anyone who has done that for a Darwin Award, we should perhaps use this as opportunity for a public service announcement, and look at some of the things that common sense should (but in some cases doesn&rsquo;t) dictate you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> do when taking a selfie.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that we don&rsquo;t even have to go back very far to show some of the dangers, as according to Wikipedia, there have been 8 reported human deaths (and one potential dolphin death, although that one remains disputed) from taking selfies in 2016 alone. Most of them involve long falls, with people climbing to unsafe places to get that ultimate photo, such as the 19 year old Filipino student who fell to her death from doing just that, or the student in India who fell from the Waldevi Dam, and drowned.</p>
<p>Selfies and large bodies of water also don&rsquo;t mix, as several of the reported deaths were from drowning (one being a girl taking selfies on a rock, who did not notice the high tide, and was dragged away with it).</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising of all, however, is the report of the Washington man who, a mere handful of weeks ago, accidentally shot himself while taking a selfie.</p>
<p>It has become such a problem that many places have banned the taking of selfies altogether (although of course, not all of them are because of related deaths; some are due to things like people trying to take selfies while voting in the UK General Election, which is most definitely illegal). One place that has definitely banned selfies (at least in certain hotspots where there have been several incidents) is Mumbai in India; a large number of the reported deaths by selfie have been from India or other parts of Asia, so it is perhaps not surprising that those countries would be the first to ban selfies for this reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the vast majority of selfie-related deaths have been people in their teens and twenties; it may be that banning the selfie will not, in the long run, be a workable solution, so perhaps education is the better option, teaching young people not to take stupid risks in order to get a potentially better photo. India has taken the lead on this, with Deepak Gandhi setting up the website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.selfietodiefor.org">www.selfietodiefor.org</a>, &ldquo;as a movement to create awareness about taking selfies responsibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ultimately, what it comes down to is this: there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking selfies. Most people do it, after all. Just use common sense, and don&rsquo;t become a statistic, because <em>no</em> photo is worth that... </strong></p>
