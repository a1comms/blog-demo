<p><span class="postStandFirst">With CES in full swing, it&rsquo;s time to take a look at the news from Las Vegas, and see what juicy titbits have been unveiled about the mobile industry; there&rsquo;s new phones, there&rsquo;s new technology, and there&rsquo;s news of an alliance that might just make the smartphone world a whole lot cooler...</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s once again time for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and while it&rsquo;s not as big a fixture of the industry&rsquo;s calendar as, say, the Mobile World Congress, we nonetheless do see some cool, new, phone-related stuff being unveiled at CES.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a look at the hardware-related news from CES 2015.</p>
<h2><strong>LG G Flex 2 unveiled </strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6191" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/01/G-Flex2_2-1024x1004.jpg" alt="G Flex2_2" width="590" height="578" />LG has been on a roll recently, releasing a whole slew of brilliant smartphones (including one of the best smartphones to <em>ever</em> hit the market, the LG G3). One of the Korean manufacturer&rsquo;s most intriguing phones was the LG G Flex, with its curved screen, and now it&rsquo;s getting a sequel.</p>
<p>Everything about the LG G Flex 2 has been beefed up, compared to its predecessor. The processor is a next-gen <em>octa-core</em> Snapdragon 810 chip, the curved glass on the screen has been 20% tougher, and most excitingly of all, the self-healing back cover has made a triumphant return, now able to heal minor scratches in a mere 10 seconds!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft unveils the Nokia 215</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6192" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/01/Nokia-215-internet-jpg.jpg" alt="Nokia-215-internet-jpg" width="494" height="494" /></p>
<p>Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t released flagship smartphones since it bought Nokia, instead focusing on the mid-range, and the Nokia 215 is the company&rsquo;s most inexpensive smartphone yet. Granted, it doesn&rsquo;t look much like what we&rsquo;d expect from a modern smartphone, but while it may look like an old school entry-level phone (and while it offers 2G data only, suggesting it is aimed at developing markets), it can also run apps like Facebook, Opera Mini, Twitter and Bing Search.</p>
<h2><strong>HTC Desire 826 gets a new UltraPixel &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; camera</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6193" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/01/htcdesire826official-1024x853.jpg" alt="htcdesire826official" width="571" height="475" /></p>
<p>One of the minor trends of 2014 looks like it&rsquo;s going to carry on into 2015, because HTC is working on <em>another</em> phone whose key feature is the &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; camera on the front. In the case of the new HTC Desire 826, however, that selfie camera is one of HTC&rsquo;s now-famous UltraPixel shooters, with physically bigger pixels than a normal camera. That means you&rsquo;ll be able to take vastly better selfies, in much poorer light conditions. Your nightclub selfies are about to get a lot better!</p>
<h2><strong>Big news for the future: companies join up to standardise wireless charging</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news of the show, from a hardware perspective, is the news that the people behind wireless chargers are coming together to form a supergroup. What that means is that there quite possibly won&rsquo;t be multiple competing standards for wireless charging in future, which would be a brilliant thing indeed, as it would mean that more phones could come with one set way of wirelessly charging, and you&rsquo;d be guaranteed that your phone would be compatible with the wireless chargers out there in the world.</p>
<p>At the moment, just two of the three wireless charging providers have signed up to the merger (the Power Matters Alliance, PMA, and The Alliance For Wireless Power, A4WP), with the Wireless Power Consortium being the third player who&rsquo;s yet to join. However, Qualcomm (a member of both PMA and A4WP) has stated that the new merged group is ready to connect with WPC (who pioneered the Qi charging standard).</p>
<p>So perhaps one day, we will <em>finally</em> see an era of complete interoperability between wireless chargers.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for more news from CES 2015! </strong></p>
