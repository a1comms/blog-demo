<h3><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Oh, go on! It only takes a few minutes</span></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a treat for all you Android users out there. If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of trying to &lsquo;revamp&rsquo; your phone and give it a makeover yourself, we&rsquo;ve got something just for you.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many ways to customise Android phones and some you may not even know about just yet. But how on earth do you choose from this vast array of customisable options? Well, if you&rsquo;re ready for a whole new phone experience, you may well want to take the #myAndroid Taste Test! Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h3>What do you need to do?</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how you take the test first. So, you need to head to the <a href="https://www.android.com/myandroid/taste-test/#/">#myAndroid Taste Test </a>online. Once you&rsquo;ve followed the link, you will be directed to a simple to use test page where you can play the game for yourself. It&rsquo;s easy and just takes a few minutes to complete. Oh, and don&rsquo;t worry your head, this is so <i>not </i>the kind of test that you need to revise for! Phew.</p>
<p>As soon as you get started, you will be confronted with 22 super fast questions that you have to answer in an instant. The idea here is that these questions will reveal things about your own personal sense of style, your character, and your likes and dislikes. You shouldn&rsquo;t spend ages pondering over the so-called &lsquo;right&rsquo; answer either. Instead, you just need to look at the questions and tap the answer (or picture) that appeals the most to you.</p>
<p>The final phase of the questions is less to do with your sense of style and more to do with what you do on your Android phone. You will find that the quiz asks you what you use your phone for and, of course, how often you&rsquo;re on it! Once you&rsquo;re done, it&rsquo;s time to get those all-important results.</p>
<h3>What do you get from the test?</h3>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve answered all of the above, you may be wondering what the point is anyway. When you get the results, all will very much be revealed. It will actually give you suggestions on everything from wallpapers to widgets! That means that you can customise your phone to suit your taste in mere seconds. What&rsquo;s more, the results will link you to particular apps and the like in the Google Play store, and so you can find ones that will suit you in no time.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;ve selected that you like music, you will be given a whole load of music apps from which to choose. Equally, if you listed news as one of your interests, you will find that there are a whole load of publications widgets there too. In short, the idea is that the #myAndroid Taste Test helps you to find ways to customise your device according to what you like and don&rsquo;t. It only takes a few minutes too, so why not give it a go, eh?</p>
