<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Android users, leave your wallet at home. Android Pay is here.</span></p>
<p>Google launched Android Pay in the UK in May 2016, bringing tap-and-go contactless payments to millions of Android users.</p>
<p>Any smartphone or tablet fitted with NFC, and running Android 4.4 or higher, is compatible with Google&rsquo;s contactless&nbsp;payment system.</p>
<p>Like Apple Pay, the equivalent feature for iPhones, Android Pay means you no longer require your bank card to pay for items in store &ndash; so long as you&rsquo;ve already added the details.</p>
<p>Just like you would with a contactless debit or credit card, you can simply tap your Android device to an NFC-enabled payment terminal, to complete a transaction.</p>
<p>Security&rsquo;s tight, just to reassure you. In the unsavoury scenario that your phone is pinched, Android Pay only works if the mobile is unlocked. And in any case, you can use Android Device Manager to ensure your device is locked, updated with a new password or even wiped clean.</p>
<p>Because you can keep track of your purchases, thanks to the instant payment confirmation that indicates the transaction location, merchant&rsquo;s name and number, you&rsquo;ll spot any unauthorised activity before it gets too damaging.</p>
<h2>Which retailers accept Android Pay?</h2>
<p>Actually, you can use Android Pay in any location that accepts contactless payments. So anywhere you find one of the below symbols will be primed and ready. Just ask if you&rsquo;re not sure.</p>

<p>These are just some of the major retailers that are fully on board with contactless payments.</p>

<h2>How do I set Android Pay up?</h2>
<p>1) Setting Android Pay up is super simple. First of all, look to see if you already the app installed on your smartphone. Many come with it pre-loaded. If you don&rsquo;t, download it from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&amp;hl=en_GB">Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>2) If you&rsquo;ve already registered a card with your Google account, add it to Android Pay by confirming a few details, or add a new one following the steps. You can even use your camera.</p>
<p>3) Now that you&rsquo;ve added your card, you can start using Android Pay. Just make sure your device is unlocked when you do.</p>
<h2>Which banks support Android Pay?</h2>
<p><em>Below information accurate as of 01/08/2018.</em></p>
<p>Many major UK banks are set up with&nbsp;Android Pay, including AIB GB, Amex, Bank of Scotland, B Bank, Clydesdale Bank, The Co-operative Bank, The Cumberland, First Direct, First Trust Bank, Halifax, HSBC, Isle of Man Bank, Lloyds Bank, John Lewis, Lloyds, M&amp;S Bank, MBNA, Metro Bank, Monese, Monzo, Nationwide,&nbsp;NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Smile, TSB, Ulster Bank and Yorkshire Bank.</p>
<h2>What happens if I lose my phone?</h2>
<p>OK, so Android Pay sounds great so far, but what happens if you lose your phone? Hopefully it&rsquo;s not something you to have experience, but you should enjoy total peace of mind if it does. Using Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.android.com/devicemanager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Device Manager</a>, you can remotely lock your mobile, change the password, or, in extreme cases, wipe it totally clean of any personal information.</p>
