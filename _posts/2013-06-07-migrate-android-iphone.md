<p><span class="postStandFirst">Android, Google&rsquo;s powerhouse of a mobile operating system, has a huge global usage thanks to the wide selection of devices it is available on.</span></p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s top mobile manufacturers have embraced the OS wholeheartedly, taking advantage of Android open source qualities. This is also why Android devices are so popular with consumers; they are simple, intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<p>However, that said it is hard to ignore the lure of the iPhone and Apple&rsquo;s iOS. The operating system has that sleek, polished feel that keeps users coming back time and again.</p>
<p>If you are an Android user making the switch to iOS, moving with all your virtual valuables intact can be a daunting proposition. As long as you take some time and are prepared to be patient, you won&rsquo;t lose anything from your old device &ndash; and here&rsquo;s how.</p>
<h2>Moving Contacts from Android to iPhone</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.colourmylearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/screen2-180x300.jpg" width="180" height="300" /></p>
<p>Some one of the most important data that users switching operating systems need is their contacts list. Our smartphones can do an awful lot these days but we still need them for the simple task of staying in touch with friends and family.</p>
<p>Most carriers make it easy to bring your contacts from one device to another. This can even be done on-the-spot in-store when you buy your iPhone but for the DIY option you&rsquo;ll need to backup your contacts as a .vcf file.</p>
<p>This can be done by selecting Import/Export from the Settings menu, then &lsquo;Send namecard via Gmail&rsquo;. Select all your contacts and they&rsquo;ll be compressed into .vcf file and sent to an email address of your choice.</p>
<p>Then go to Mail on your iPhone and open the .vcf attachment. Select &lsquo;Add All Contacts&rsquo; to import all your contact into your new address book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Moving photos and videos from Android to iPhone</h2>

<p>Perhaps not quite as important as contacts but still annoying to lose is all the photos and videos we carry on our phones. We may not look at these photos all that often but it would be devastating to lose them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, migrating photos and videos from Android mobile phones to an iPhone is a pretty straightforward task. All you need is a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

<p>Hook your Android phone up to your computer via a USB cable and select the option to view the device as a disc drive rather than run the PC Companion software that manufacturers offer.</p>
<p>This will allow you to view the content on your phone as if it was a memory stick or external hard drive so you can just copy the files you want and save them on your computer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up your new iPhone, it&rsquo;s simply a case of dragging and dropping these files on to iTunes and syncing them with your device.</p>
<p>You can even use Apple&rsquo;s iCloud to store all your music, photo, apps, mail and more to make content even more accessible.</p>

<p>Google and Apple seem to be in constant battle with each other. This can be good for consumers as it drives down prices and makes for great iPhone deals but can also make switching between systems a little tricky.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more felt than when it comes to moving apps from one to device to another as, in a nut shell, it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Lots of apps are available on both platforms but you&rsquo;ll need to download them again as they are essentially different programs. Some developers allow you to have the iOS version of an app for free if you&rsquo;ve already downloaded it on Android but these are few and far between.</p>
