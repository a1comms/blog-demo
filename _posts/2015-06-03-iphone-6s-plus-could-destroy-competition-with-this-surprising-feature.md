<p><span class="postStandFirst">A rumour has appeared, stating that iPhone 6S Plus will have a Quad-HD screen, the first of its kind on any iPhone ever. If true, this should make the top-end smartphone wars far more interesting.</span></p>
<p>After years of claiming big phones weren&rsquo;t something people were interested in, Apple shocked the world&nbsp;in 2014 by unveiling, well, a big phone, in iPhone 6 Plus. Now, rumours claim we&rsquo;re due for a successor.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-6s-plus-set-to-get-galaxy-note-4-s-killer-feature-1295657">TechRadar</a>, that successor (iPhone 6S Plus) may well have a new feature to better compete against the likes of Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>While iPhone 6S is rumoured to be equipped with the same 4.7-inch screen (which has a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels) seen in the current iPhone 6, the iPhone 6S Plus is rumoured to be getting a 5.5-inch screen (same size as iPhone 6 Plus) with an updated resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.</p>
<p>Yes, if the rumour is true, then iPhone 6S Plus is going to have an ultra-sharp Quad-HD screen, to allow it to compete more effectively with top-end Android phones that already flaunt that feature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no indication as to the veracity of this rumour, as yet, although some are pointing out that a screen with a resolution that high is going to put a serious toll on the battery in the next iPhone.</p>
<p>Whether this indicates that Apple has included an improved battery in the new phone, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Until this is confirmed by Apple directly, we must treat this latest titbit of information as pure rumour. Nonetheless, we will be watching like hawks to see how <em>this</em> one develops. Stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
