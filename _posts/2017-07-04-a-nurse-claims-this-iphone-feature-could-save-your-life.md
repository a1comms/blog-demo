<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You need to know about this potentially life-saving iPhone feature.</span></p>
<p>From finding a hot date to ordering some even hotter food (yum!), you can use your smartphone for pretty much anything these days. Yes, these neat little gadgets open up a whole world of opportunities for us via their many apps. Let&rsquo;s face it - if you can imagine it, you can bet your bottom dollar that there&rsquo;s already an app for it.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that there are some things that smartphones just can&rsquo;t do. They can&rsquo;t make you a cup of tea, drive you to work, or save your life... Or can they? In the case of the latter, these high-tech gadgets may be more accomplished than you know.</p>
<h2>Your iPhone Has a Life-Saving App</h2>
<p>So, how can your iPhone save your life? Well, it&rsquo;s all down to your Health app (the native Apple one with the small red heart on the icon). While most people probably use this app for fitness and health reasons, it has a far more important use.</p>
<p>Not sure what that is? Well, check out the Medical ID tab at the bottom of the main app menu. There you can enter vital information that&rsquo;s accessible by anyone in an emergency, and, according to one smart nurse, it might just be the key to keeping you safe.</p>

<p>"Working in a public hospital and seeing patients in ER all the time, I see many patients come in and we have had no way of knowing who they are, or how to contact their next of kin, or their medical history! And their phones are locked!&rdquo; Julia Thompson, a nurse, wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153055698026003&amp;set=a.439488021002.237037.703591002&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But many people don't realise that you can set up something called a 'Medical ID' on your iPhone if you have the Health app (free with phone).&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went onto explain that most people don&rsquo;t know how to use this app, or that it even exists. &ldquo;I didn't even realise this when I got my own iPhone!&rdquo; wrote Thompson. &ldquo;This information can be accessed even while the phone is locked by clicking on the emergency options and can display things like name, date of birth, emergency contacts, medical conditions and even blood type and donor status. You can even add notes!"</p>

<p>She finished her Facebook post dramatically, claiming Apple&rsquo;s Medical ID feature &lsquo;could save your life!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How to Stay Safe Using Medical ID</h2>
<p>So, now that you know just how vital the Health app could be, what are you waiting for? Setting it up with your information couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p>1) Open your Health app.</p>
<p>2) Tap the Medical ID tab in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>3) Click edit.</p>

<p>4) Fill in your medical information.</p>
<p>5) Turn on Show when locked.</p>
<p>6) Finally, tap Done.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve followed the above steps, you&rsquo;ll find that your emergency medical information is available even without your passcode. That means that anyone can see it so long as they have your iPhone. Genius!</p>
