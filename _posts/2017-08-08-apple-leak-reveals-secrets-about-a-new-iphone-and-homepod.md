<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This might be the most exciting iPhone 'leak' yet.</span></p>
<p>Apple has always been known for its tight-lipped nature regarding upcoming products. So, it came as a huge surprise when new rumours emerged, claiming Apple had <em>accidentally </em>uploading internal firmware (meant for employees&rsquo; eyes only!) to the internet. Whoops.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian, two developers, Steve Troughton-Smith and Guilherme Rambo, first noticed the leak. The firmware apparently revealed full details about the upcoming HomePod, and a few sneak previews of the rumoured 'iPhone 8' too, dubbed internally as 'D22'.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the internet has taken just a slight interest, with many analysing every inch of the firmware in hopes of figuring out what we can expect when HomePod and next iPhone launch. So, here are some of the most exciting rumours we&rsquo;ve heard so far.</p>
<h2>HomePod Rumours</h2>
<p>Before now, many presumed the HomePod wouldn&rsquo;t feature a display, much like other smart speakers on the market. Yet, web developer and Twitter user, Avery Magnotti, suggests that Apple&rsquo;s leak reveals a 272x340 screen as part of the design.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">HomePod has a &ldquo;screen&rdquo; of 272x340 and 1GB RAM cc <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith">@stroughtonsmith</a> <a href="https://t.co/IviOcwRY9n">pic.twitter.com/IviOcwRY9n</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, he claims that the HomePod will be packing 1GB RAM.</p>
<p>Magnotti also has a few ideas around HomePod&rsquo;s sound effects. He posted a video to his YouTube channel to share the alleged sounds.</p>

<h2>New iPhone Rumours</h2>
<p>While we&rsquo;re all jazzed about the HomePod, it&rsquo;s the next iPhone that we really want to know more about. We think Apple&rsquo;s next flagship phone will be announced in September, as it usually is, but the real insight from the firmware leak is into the design.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">But wait, there&rsquo;s more: images of the new iPhone form-factor are also present. &#x1f605; A lot of people at Apple are going to have a nasty Monday&hellip; <a href="https://t.co/BdmasKVVgI">https://t.co/BdmasKVVgI</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This week, iOS developer Guilherme Rambo shared an illustration of the "new iPhone form-factor" on Twitter. It may just look like an outline of a phone, but actually there could be more than meets the eye here.</p>
<p>One observation many have been quick to point out, is the complete lack of a Home Button. Could this be the proof that Apple is removing it completely on the next iPhone?</p>
<p>But wait&hellip; &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s no Home Button, how on earth will you unlock your new iPhone? Well, another source on Twitter, Steve T-S, claimed that 'iPhone 8' will have an &lsquo;infra-red face unlock in BiometricKit&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-8-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">>> iPhone 8 Rumours and Release Date</a></p>
<p>In other words, you might be able to unlock your iPhone simply by looking at it, thanks to built-in facial recognition.</p>
<p>What else can we deduce from the leaked iPhone image? It&rsquo;s fair to say that Apple is moving towards the bezel-less style that other smartphones are now flaunting, like Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">For the curious ones out there: this is the animation where that D22 glyph is used <a href="https://t.co/02KuEU974D">pic.twitter.com/02KuEU974D</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) <a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/894311620423405568">August 6, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had your fill of juicy Apple details yet, there&rsquo;s one more rumour to digest. Rambo also tweeted that the iPhone camera will sport a &lsquo;SmartCam&rsquo;, which can automatically adjust the camera settings to suit its surroundings.</p>
<p>While we can only speculate right now, it won&rsquo;t be long until the HomePod and new iPhone are available. Stay tuned for more.</p>
