<p><span class="postStandFirst">Family Guy looks set to appear on your smartphones, in a new, fun Family Guy mobile game. TV shows and movies that make it over into the mobile gaming world don't often enjoy much success, but that looks like it could change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3727/13222479904_a09133f058.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;TouchArcade, the next property to have a crack at a game is American cartoon&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>, and it will be coming soon to touchscreens all round the world.</p>
<p>Licensed by Fox, and produced by free-to-play experts TinyCo,&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;will feature an original story written by the show&rsquo;s writers, and as such, many people are already saying that the game&rsquo;s inspiration is obvious; in short, they&rsquo;re saying that the inception of this game might well have been influenced by the success of&nbsp;<em>South Park: The Stick Of Truth</em>&nbsp;on consoles and PC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no official word, yet, on when&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;will appear, but early indications suggest that the developers are looking at launching the game in April. At the same time, it&rsquo;s not been confirmed upon which platforms&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;will be released, but it&rsquo;s a safe bet that it will definitely appear on&nbsp;iOS devices&nbsp;like the&nbsp;iPhone 5c, and probably on Android devices like the upcoming&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2.</p>
<p>The only uncertain part is whether it will appear on Windows phones like the&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 1020, as developers sometimes tend to focus on the big two platforms first.</p>
<p><strong>Time will tell whether&nbsp;<em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;does indeed buck the &ldquo;licensed games are rubbish trend&rdquo;, but so far, things are looking hopeful! Expect more news as and when the game launches.</strong></p>
