<hr />
<p>Samsung is today announcing the Galaxy Note 7, bringing the popular Note series back to the UK.</p>
<p>Much to our grievance, Samsung decided against launching last year&rsquo;s Note 5 outside of the US (and a few other distant markets), but that won&rsquo;t be the case with the upcoming Note 7, which is the latest big Samsung smartphone.</p>
<p>Skipping the number <em>6</em> entirely &ndash; presumably to bring it in line with the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S7</a> &ndash; the Note 7 will drop in at the high-end of the market, with a large display, premium design and components to match. Not forgetting the Note series&rsquo; staple accessory &ndash; the S-Pen.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t take our word for it. Watch Samsung officially unveil the Note 7 via the live YouTube stream below.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Design</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need insider information to work out that the Note 7 is going to be big. The question is: <em>how</em> big? The general consensus seems to agree on a 5.7-inch display, matching the Galaxy Note 4 (and Note 5). Accompanied with an S-Pen, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of room to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Leaked images reveal that the Note 7 will likely flaunt a similar curved screen to that of the Galaxy S7 edge, no doubt with added functionality built into the sides. The shape looks a little squarer though, hitting a design that sits somewhere in the middle of the S7 edge and Note 5.</p>
<p>A number of sources are touting a water and dust-resistant build, which seems pretty likely seeing as the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Screen</h2>
<p>As stated above, the reports point to a 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 7, with a curve Quad HD display. It feels unlikely Samsung will opt for 4K, like the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, because it&rsquo;s totally unnecessary on a smartphone where the detail just isn&rsquo;t noticeable past a certain point.</p>
<p>Borrowing innovation from the LG G5, rumour has it that Galaxy Note 7 will feature an always-on screen, showcasing a snapshot of important details &ndash; like the time, date and your notifications &ndash; even when your device is on standby.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Camera</h2>
<p>The camera setup looks similar to the Galaxy S7, with the Note 7 tipped to house a 12-megapixel (main) and 5-megapixel (front) sensor. The primary camera may come complete with an infrared autofocus and large, f/1.4 aperture. In other words, expect fast and accurate focus, and bright photos.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Iris Scanner</h2>
<p>According TechRadar, it&rsquo;s looking &lsquo;very likely&rsquo; that the Note 7 will boast an eye-catching iris scanner.</p>
<p>Offering a novel take on the fingerprint scanner, this feature would in theory be able to unlock your mobile phone using your eyes as authorisation. It&rsquo;s something that ZTE and Microsoft have tried, and would no doubt serve as a fun party trick.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Battery</h2>
<p>OK, so it looks like battery size could be anyone&rsquo;s guess. We&rsquo;ve seen reports ranging from a modest 3000mAh, all the way up to a monstrous 4200mAh. Bearing in mind the large, QHD display and demanding processing power, you&rsquo;d expect Samsung to match in terms of juice. We expect to see something in the middle of the speculated sizes, around 3600mAh.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Power</h2>
<p>Power-hungry Android users will have to roll their tongues back in if the rumours are true. TechRadar has reported claims that the Note 7 could feature a Snapdragon 823 chip, which is so state-of-the-art it hasn&rsquo;t yet been announced.</p>
<p>Equally as impressive are reports suggesting anywhere up to 8GB of RAM. Like the speculation around a 4200mAh battery, this feels like wishful thinking. Note 7 is more likely to house 4GB RAM, or 6GB if we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Release Date</h2>
<p>The Note 7 is being announced today at 4pm, watch the event live using the stream at the top of this page. We haven&rsquo;t been given release dates yet, but we&rsquo;re predicating mid to late August.</p>
