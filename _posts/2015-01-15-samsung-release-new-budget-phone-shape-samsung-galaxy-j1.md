<p><span class="postStandFirst">Many people view the Moto G as the king of the budget phones, but Samsung is rumoured to have plans to try and usurp that device from its throne. According to new rumours, the device they plan on using to accomplish that is the Samsung Galaxy J1...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6196" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/01/Samsung-Galaxy-J1_thumb.jpg" alt="Samsung-Galaxy-J1_thumb" width="600" height="455" /><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung">Samsung</a> is well-known for making some of the best top-end smartphones on the market (the Samsung Galaxy S5 springs to mind, as does the truly epic Samsung Galaxy Note 4), but the company also makes rather nice mid-range and entry-level smartphones.</p>
<p>And now, according to <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2015/01/12/exclusive-here-are-the-first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-j1-sm-j100/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung is making a new one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said to be called the Samsung Galaxy J1, and according to the source link, it&rsquo;s being developed as a budget-priced rival to the likes of the Moto G. As you might expect, the rumoured specifications are distinctly entry-level, as the Galaxy J1 is rumoured to have a 1.2GHz processor (albeit a quad-core chip, that&rsquo;s said to be 64-bit), a 4.3-inch 480p display, 1GB of RAM, and a 5MP camera on the back. In terms of storage space, the Galaxy J1 is said to have 4GB of onboard storage, with a microSD slot so that users can expand that space, and fit more on the phone.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the phone is said to use Android KitKat.</p>
<p>The big question is whether it will be able to match the sheer brilliance of the Moto G, the handset that a lot of people use as their yardstick when comparing budget smartphones. The Galaxy J1 will of course have the added advantage of the Samsung brand, but it remains to be seen whether that can counter the sheer volume of cool stuff you get in the Motorola phone (a phone which, in the view of many, outclasses <em>every single </em>device in its price range).</p>
<p><strong>There is no firm indication over when the Samsung Galaxy J1 might be announced, but we&rsquo;d expect it to happen soon, so stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
