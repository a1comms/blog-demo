<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Say goodbye to those blobby faces.</span></p>
<p>While we already know that <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/android-o-features-possible-names-and-release-date" target="_blank">Android O</a> will bring a whole load of new features to the table, there&rsquo;s one teeny thing we just can&rsquo;t help getting hyped up about. Yes, Google will be totally redesigning all the Android emojis. Huzzah!</p>
<h2>Revamped Android Emoji</h2>
<p>Sure, the current emoji are acceptable, but it seems like they haven&rsquo;t had a makeover for years. When you compare them to iPhone emoji, they do look a tad old-fashioned and, someone has to say it, <em>blobby</em>. They just sort of spill out, all over the place.</p>
<p>Luckily, with the latest software update, Android users will be treated to a whole new roster of emoji, both redesigned and some that are 100% new to boot. The main differences you will notice here is the fact that the emoji are more refined. They have solid, circular outlines and honestly, look a whole load more like the emoji we&rsquo;re used to seeing elsewhere.</p>

<p>While there&rsquo;s no doubt that the old-school emoji were somewhat <em>unique</em>, there was one major problem with them. Yes, sometimes, it was simply unclear what they were actually purporting to be. Many an hour has been lost by people staring, somewhat confused, at these little icons, simply trying to figure out what they signify.</p>

<h2>New Emoji and Release Date</h2>
<p>So, what brand new emoji can you expect to see? Well, there are some exciting additions to the list. For example, the new dog emoji is actually a Shiba, which is quite possibly the most adorable thing you&rsquo;ll ever see in emoji form. There&rsquo;s also touted to be a new creepy clown icon, which will be ideal when you&rsquo;re trying to freak out your mates or, indeed, enemies.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re simply itching to try out these new Android emoji, there&rsquo;s some bad news. You&rsquo;ll likely have to wait until August or September, when the Android O update will be released. However, some users, like those who have the Google Pixel phone, can download the beta version today.</p>
<p>(Side note: The beta version may be a <em>little </em>buggy right now. The choice is yours!)</p>
