<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">All the Nokia-inspired nostalgia you could need.</span></p>
<p>Cast your mind back to the early 2000s, when tacky hair extensions were plentiful, someone somewhere still cared about Katie Price (aka Jordan), and Gareth Gates was the ultimate teen heartthrob. Needless to say, it was a slightly odd era. For the most part, anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one memory we can all look fondly back on, though, it&rsquo;s the classic phone of the early noughties - none other than the Nokia 3310.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have a Nokia 3310, you missed out <em>big time</em> on what became <em>the</em> era-defining experience for many of us. If you were lucky enough to own one, you know exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about: Snake 2, week-long batteries, an indestructible case. To name just a few.</p>
<p>See how many you remember, as we take a look back at some of the things that made owning a Nokia 3310 so memorable.</p>
<h2>1) You Spent Actual Money on Tiny Pixelated&nbsp;Pictures</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12896" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-screen-image.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough to merely have a 3310. Oh no, you had to take things to the very next level. It was <em>all </em>about having a funky image as your home screen. Remember forking out around &pound;1.50 for a grainy, black and white (well, green) picture? Those were the days!</p>

<h2>2) It Was Completely Unbreakable</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMXmhvzPiQI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It didn't matter how many times you dropped your Nokia 3310, how many times you flung it against a wall, or how many times you tried smashing it with a hammer, it just would not die.</p>
<p>Granted, Nokia 3310 didn&rsquo;t have all the modern-day features and apps we know and love now, but it was totally indestructible.</p>

<h2>3) You Could Compose Your Own Ringtones</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12894" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-customisable-ringtones.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="321" />If you wanted to be totally original, you could actually compose your own ringtone. Sure, this took up painstaking hours of time, but it was worth it. You would have fun&nbsp;trying to create a unique sound for your phone, and eventually beg your mates to call you, wasting 10p of credit, so you could show off the fruits of your labour.</p>

<h2>4) You Had to Delete Texts to Free up Space</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12897" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-sms.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="374" /></p>
<p>One of the only drawbacks of the Nokia 3310 was the low storage space. It meant you really couldn&rsquo;t keep more than a handful of text messages at any one time, or risk not receiving any new ones. Everyone who had one of these phones remembers having to periodically sweep through and delete old messages.</p>

<h2>5) A New Case Was Basically a New Phone</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12898" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/naughties-phone-cases-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>After you had saved up your pocket money for a few weeks in a row, you could finally afford a brand new phone case. From Pop Idol to Winnie the Pooh, there were loads of rad designs from which to choose. You&rsquo;d spend days fantasising about which case you were going to buy and couldn&rsquo;t wait to show the beauty off at school.</p>

<h2>6) The Unlock System Was Easy to Master</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12899" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-keypad.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336" /></p>
<p>Do you remember how you used to unlock these phones? It was actually ridiculously easy. You simply pressed the home button and the star key, and voila! It really was that simple. At the time, though, we all thought that it was majorly high tech.</p>

<h2>7) You Had a Worrying Addiction to Snake 2</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12900" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/Snake-GIF.gif" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Looking back, Snake 2 is pretty much one of the most basic games ever. Still, back in the early 2000s, you were obsessed with this crazily addictive mobile game. Getting the highest score possible would make you a legend, and so you didn&rsquo;t really go a day without tackling it.</p>

<h2>8) It Was an Emergency Bottle Opener</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Jlzj8jhLTk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s no doubt that this classic phone was pretty sturdy. The minute we all figured out that we could actually open beer bottles with the side of the Nokia 3310, our lives were never quite the same again. Or as sober.</p>

<h2>9) The Battery Seemed to Last Forever</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12901" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-battery.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="366" /></p>
<p>You could charge your phone on a Sunday night, use it all week, and still have a full battery come Friday evening. Right now, that might seem like a fairy tale, but it&rsquo;s (almost) true. You can look back and laugh at its features, but don&rsquo;t you say a thing about its battery life.</p>

<h2>10) Looking for Free Ringtones, Not Apps</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6RL8Une8Ac" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you wanted a specific tune for your phone, it wasn&rsquo;t all that hard. You could even get &lsquo;cheat sheets&rsquo; that taught you how to compose certain tunes. Usually, you&rsquo;d find these in the back of magazines or even&hellip; *gasp*&hellip;. online. Oh, hello EastEnders theme song!</p>

<h2>11) You Could Write Super Long Texts</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12903" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/text-messages-nokia-3310.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>One of the BEST things about having a 3310 was the fact that you could write longer texts than any of your friends. The phone let you run three messages together, which meant you got a whopping 459 characters. It was kind of a big deal at the time.</p>

<h2>12) The Charger Got Hotter Than Hot</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12904" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/Man-sets-fire-to-indestructible-Nokia-3310.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, you basically only had to charge your phone once a week, which was ace. Still, there is one thing that we all remember about doing so. If you ever touched the charger while it was fuelling your Nokia 3310, you&rsquo;ll recall it was worryingly warm. Not Note-7-level warm, but still.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>13) T9 Predictive Text Was the Bane of Your Life</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12905" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/predictive-texting-nokia-3310.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you needed to send a super-quick text to your gal pal about a cute guy you just saw in the corridor. It wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it may sound now. Using T9 predictive texting was tricky to say the least. If you wanted to get every word right, this thing took some time.</p>

<h2>14) You Could Only Have 250 Friends</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12906" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/sherlock-i-dont-have-friends.gif" width="600" height="348" /></p>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know anyone with more than 250 real friends. Facebook doesn&rsquo;t really count. But, if you were the kind of person with thousands of pals, the Nokia 3310 was not one of them. You could only save 250 contacts in this phone.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>15) You Dabbled in the Other Nokia Games</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12902" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-3310-games.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>While nothing could compete with the likes of Snake 2, you often dabbled in the other games. You know, just for a change. From Space Impact to Pairs II, there were a few handy extra games on the Nokia 3310.</p>
<p>What memories do you have of the Nokia 3310? Leave a comment below.</p>
