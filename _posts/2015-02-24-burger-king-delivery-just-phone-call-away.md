<p><span class="postStandFirst">Burger King has announced a new home delivery service that&rsquo;s slowly being rolled out across the UK. Hungry customers can place their order through Burger King&rsquo;s website or over the phone. But will this service be built into the app, too?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6264 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/BK-1024x612.png" alt="Burger King Delivery" width="960" height="573" /></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat a good burger, or so they say, and Burger King is about to make it even easier to get one. In fact, they&rsquo;re about to make it so that you don&rsquo;t even need to leave your house to get one.</p>
<p>The fast food giant is bringing home delivery to the UK, allowing you to place an order through their <a href="http://burgerkingdelivers.co.uk/#!/home">website</a> (or over the phone), and have it delivered straight to your door!</p>
<p>Of course, there are some limitations to the service for now, not least the fact that it&rsquo;s only been rolled out in a select handful of locations across the UK, so far; those locations are Romford, Truro, Hornchurch, Skegness, Hull, Northampton, Hayes and Gants Hill. However, if the service is successful there, it will only be a matter of time until it rolls out across more UK locations.</p>
<p>And the people seem to be lovin' it.</p>

<p>Well, most people, anyway...</p>

Burger King is trialling home delivery. Now you don't even have to walk to a counter to get fat. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fatndback?src=hash">#fatndback</a></p>

<p>The Burger King Delivers website is of course available through a mobile browser, so whether you&rsquo;re using Samsung Galaxy S5, the mighty LG G3 or the wildly popular iPhone 6, you should be able to order your burger through your phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no indication, yet, of whether the service will be included in BK&rsquo;s smartphone app (available on both Google Play and iTunes), but many suspect this is the next logical step for the fast food giant to take, once the service is rolled out in more locations.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you like BK&rsquo;s burgers, then it&rsquo;s about to get even easier for you to order your dinner!</strong></p>
