<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple is busy completing the final preparations in time for its highly anticipated iPhone event, which is set to begin in just 24 hours&rsquo; time. As the Internet is awash with innumerable and conflicting rumours, what can we actually expect to see?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5086 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-08-at-17.59.04-1024x515.png" alt="Apple Event - iPhone 6" width="960" height="482" /><span class="caption">Image: 24 hours to go until Apple's 'special event', courtesy of apple.com</span></p>
<p>For those who are blissfully unaware, the next 24 hours will probably pass by just as the previous 24 did &ndash; completely humdrum and uneventful. Yet, for Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and the millions of tech junkies around the world, you can imagine that the next 24 hours will be playing out like a series of the US drama &lsquo;24&rsquo; &ndash; exhausting, somewhat drawn-out, but, at times, exhilarating. Today, of course, marks the eve of Apple&rsquo;s iPhone event.</p>
<p>So, with just one more day to go until Apple finally dams the perpetual stream of questions and rumours flowing through the Web, with its official introduction of what is being dubbed as &lsquo;iPhone 6&rsquo;, we think it&rsquo;s time to wade through it all and fish out only the most plausible speculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that none of the information contained in this &lsquo;iPhone 6&rsquo; report has been substantiated by Apple in any way, and is, in fact, based purely upon rumour.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>It seems fitting to start with what is undoubtedly the most common (and therefore most valid?) rumour that has been repeated time and time again, and that is that Apple will be releasing a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch iPhone 6. This will mark a significant increase from the 4-inch screen found on iPhone 5s, and should allow Apple to compete with larger Android and Windows Phone devices.</p>
<p>Despite an apparent increase in size, both variations of iPhone 6 are said to be thinner than iPhone 5s, which is 7.6mm thick. The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will supposedly measure at 138mm (length) x 66mm (width) x 6.9mm (depth), whilst the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will have a larger frame at 158mm x 78mm x 7.1mm.</p>
<p>Leaked images that purport to reveal the design of iPhone 6 indicate that it will have a much softer look and feel, with chamfered edges. Whilst the bezels don&rsquo;t really consume much space on the front of iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, they should be even narrower on iPhone 6, allowing for more screen space.</p>
<p>The power button, which sits on the top of iPhone 5s, seems to have been relocated to the right-hand side of it, for better one-handed use.</p>
<p>The volume rockers look as though they&rsquo;ve been revised, taking on a longer, pill-shaped design. The mute switch will likely be positioned just above the volume rockers, as is the case on last year&rsquo;s models.</p>
<p>The camera appears to have been positioned in the upper left corner of the rear shell again. Some sources are claiming that the lens itself protrudes slightly from the handset, which could suggest a couple of things &ndash; but we&rsquo;ll get on to that later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5084 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-5s-Gold.jpeg" alt="iPhone 5s and iPhone 6" width="459" height="370" /><span class="caption">Image: A size comparison of what the iPhone 6 might look like, next to the iPhone 5s.</span></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, most sources seem to agree that the display on iPhone 6 will inevitably be taking on a larger size. Yet, fewer sources seem to be able to agree on the resolution of the two different iPhone 6 sizes. It&rsquo;s possible that the 4.7-inch model will feature a resolution of 1472 x 828, and the grander 5.5-inch one may sport a screen with a resolution of 1704 x 960.</p>
<p>Not only is Apple allegedly changing the size of the iPhone display, but also the composition. A vast amount of speculation claims that the iPhone 6 will come equipped with a display that has been fashioned from a blend of glass and sapphire, for increased durability and scratch-resistance. We&rsquo;re positive that this is something that any iPhone user would welcome with open arms. So fingers crossed, it comes to fruition.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Naturally, iPhone 6 will boast considerably enhanced internal components over iPhone 5s. Rumours suggest that we&rsquo;ll be seeing an A8 chipset, which will be smaller, faster and more energy efficient than its precursor (the A7). The A8 could compose of four core processors, each clocking in at 2GHz. We expect Apple to up the ante on RAM, increasing it from 1GB to 2GB.</p>
<p>There are some sources claiming that the larger of the two iPhones will flaunt an impressive 128GB of internal storage, which would of course be a first for Apple&rsquo;s popular range of smartphones.</p>
<p>In terms of their power source, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will apparently pack a 1,810mAh battery, whereas the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 looks like it may have a larger 2,915mAh battery fitted into it. Whether these sizes are precise or not, its inevitable that the bigger of the two iPhones will have a larger battery to match it&rsquo;s size.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The camera unit on iPhone 6 will assuredly offer an improvement to the one you&rsquo;ll find on iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. Reports claim that it will feature a 13-megapixel shooter, with Optical Image Stabilisation to counter-balance shaky hands, thereby producing stiller and smoother results. Smartphones like LG G3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4 boast the same technology.</p>
<p>I briefly touched upon the protruding camera lens earlier, which could really be a result of two different things, providing that it&rsquo;s true in the first place.</p>
<p>The first possibility, and certainly the more exciting of the two, is that the iPhone could feature an optical zoom that would enable users to zero in on their subject with higher proximity, without distorting or pixelating the shot.</p>
<p>The second possibility may be that the alleged narrowness of the iPhone 6 can&rsquo;t accommodate a camera lens as advanced as Apple may want it to be, and remain flush to the surface of the device.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that we&rsquo;ll be seeing Touch ID on this year&rsquo;s iPhones. It&rsquo;s been a tremendously effective tool for iPhone users since its introduction on iPhone 5s last year, and would seem senseless not to include it again.</p>
<p>Touch ID, if you&rsquo;re not already aware, is an intelligent feature that&rsquo;s&nbsp;artfully integrated into the home button on iPhone 5s,&nbsp;and it&nbsp;allows you to use your fingerprint as a passcode, as well as authorising purchases from iTunes, the App Store and the iBooks store. So not only does it increase your iPhone&rsquo;s level of security, it also eliminates the hassle of prodding in a password every time you download something from Apple.</p>
<p>Touch ID, or rather the technology behind it, has since appeared on other smartphones like Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and HTC One Max, which goes to show just how desirable a feature it is.</p>
<p>Apple has notably chosen not to incorporate Near Field Communication (NFC) in its iPhones over the years. This could well be about to change with rumours suggesting that NFC integration is essential for Apple&rsquo;s forthcoming mobile payment feature. NFC allows one-touch, wireless connectivity with other NFC enabled devices. So, in theory, if Apple was to integrate it into its iPhone 6, users may be able to pay for purchases with their device.</p>
<p>What else? Well, iPhone 6 is said to have an atmospheric sensor built into it, in order to measure weather trends and altitude data. Additionally, some sources claim that it will feature temperature, humidity and barometric sensors too.</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t catch it earlier, Apple will be hosting its &lsquo;special event&rsquo; on 9/9/14 at 6pm GMT (10am PDT). Apple is live streaming it from its website. You can also follow all of the action from our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuyMobiles">Facebook</a> and Twitter pages.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no clear-cut date as to when we will have the iPhone 6 in stock, but we'll be brining you updates when we know more.</strong></p>
