<p><span class="postStandFirst">Caterpillar, the world&rsquo;s biggest construction and mining equipment manufacturer, has brought a super tough smartphone to the market in the form of the Cat B15.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.komputerswiat.pl/media/2013/57/2834903/cat.jpg" width="620" height="400" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The B15 is one solid phone, built to keep working in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>Manufactured from anodized aluminium and rubber, the B15 is not only practical but also quite a looker. The device has IP67-certification meaning that it&rsquo;s both dustproof and waterproof, and even features wet-finger tracking technology.</p>
<p>The device boasts a 4 inch multi-touch display and is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor and 512MB of RAM, coupled with Android Jellybean 4.1 straight from the box, which means the device offers zippy functionality.</p>
<p>The Cat B15 smartphone houses a 5 megapixel camera, with 720p video recording, which allows you to capture all the action in stills and movies. All those photos and videos can be stored on the 4GB internal memory which can be expanded to 32GB via the built in microSD card reader.</p>
<p>To keep the B15 going Cat has included a whopping 2000mAh battery that has a standby of up to 28 days.</p>
<p><strong>The Cat B15 is a seriously tough phone, built to work in the hardest environments without scrimping on features or functionality. Simply put this smartphone has the perfect balance of technology and durability.</strong></p>
