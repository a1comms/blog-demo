<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. iOS 11 is a huge hit. If you&rsquo;ve yet to upgrade to it on your iPhone or iPad, now is the time.</p>
<p>Aside from the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new features that iOS 11 offers</a>, there&rsquo;s yet another treat in store for us all. Yes, Apple users can now get over 70 brand new emoji, many of which were previously announced as part of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/celebrate-world-emoji-day-with-these-200-new-emoji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Emoji Day</a> back in July.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what new emoji are now on iPhone and iPad with iOS 11.1. From sign language emoji, to more food than any of us can really handle, here&rsquo;s what you can get from the very latest batch!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15176" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hRuCVadFpl1h6IHlMRrw3voO2hVRqbJcj0vMi_B2NUGIFankKKUfudaBK82IjjkzY2GEf55R8TGxOJ3R1qq9nkk=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>A Big Step Towards Inclusivity</h2>
<p>One of the most progressive and exciting things about the latest iOS emoji update is the fact that they&rsquo;re way more inclusive than ever before. For example, the latest set of emoji will include a woman wearing a hijab, as well as a gender-neutral person too. There&rsquo;s also an American sign language emoji for the phrase <em>I love you</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15177" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kMoloZHaEsaB2TA8j_0uR8mvLdfY4bWVJ0aKFfyKA_BnZJIThDwRMHaYPXhebM3J1YPT1X6NftQYqzdyLHNo390=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Previously, Apple had come under fire for failing to accurately represent the wider population. This is, of course, a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Food, Glorious Food!</h2>
<p>Of course, everyone&rsquo;s favourite topic of conversation is food. When we&rsquo;re not snapping pictures of our plates and Instagramming (yes, it&rsquo;s a verb now) it, we&rsquo;re thinking about it.</p>
<p>Luckily, as part of the newest emoji update on iOS 11.1, we&rsquo;re getting a whole load of new foodie icons. Highlights include a piece of broccoli, a pie, some dumplings, and even a coconut. Soon, you&rsquo;ll have even less need of typing out food-related words, because there&rsquo;s going to be an emoji for almost every dish.</p>

<h2>More Creative Smileys Than Ever</h2>
<p>Did you realise that up until this update, we didn&rsquo;t have an emoji to tell friends to shush? It&rsquo;s been a big issue. Imagine you tell your bestie a big secret but don&rsquo;t want them to spread the gossip around town. What to do?</p>
<p>Before now, you&rsquo;d have get the point across with actual words. Thankfully, those days are over. The new <em>shush</em> emoji is the answer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15179" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W5nPu5b8zJ9NOWQnTr9W-FFdcHitTobtaJrsmJ1KVEmBK8ZzXy7lliONo2atmmiz7sywxxe006_Ax2UMsMlLlZMEEw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only new smiley Apple has released. iOS 11.1 also has a swearing emoji, an inquisitive face, and a hilariously weird face to boot. What more could you possibly want?</p>
<h2>When is iOS 11.1 Available?</h2>
<p>Right now! The new iOS 11.1 update was released on 1 November, and is already rolling out to iPhone around the world. To download it for your compatible iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
