<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Ask yourself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last thing I do before going to sleep?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>For most us, it&rsquo;s probably browsing our smartphones. Almost ritually, it tends to be the first thing we do in the morning and the last thing we do at night. Depending on your relationship status, perhaps.</p>
<p>The issue is, we don&rsquo;t really stop scrolling to consider how this behaviour might be affecting us&hellip;</p>
<p>According to Apple (and other <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/blue-light-from-electronics-disturbs-sleep-especially-for-teenagers/2014/08/29/3edd2726-27a7-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sources</a>), studies have shown that evening exposure to the type of blue light emitted by our smartphones and tablets can disrupt our sleep cycle, leaving us feeling sluggish the following day.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s where Night Shift comes in. While Apple doesn&rsquo;t make any promises, it&rsquo;s heavily inferred that this feature could be the long-awaited answer to our sleep-deprived nights. Or at least those that&rsquo;re caused by your late-night Instagram&nbsp;binges.</p>
<p>Before I reveal more about Night Shift, I&rsquo;ll first explain a little about how sleeping works. Or at least the process leading up to it.</p>
<h2>Heavy Eyelids</h2>
<p>As we approach our usual bedtime, the pineal gland in our brain begins to produce lovely, lovely melatonin, a hormone that helps reduce alertness and starts luring us to sleep.</p>
<p>Light, however, and particularly the long-wave blue kind, can prevent our pineal gland from doing its job, by producing histamine. The effect is feeling more awake for longer, and therefore&nbsp;struggle to nod off.</p>
<p>This is bad, because we really need sleep. We love it for a reason; it&rsquo;s our body&rsquo;s respite, a chance to heal and repair itself, so we feel physically and mentally stable when we wake up... Or so we&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<h2>Night Shift: The Cure?</h2>
<p>One obvious solution to ensuring a better night&rsquo;s sleep, is putting your gadgets down at least an hour before bed. In Night Shift, though, it looks like Apple is offering a way for you to continue using your smartphone up until you want to snooze, without the usual detriment to your sleep quality.</p>
<p>It does this by adjusting your display colours to the warmer end of the spectrum, producing a diluted orange glow that&rsquo;s much easier on the eyes. In doing so, the level of blue light is diminished.</p>
<p>Night Shift works with your iOS device&rsquo;s clock and geolocation, which allows you to either set a custom schedule for switching it on (and off, in the morning), or to coordinate it with the sunset and sunrise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Night Shift for about a month. Whilst I can&rsquo;t back it up with any data or evidence, I have&nbsp;noticed a difference in how my body reacts to the colour of my iPhone display. My eyes are much less strained and I do feel the oncome of sleep sooner than before. Then again, I try to avoid any electronics past 9:30PM.</p>
<h2>How to Set Up Night Shift</h2>
<p>First of all, make sure you're running the latest version of iOS, by going to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>General</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> > <strong>Night Shift</strong>, and there you can configure when it engages on your smartphone. You can set Night Shift to a time schedule, or have it kick in and fade out with the sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p>On a related note, in iOS 10 and later, &nbsp;Apple has blacked out the alarm background within the clock app. It's much easier on your eyes, especially in a dark room. You'll also see the new Bedtime tab, which helps you keep to a strict sleep schedule.</p>
