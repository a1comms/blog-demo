<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sporting a great balance of looks and functionality, the Optimus L5 II is the perfect mid-range smartphone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/lg_optimus_l5ii.jpg" width="158" height="303" /></p>
<p>The&nbsp;LGOptimus L5 II&nbsp;is a great little smartphone, being snappy, light and attractive. Offering Jelly Bean goodness straight from the box, the Optimus L5 II has some great features for one so compact.</p>
<p>The front of the handset is taken up with an ample 4 inch IPS display which has vibrant colours and viewing angles. The handset is also very slim at just over 9mm thick, bringing it bang up-to-date in the style stakes.</p>
<p>On the rear of the device is a 5 megapixel camera with an LED flash, nothing unusual there however one of the more interesting features in the camera software window is the inclusion of LG's exclusive 'cheese shutter.' This allows the user to take a picture using voice commands to ensure that the perfect moment is never missed again!</p>
<p>Powering the device is a single 1GHz processor which, coupled with Android Jelly Bean, is surprisingly zippy and responsive. LG has included some unique software with new features, one such being the inclusion of Quick Memo, which gives the ability to write or draw on the screen which then is saved in the gallery. It is great for address information, phone numbers or just making a quick note.</p>
<p>The Optimus L5 II has 4GB of storage, with the ability to expand up to 32GB via microSD support, so there is plenty of room for your apps, downloads, movies, games and music. The handset also houses a 1700mAh battery that will offer plenty of juice for everyday use.</p>
<p><strong>LG has created a very attractive and feature-packed handset in the Optimus L5 II and, in a market where there is very little offering the same specs in a mid-range smartphone, LG should reign supreme with this device.</strong></p>
