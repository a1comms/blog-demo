<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony&rsquo;s Remote Play service is perhaps one of the most exciting parts about owning a smartphone like the Sony Xperia Z3, but what <i>is</i> Sony Remote Play, and how does it work? Join us as we take a look at the service, and see just why it has so many people excited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6032" alt="Remote Play" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Remote-Play-1024x795.png" width="672" height="522" /></p>
<p>We always love to see it when new features turn up on smartphones, especially when it&rsquo;s a feature that we&rsquo;ve never seen before. There&rsquo;s the UV sensor in the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the Healthkit health app integration in the iPhone 6...</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s Remote Play, on Sony&rsquo;s current crop of <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Xperia smartphones</a>, a feature that&rsquo;s aimed squarely at one particular segment of the market.</p>
<p>Gamers.</p>
<p>But what <i>is</i> Remote Play? How does it work, and what phone will you need to actually use this rather awesome new feature? Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>What is Sony Remote Play?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-6034 aligncenter" alt="2Coloumn_module2_SonyXperia_vf1" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/2Coloumn_module2_SonyXperia_vf1.png" width="664" height="473" /></p>
<p>Quite simply, Remote Play is a whole new way to play games on your Sony smartphone, or to put it in more accurate (and more <i>awesome-sounding</i>) terms, a way for you to play <i>PlayStation 4</i> games on your Sony smartphone. In essence it is, as per the name, a remote gaming experience, one that&rsquo;s broadly similar to the online service OnLive, except that instead of connecting to gaming servers somewhere in the rest of the world, it connects up to the PS4 in your own living room.</p>
<p>Naturally, though, this does mean that you&rsquo;ll also need a PS4 to use Remote Play...</p>
<p>And so, as incredible as it sounds, what Remote Play does is let you play compatible PS4 games (Sony&rsquo;s own site for the service shows <i>Drive Club</i> and <i>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed IV: Black Flag</i> as working with the service) in the palm of your hand, seamlessly switching from playing them on the big TV to playing them on your smartphone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really kind of mind-blowing, when you think about it!</p>
<h2>How does Sony Remote Play work?</h2>
<p>Sony has gone to great lengths to ensure that the Remote Play service is a doddle to use, and the setup process can be best described as:</p>
<p><i>1/ Connect your Xperia phone to WiFi at home. </i></p>
<p><i>2/ Link your phone to your PS4. </i></p>
<p><i>3/ Play stuff. </i></p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done (you&rsquo;re essentially setting up a <i>home network</i> between the two devices), you can use your Xperia phone as a sort of remote game controller, one that has a built-in screen (and of course, PlayStation 4 controllers can be linked up to the phone, to play games <i>properly</i>). The phone sends your button presses to the PS4, and the PS4 streams the video and audio back to your phone, and the end result is, quite simply, PS4 gaming anywhere in the house, even when you&rsquo;re not sat in front of the telly!</p>
<h2>What do you need to use Sony Remote Play?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6033" alt="2Coloumn_module1_IntroducingPSTV_vf1" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/2Coloumn_module1_IntroducingPSTV_vf1.png" width="664" height="473" />Remote Play is, as you might expect, a service that&rsquo;s exclusive to Sony phones, so don&rsquo;t go expecting to try this out on something like the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s exclusive to their <i>recent </i>Xperia phones, so you&rsquo;ll need a Sony Xperia Z3, a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, or a Z2 series phone (or tablet).</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, you&rsquo;ll need a PS4, and a reliable WiFi connection.</p>
<p><b>So, grab yourself those things, and you too can play PS4 games on your smartphone!</b></p>
