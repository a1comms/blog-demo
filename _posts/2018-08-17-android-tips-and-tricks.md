<p>Need to make a call without picking up your phone? It couldn&rsquo;t be easier. One of the most useful Android hacks is the hands-free calling feature.</p>
<p>First, you need to make sure that Voice Detection is switched on. Go to Settings > Voice > &lsquo;OK Google&rsquo; detection. When you&rsquo;ve done that, you can call anyone by saying &ldquo;OK Google, call <insert name>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>2) Check the Weather On the Go</h2>
<p>Planning a picnic? Want up-to-date weather notifications on your phone? You can get a five-day forecast with Now Cards in the Google app.</p>
<p>Head to Settings > Search &amp; Now > Now Cards > Show Cards. When you&rsquo;ve done all of that, you just need to follow the instructions to complete the setup.</p>
<h2>3) Match Your Music to Your Mood</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working late or rocking out, there&rsquo;s sure to be a playlist that suits your mood. When it comes to awesome Android tips, you can&rsquo;t go far wrong here.</p>
<p>Simply, go to the Google Play Music app and select an option that matches your feelings or what you&rsquo;re doing right now. The app will find you a radio station that instantly matches your mood in mere seconds. Happy listening!</p>
<h2>4) Make Your Battery Last Longer</h2>

<p>Running out of juice can be a real nightmare. If you see your battery getting low, head to Settings > Battery > Battery Saver. Switch the feature on at the top left side of your screen.</p>
<p>You can also make sure that it comes on automatically by clicking &lsquo;Turn on automatically&rsquo; and choosing either &lsquo;at 5% battery&rsquo; or &lsquo;at 15% battery.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>5) Create Your Own Android Character</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18295" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TIGTSYGa_Lppqxf6Aq2JGIDfEIrz-A9yut65jB7b_dAQTqU5d6puAVDssQ8cL4rImSAIA-a3pBp1K9O-d469hvI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fancy making a quirky little character of yourself? It couldn&rsquo;t be easier! Note: You should make sure that you have the Androidify app on your mobile (or download it from the Play Store) before you try this one.</p>
<p>Next, open the app and have some fun designing a character that looks just like you. You can tailor your look to match certain traits like your hair style, eye colour, and so on. Alternately, you could always make an Android character for a friend or loved one.</p>
<p><strong>>> Download Androidify for free on Google Play</strong></p>
<h2>6) Talk to Your Calendar</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a busy person that&rsquo;s always on the go, this is one of the best Android tips for you. Make sure that you have OK Google Voice Detection on first. If you have, you can start talking to your calendar and scheduling your time.</p>
<p>You can say things like &ldquo;OK Google, remind me to call Mum at 8pm&rdquo; or &ldquo;OK Google, set an alarm for 6am.&rdquo; These plans will be automatically added to your calendar (and you&rsquo;ll feel like a total boss!).</p>
<h2>7) Find the Right Picture Pronto</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18293" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tfTvVRacPKHC9blYlmJ-gr2jZmFW1M-XGRLL7dcz5jF5IurVyGCBPjJuZW3eRlX5t87WVVHHG8t2SUBNTAHhFSOA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you have the Google Photos app, there are a few Android tips and tricks you need to know. For example, you can search your pictures by the people in them, where they were taken, and what object is in them.</p>
<p>First, make sure that you have the version 1.23 of the app or below. When you open the app, you should see a blue search button. Press it. Type in the name, place, or object that you&rsquo;re looking for and search. You could try &ldquo;York, UK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cats&rdquo; and see what you find.</p>
<h2>8) Text Using Your Microphone</h2>
<p>Who has the time to sit around typing out texts? It&rsquo;s 2018&hellip; We&rsquo;re all busy people these days. Again, you will need to make sure that OK Google Voice Detection is on before you try this one out (unless you want to look quite silly!).</p>
<p>Say &ldquo;OK Google&rdquo; and then who you want to text and what you want to say. For example, you could say &ldquo;OK Google, text Matt that I&rsquo;m on my way and will be there in five!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>9) Share a Calendar with Your Besties</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re planning a girly holiday or trying to schedule a meeting with colleagues, a shared calendar goes a long, long way. Luckily, there are some Android tips to help you with this task. Head to the &lsquo;My Calendars&rsquo; tab and click &lsquo;Create new calendar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You'll need to take a minute to set up some of the basics including the calendar name, what it&rsquo;s all about, and what time zone you&rsquo;re working with. Finally, you can share your calendar with your contacts (so long as they have Gmail) so everyone can see it.</p>
<h2>10) Find Your Torch (when you need it!)</h2>

<p>Suddenly in the middle of a power cut? Nightmare. The last thing you have time to do is search through your Android device to find the torch feature. Luckily, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Swipe down from the top of the screen and open Quick Settings. You should see the torch icon there which you can tap to open. Crisis averted.</p>
