<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">What is the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition and why should you care?</span></p>
<p>Looking for a new device this festive season? The <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/reviews/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-oneplus-6t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 6T</a> is a pretty darn remarkable phone. Packing a built-in fingerprint sensor, an incredible camera setup, an epic 6.41-inch display with 2340&times;1080 resolution, and Full Screen Gesture 2.0, there&rsquo;s a whole load to love here.</p>
<p>But, what if we told you things were about to get better? Yes, the company is released a special McLaren Edition of the phone. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>1) Bigger RAM</h2>
<p>One of the biggest differences with the McLaren Edition and the standard phone comes down to RAM size. In this case, bigger is very much better. While the normal phone has either a 6GB or 8GB RAM offering, this special edition device comes with a whopping 10GB RAM. That means that it&rsquo;s ultimately a much faster phone when you&rsquo;re using it. Nice.</p>

<h2>2) Better Design</h2>
<p>If you love McLaren&rsquo;s cars, you&rsquo;re going to fall head over heels in love with the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition. The phone encapsulates all that is great about the vehicles and wraps it up into one neat little package.</p>
<p>The overall look of the phone screams industrial and high-quality, making it one of the coolest looking devices we&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. The Papaya Orange speed trail, which you find on their vehicles, is also here too. Along the bottom of the phone, you will find the signature look.</p>
<h2>3) Faster Charging</h2>
<p>But wait, what about juicing the device up? The standard OnePlus 6T doesn&rsquo;t fall short. You&rsquo;ve got the a 3700 mAh battery here and Fast Charge, which means that you can get plenty of power in just 30 minutes. However, the McLaren Edition takes things to a whole new level. This time around, you get something called Warp Charge 30, which means that you can get a day's worth of charge in just 20 minutes. Speedy.</p>
<h2>4) Racing Heritage</h2>
<p>Flip the McLaren device over and you&rsquo;ll see something very interesting indeed. The device sports a snazzy carbon fiber pattern. It&rsquo;s not just about looks, either. This material has historic value for the McLaren company as they were the first to use it on its Formula 1 vehicles. The patterned back is a homage to that fact and, besides that, looks awesome too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
