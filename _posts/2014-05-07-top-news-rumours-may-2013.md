<p><span class="postStandFirst">All the latest rumours from the world of smartphones.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Nexus 5</strong></h2>
<p>With google 1/0 just around the corner, news of the latest Nexus device has been surfacing again, but is the Nexus 5 to be created by the Korean firm this time? A recent leak of a new mystery LG handset has also added fuel to the fire and, if the rumoured specs are accurate, we could be looking at the most powerful handset to ever hit the market. It is believed that the Nexus 5 will be powered by a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 3GB of RAM, a 16 megapixel camera and even 4K video recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>HTC One</strong></h2>
<p>With the amazing HTC One now available in more and more countries, the Taiwanese manufacturer has released an update in the form of 1.29.206.11, the new software brings in all manners of improvements to the device, such as improved picture quality and better battery life. HTC is hard at work to release Android 4.2.2 onto the flagship and it has become recent knowledge that the HTC One would be the first phone (outside of the Nexus devices) to get the upcoming Jelly Bean 4.3.</p>

<h2><strong>Nokia Lumia 928</strong></h2>
<p>Following on from the success of the Lumia range, Nokia is to host a Lumia event on the 14 May. There have been recent rumours, coupled with a picture on the Nokia website, relating to a new Windows Phone 8 flagship in the form of the Nokia Lumia 928. Not much is known about the device but one thing that can be expected is a drastic improvement to the existing camera. The Lumia 920, Nokia's current WP8 flagship, already has the Finnish firm's patented PureView technology incorporated into the device resulting in some phenomenal photo capture, and the Lumia 928 is believed to take this to the next level.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<strong>Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom</strong></h2>
<p>Samsung is believed to be working on a new Galaxy camera phone, said to be carrying a 16 megapixel camera and to be following a similar design to the latest flagship device, the Galaxy S4. Believed to be image-focused, the Galaxy S4 Zoom will ship with a slightly lower spec than that of the Galaxy S4, this being to save on price for the consumers. The Zoom is expected to be available sometime in June/ July.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<strong>LG smartphones</strong></h2>
<p>LG has released its Android Jelly Bean 4.1 update for all its current models, including the excellent LG Optimus 4X HD, the update brings plenty of new features to the table and improves on performance all round, making the platform much smoother and more responsive. The update is available via O.T.A or from LG update software.</p>
