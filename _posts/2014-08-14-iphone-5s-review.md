<p><span class="postStandFirst">iPhone 5s represents the pinnacle of Apple&rsquo;s mobile phone range thus far, with blazing-fast internal components and a flawless metal design. Join us as we put it through its paces, and discover what&rsquo;s driving its overwhelming popularity.</span></p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re all aware, Apple boasts a pretty impressive reputation, and by extension, so does its iPhone range. Ever since the first generation iPhone launched, all the way back in 2007, the spotlight has been well and truly fixed on the company from Cupertino, California.</p>
<p>But what is it about iPhones that seems to cause so much commotion? What happens when we scrape away the masterful PR and the strategic advertising campaigns? What are we really left with? Let&rsquo;s find out, through a closer inspection of iPhone 5s.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no denying it, iPhone 5s is something special. Its alluring, metal body really is a thing of beauty, and, just as a premium phone should, it looks and feels sumptuous.</p>
<p>The chamfered corners of iPhone 5s contribute to its effortless beauty and curvaceous design, the glass panel front delivers a glossy finish and the buttons seem to be perfectly designed and placed, without spoiling the seamlessness of the design.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7019 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14730137717_882f75d68a_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s design" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p>In truth,&nbsp;iPhone 5s is one sexy smartphone.</p>
<p>And for the first time in Apple&rsquo;s history, we&rsquo;re seeing a gold iPhone, which is closer to pastel champagne, rather than a traditional, ostentatious&nbsp;gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arguably the most attractive colour variant of the three, and is <em>inarguably</em>&nbsp;the most popular colour variant, as it outsells both the grey and the silver by some margin.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Just like iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s uses a 4-inch IPS LCD screen, and the resolution comes in at 640 x 1136 pixels, so it does, in short, sport one of Apple&rsquo;s splendid &lsquo;Retina Displays&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7020 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14730098548_7b807094c0_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s display" width="640" height="323" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a marvellous screen, with excellent colour reproduction and saturation, and impressively high viewing angles. On top of that, the oleophobic coating helps to ensure that the screen is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a fingerprint magnet.</p>
<p>At four inches, iPhone 5s certainly isn&rsquo;t the largest smartphone available, but it is perfect for single-handed use.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>iPhone 5s made headlines all round the world by pioneering an A7 chip with 64-bit architecture, but what does that actually mean, and does it give you any significant performance increases?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it&rsquo;s arguably more of a marketing ploy rather than an essential component, for now at least, as the chief reason to leap to 64-bit processors is to allow smartphones to accommodate more than 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>iPhone 5s, however, features 1GB of RAM. So whist there definitely is&nbsp;a noticeable speed increase from iPhone 5&rsquo;s chipset, simply from the very nature of how 64-bit processors work, it doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;yet&nbsp;take full advantage of the possibilities for extra memory.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7021 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14916706975_393e4aef6a_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s performance" width="640" height="317" /></p>
<p>Nit-picking aside, the Apple A7 processor is an extremely accomplished model, and combined with the sleek nature of iOS, it delivers a lightning-fast and incredibly slick user experience.</p>
<p>Whereas some Android phones do occasionally lag, if just for a moment, iPhone 5s hasn&rsquo;t ever heard of such a thing.&nbsp;It is simply one of the most streamlined smartphone experiences available.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Much like iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s sports an 8-megapixel iSight rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front-facing HD camera, and&nbsp;<em>again</em>&nbsp;like iPhone 5c, raw numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>One has to look at what other features the camera includes, or what it does with the megapixels in its sensor.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7022 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14913764661_11647e3cfb_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s camera" width="640" height="417" /></p>
<p>And so, while it may &lsquo;only&rsquo; offer 8-megapixels, the camera boasts a physically larger sensor (allowing more light in for brighter photos) and HDR (High Dynamic Range), to capture rich and beautiful photos.</p>
<p>iPhone 5s&rsquo; 8-megapixel iSight camera also features a True Tone flash, as well as some fantastic software perks, like auto image stabilisation, continuous burst mode, slow-motion video and panorama mode.</p>
<h2>Extra Features</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;standout &lsquo;extra&rsquo; on iPhone 5c is without a doubt AirDrop &ndash; a wireless file sharing service.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t help but admire this service, which lets you share files with another device, instantly, from the other side of the house. As is the case with everything Apple creates, AirDrop couldn&rsquo;t be easier to get a handle on; it&rsquo;s completely user friendly.</p>
<p>In addition to file sharing, AirDrop is great for playing music on your connected stereos all-round the house, without having to actually move anywhere.</p>
<p>A close second for the best &lsquo;extra&rsquo; feature is the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple has artfully integrated this into iPhone 5s&rsquo; home button, encircling it in a thin, premium-looking ring, whilst simultaneously wiping away the traditional white square, for a cleaner, more minimalistic look.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7023 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14730137297_da32a70103_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s Touch ID" width="464" height="640" /></p>
<p>iPhone 5s also features hordes of other cool apps and additions, like Siri, Safari, Maps, FaceTime, Messages and iBooks. All of which contribute to the delightful iPhone experience we can&rsquo;t get enough of.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>iPhone 5s balances beauty, brains and brawn like no other smartphone. It truly is a ground-breaking device. However, it&rsquo;s certainly worth considering its colourful counterpart, iPhone 5c.</p>
<p><strong>Both offer a very similar experience; however, iPhone 5c does come in at a cheaper price and more vibrant colours &ndash; if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for!</strong></p>
