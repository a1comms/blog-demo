<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Can&rsquo;t decide between iPhone and Android? We have the solution.</span></p>
<p>These days, there are so many iPhone cases on the market that adding another to the mix may seem like no big deal. Well, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You see, the latest iPhone case we&rsquo;ve seen is something that&rsquo;s rather special. Why? Well, it actually doubles as an Android phone (<em>kind of&hellip;</em>). Yep, you read that right. Say hello to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boboseye/eye-take-your-phone-to-the-next-level?utm_source=YouTube%20video">Eye - the Smart iPhone Case.</a></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJ-3EhbDWzE?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>So, what does Eye actually do? For starters, it&rsquo;s much more than just an extra screen for your iPhone. In fact, the case itself runs Android 7.1 Nougat, has 256GB storage, an IR blaster (for TVs) and its own battery life.</p>
<p>In short, Eye isn&rsquo;t just an iPhone case &mdash; it&rsquo;s an entirely separate gadget in its own right.</p>
<p>Eye has the capability to access your iPhone&rsquo;s camera, speakers and microphone. In theory (and if the promo video is anything to go by), this is a device that should work seamlessly with your iPhone to improve it on pretty much every level. From giving you an extra screen, to more functions than ever, this is one of the most ingenious iPhone cases we&rsquo;ve come across.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13498" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F2VCBzp_f_iUdqEH4x5fZCDHNZJr2i3JIA_vFzzSyuK5i_5jI3TgAXdWF5nj2HtRMUiiAmAKd97xbawNwPBhYNs7=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;The current technology of the iPhone LCD display is old. In comparison, Eye&rsquo;s screen is using the best display technology on the market today called AMOLED. With this technology, all colours, including real black, are much more vibrant on the screen. (There are rumours saying that only the premium version of the iPhone 8 will have an AMOLED display)&rdquo; explains the Kickstarter page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Additionally, the display size and resolution of the iPhone 6, 6s and 7 is only 4.7" and 1,334 x 750. Eye's screen is 5" and 1,920 x 1,080!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13501" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pegrYzMEwwwsVwtl4Iwni3_rDgjiCfhvEFZEYvRYTatoRhRGoCfz_jeNsxphPzb_rS8QPnRUEFsokTxI6AXJ9dKK=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, since the Eye has yet to be released to the general public, all we&rsquo;re going on right now is what the creators, ESTI, have to say about it.</p>
<p>Not everything looks perfect, though; the case is sure to increase the thickness of your iPhone. That&rsquo;s something that users may find annoying especially given that iPhones have got thinner and thinner in recent years.</p>

<p>Still, it doesn&rsquo;t look like many people have been put off. The Kickstarter funded project originally set out to raise $95,000 to launch Eye, but it looks to be in high-demand. The campaign now has a massive $115,000 behind it, from a whopping 828 backers. That means that we&rsquo;re sure to see these cases on the market before long. Hurrah for crowdfunding!</p>
