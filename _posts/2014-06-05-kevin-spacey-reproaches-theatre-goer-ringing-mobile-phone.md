<p><span class="postStandFirst">If you&rsquo;re planning to go and see Kevin Spacey in his legal drama Clarence Darrow, make sure your phone&rsquo;s switched to silent, or better yet &ndash; switched off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14351948695_686fab3044.jpg" width="500" height="281" /><span class="caption">Image courtesy of bbc.co.uk</span></p>
<p>The Oscar-winning actor chastised an audience member at the opening night of his one-man show at London&rsquo;s Old Vic, after a ringing mobile phone interrupted his performance.</p>
<p>Spacey turned his attention to the audience, whilst remaining in character, and said, "If you don't answer that, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience responded with a round of applause, whilst you can imagine the target of a vexed and unfazed Spacey was recoiling in his seat.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time a ringing mobile phone has been responsible for an untimely interruption, oh no.</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman, famous for his role as Wolverine in the X-Men series, dealt with the same situation during a Broadway performance alongside 00 Agent, Daniel Craig, back in 2009.</p>
<p>Both actors kept in character and told the person responsible, who was most likely cringing beyond belief at this point, to &lsquo;get the phone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s lucky Jackman and Craig stuck to&nbsp;<em>those&nbsp;</em>characters, because I&rsquo;m not sure Wolverine or Mr. Bond would have been so forgiving.</p>
<p>Of course, the award for &lsquo;the worst possible moment to receive a phone call&rsquo; would go to the ill-fated person, with a duck-quacking ringtone, who forgot to switch their phone off during a televised address from President Barack Obama at the White House.</p>
<p>President Obama immediately saw the funny side and turned to look for the source of the racket, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a duck quacking in there somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a very clear and valuable lesson to be learnt here: switch your phone to silent when you&rsquo;re in the presence of A-list celebrities and world-leaders, otherwise you risk being the subject of humiliating, public castigation. You have been warned.</strong></p>
