<h4>The future is here, guys!</h4>
<p>For just over a year now, Facebook has supported 360-degree photos. If you haven&rsquo;t uploaded any yourself, you&rsquo;ll at least have seen them on your News Feed from time to time. You know what we&rsquo;re talking about &mdash; the pictures that you can scroll around on to check out every angle.</p>

<p>Until now, though, the social media site didn&rsquo;t have a dedicated way of making the images for yourself. Well, times are changing! Starting right now (yes!), you can create your very own 360-degree photo using the app on your phone. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<h4>How to capture a 360-degree picture</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably raring to go ahead and take a 360-degree picture, right? Well, we don&rsquo;t blame you! As always, to make the most of new features that come out, it&rsquo;s well worth making sure that you update your app first. You will need to make sure that you have the latest version of the Facebook app before you can start enjoying this feature for yourself.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Open the Facebook app</h4>
<p>Of course, before you do anything, you need to open the app. Duh! This feature just so happens to work on both iOS and Android versions of the app so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about that!</p>
<h4>Step 2: Scroll to the top of your News Feed</h4>
<p>Once you get to the top of your News Feed, you should see a small button that says &lsquo;360 Photo&rsquo;. Click that, and you should find that you are able to take the picture right then and there. Still, you will need a steady hand&hellip;</p>
<h4>Step 3: Take your picture</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to take the picture. Of course, the key to this is making sure that you keep the central point at the same level as you move. It&rsquo;s much like taking a panoramic photo. You just need to hold down the button and turn your phone around to capture the image. Easy!</p>

<h4>So, what are you waiting for?</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re finished, just release the button and marvel at the beauty that is the 360-photo. (Honestly, these things are actually kind of cool!) What&rsquo;s more, you can do more than simply upload them to your timeline. Oh yes, Facebook has introduced a new feature that allows you to put 360-degree pictures as your cover photo too. Go ahead.. You know you want to!</p>
