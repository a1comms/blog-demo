<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Running out of costume ideas for Halloween? We&rsquo;ve got you covered.</span></p>
<p>The spookiest time of year is almost upon us, which means that it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about what Halloween costumes we&rsquo;re all going to wear.</p>
<p>Year after year, this decision is one that plagues the very best of us. We want to be the funniest, the scariest, or the most unique. Or, if it&rsquo;s possible, all three.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new Halloween costume on the scene, and it&rsquo;s as weird as it is wonderful. Snapchat fans will already love the many filters the app has to offer. The Dancing Hot Dog filter is particularly fun to use for almost any occasion&hellip;. What if you could wear it for a Halloween costume?</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 85%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l1K9Dcy7ww0CW3JHq" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you hadn&rsquo;t guessed yet, Snap Inc., i.e. Snapchat, has just released a new item to its Amazon store. The Dancing Hot Dog costume, which is based on the popular filter, is now available &mdash; just in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>The two-piece costume consists of a tunic and a set of arms and hands, which are attached at the sides (of course), as well as hotdog legs to cover up your own human ones.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15371" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ve3zNTLG4A6_IiJUy9Ajna1WS-voEusxxO0Hvxx-lgxN7ODCJA0titmEa9WOV_pKL0kZ-oZ2IdFVzOrIosHOhaI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, unlike some Halloween costumes, Snapchat&rsquo;s Dancing Hot Dog costume benefits from having convenient slits for your hands. That means you can poke your hands out and take selfie after selfie (presumably uploading to Snapchat with the Dancing Hot Dog filter engaged), without any restrictions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a millennial who&rsquo;s hoping to get your mitts on this trendy costume, we have some bad news for you. Brace yourself...</p>
<p>The Dancing Hot Dog costs a whopping $80, and worst of all, it doesn&rsquo;t ship to the UK at the moment. Still, it may be worth scouring the likes of eBay and Amazon to see if there are any sellers offering it. Good luck, hot dog fans!</p>
