<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Don&rsquo;t get left in the dog house this year (again)!</span></p>
<p>The day of love is here. Wait&hellip; Did you <em>seriously</em> forget about it again?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve messed up and let Valentine&rsquo;s Day slip your mind, there&rsquo;s still time to turn things around.</p>
<p>Here are three tips that will help you impress your partner and stay out of the dog house.</p>
<h2>1) Cook a Homemade Dinner for Two</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, all the fancy-pants restaurants are going to be booked up. C&rsquo;est la vie. You missed the boat.</p>
<p>However, you could make your partner feel extra special by whipping up a romantic meal for two at home.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic if you&rsquo;re no Jamie Oliver, there are some free cookery apps you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kitchen Stories</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20128" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7vThymkNPmUgFUrfBq06nBxZ7rNn8j5ScssQNc2gJ4X_pspSWkwZg_NeAsAT69yLLxTdjZJ1fGR3c96mSpW0wgCl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having trouble coming up with recipes? Try the Kitchen Stories app. This freebie has a massive range of recipes in the bank and, aside from easy-to-read instructions, you will also get the odd video tutorial too.</p>
<p><em>Download Kitchen Stories free on </em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kitchen-stories-free-video/id771068291?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>iOS</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ajnsnewmedia.kitchenstories&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Android </em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yummly Recipes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20127" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dXREJhyfrhd727XRWXKzKiDU39fli-PsExg8cszXNOueu5z_mgXlTSZyoLlffh3__iJPcLDClAcIClq6myFcyMW-=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>One of the best things about the Yummly app is that it allows you to search a whole range of websites at the touch of a button. What&rsquo;s more, you can also add filters to find the right type of food for you. So, if bae happens to be gluten-free, finding the right meal is simple.</p>
<p><em>Download Yummly Recipes on </em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yummly-recipes-shopping-list/id819440982?mt=8&amp;at=11lDJ&amp;ct=1572903X35d3a497a6b46b44ce77d82993359cb9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>iOS</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yummly.android&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Android </em></a></p>
<h2>2) Have a Movie Night Together</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite as romantic as snuggling up together under a duvet and watching some movies.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a low-cost way to woo your love, you might just have found it. If you don&rsquo;t already have a streaming subscription, check out these deals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vodafone Red Entertainment Plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20131" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bGS14D1gYyhwd3tMTwusxuoeZ4I5kIY-gFzV9LJb56u3eKIcDk9iTitG6dbtADEulVhF4kq6WOrl-upBnsFBES3r=s0" alt="" /></p>

<li><strong>Three Advance Plan</strong></li>

<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s also the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/three" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Advance Plan</a>, which comes with Go Binge on deals with 12GB of data or more. The Go Binge package means you can stream all the music and movies you want without eating into any of your data. Impressive stuff.</p>

<h2>3) Treat Them to a Last-Minute Gift</h2>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t want to show up empty handed this Valentine&rsquo;s Day. If you&rsquo;re looking to save yourself some pennies, though, why not check out some deals online? Here are a couple of ideas that you might want to try.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>O2 Priority offers</strong></li>
