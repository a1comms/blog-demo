<p><span class="postStandFirst">We&rsquo;ve all known this phone was on the way, long before it was officially unveiled, even as far back as when the Samsung Galaxy S4 was released, but now that the wraps have come off the Samsung Galaxy S5, we can finally see just how good this phone really is.</span></p>
<p>It should come as nor surprise when we say that the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> really is <em>very</em> good; it&rsquo;s one of a handful of devices that deserve the name &lsquo;superphone&rsquo;, but why is that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3754/13580419904_49e77b13ae_o.jpg" width="481" height="271" /></strong></p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p>Just like the Galaxy S4 before it, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is a gorgeous slab of loveliness, but this time, there&rsquo;s been a bit of a change in the industrial design shown off by Samsung, and it&rsquo;s a change inspired by a <em>different</em> Samsung phone. That phone is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and its influence is apparent in the backplate on the Galaxy S5, which now has a textured finish (much like that phablet), that gives it a unique look, while making it easier to keep a hold of. Combined with that beautiful 5.1-inch 1080p screen, the end result is a phone that&rsquo;s sure to set hearts a-flutter around the entire world.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 uses a Snapdragon 801 processor (the same chip found inside both the Sony Xperia Z2 and the newly-announced HTC One M8), clocked to 2.5GHz, and boy does it make a difference to how the phone performs! Put simply, the Galaxy S5 is <em>lightning</em> fast, and with up to 32GB of onboard storage (plus a microSD slot), there&rsquo;s plenty of room to store the stuff that matters most to you, whether that&rsquo;s games, or other apps, or music, or whatever.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7397/13580157425_f979f367b7.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 may not have the dual-lens action of the HTC One M8, but what it <em>does</em> have is a 16MP camera that produces glorious, sharp photos that are amongst the best seen on any smartphone so far. That camera is also packed with neat features, such as simultaneous HD video and photo capture, and face/smile detection, so you can be absolutely certain that you&rsquo;ll never feel let down by the camera in this superphone!</p>
<h2>Innovation/Unique Features</h2>
<p>So far, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has come across as an evolutionary upgrade to the Galaxy S4, instead of being revolutionary (which is <em>not</em> a bad thing, as the Galaxy S4 was <em>already</em> a fantastic phone). However, it does offer a few entirely new, or rarely seen features, that help to put it ahead of its rivals.</p>
<p>The first is the fingerprint scanner, which is PayPal-certified, thus allowing you to pay for things with PayPal, just by pressing a digit to that scanner. <em>That</em> is cool. Just as useful is the way the Galaxy S5 can now split data loads across both its 4G <em>and</em> WiFi connections, effectively doubling your internet speed. And once again, <em>that</em> is cool.</p>
<p>But perhaps the coolest feature is that the Samsung Galaxy S5, as well as being sexy and powerful, is water-resistant, which is always one of the most fantastic features you can have!</p>
<p>And thus, we can confidently say that the Korean manufacturer has done it yet again; Samsung has managed to capture lightning in a bottle, for the <em>fifth</em> time, and produce a phone that is truly worthy of the name &lsquo;superphone&rsquo;. In short, if you hadn&rsquo;t guessed, the Samsung Galaxy S5 comes <em>highly</em> recommended!<strong> </strong></p>
