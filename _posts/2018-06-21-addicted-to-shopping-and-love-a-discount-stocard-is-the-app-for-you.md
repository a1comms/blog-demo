<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Because no one likes to carry all their loyalty cards with them.</span></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a cheapskate to love the odd bargain! One of the best ways to save yourself some pennies is to get a loyalty card. If you&rsquo;re a Starbucks fiend or a frequent-flyer, you can get yourself some real discounts by saving up points in return for your loyalty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem &ndash; having a load of different cards in your wallet can be hassle. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a super simple way to solve that very problem. You can store all your loyalty cards on your mobile phone.</p>
<p>And no, we don&rsquo;t mean you need to get a load of different apps (which can be a pain in itself!). Instead, all you need to do is download one app &ndash; <a href="https://stocardapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stocard</a>!</p>
<h2>How to Use Stocard</h2>
<p>Rather than rifling through a whole load of cards and holding up the queue, you just need to use your tech to do the deed. The Stocard app means that you can keep all of your digital loyalty cards in one place and just present them when you need them. It&rsquo;s compatible with both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.stocard.stocard&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stocard-rewards-cards-wallet/id444578884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone</a>&hellip; (and even Apple Watch!).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17776" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4msDipiGN7nx60VMpxsYS-HEQTdu5bUQQ5tJMM53sQzWn6dnqfC8dxVgDNQnRk79U7cRo9g5ZBKqcR6KFGEXHkXscg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to take a step into the future, using Stocard couldn&rsquo;t be easier. When you&rsquo;ve downloaded the app, the setup will only take a minute or so. Scan the barcodes of the loyalty cards that you already have using the app. You can then start using the digital form of the card just like you would your physical loyalty card. Present it at the cash register, scan, and earn loads of rewards that you can use later.</p>
<h2>Extra Deals and Discounts!</h2>
<p>Sounds good, right? As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough, there&rsquo;s yet another perk to using the Stocard app. If you hit the &lsquo;Offers&rsquo; tab, you can find loads of exclusive deals. From discounts to timely deals, you&rsquo;ll be blown away by what you find. That means that you&rsquo;ll end up with even more savings. Nice.</p>
