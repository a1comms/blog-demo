<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 launch date has been <em>noted</em> in our diaries, with the newfangled phablet set to hit the UK in October.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5395 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/15155510088_0724092e7d_k-1024x1024.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will be available to pre-order from September 26th, and should launch on October 10<sup>th</sup>. But alas, its sister smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, will not reach these shores.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why people are getting worked up over the launch of this new phablet, because it is quite simply one of the most powerful and amazing phones to ever hit the market; it is one that takes the legacy of last year&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and makes it even more mind-blowing.</p>
<p>For starters, there&rsquo;s the 5.7-inch Quad-HD screen, and while that may be the same size as last year&rsquo;s model, the resolution has been bumped up to an enormous 1440 x 2560 pixels, the same as you find in the LG G3 (which sits on the smartphone/phablet border).</p>
<p>At the same time, the processor has been changed to a Snapdragon 805, and clocked to a whopping 2.7GHz, so we should see a nice speed boost over last year&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>The main rival for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will, of course, be the iPhone 6 Plus, and it&rsquo;s going to be interesting to watch that particular battle. It&rsquo;s not entirely clear how fast the processor in Apple&rsquo;s phablet is, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that we&rsquo;re not comparing like-for-like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5401 aligncenter" alt="iPhone 6 &amp; Samsung Galaxy Note 4 compare" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-Samsung-Galaxy-Note-4-compare.png" width="639" height="552" /><span class="caption">Image: Despite a smaller screen, the iPhone 6 Plus is actually larger than the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</span></p>
<p>So, the performance will likely be very similar between the two, although the Galaxy Note 4 does have 3GB of RAM, as opposed to the iPhone 6 Plus which houses 1GB. The Galaxy Note 4 also has a UV sensor, marking it out as a unique smartphone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll close this article, however, with a clarification: it&rsquo;s become clear, now, that the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is <i>not</i> coming to the UK. At present, there&rsquo;s no confirmation that it will ever come to the UK, either, which we were looking forward to, but at least we&rsquo;re getting its super-powered sibling.</p>
<p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will be available to pre-order from September 26th, and is due to land on UK shelves on October 10th.&nbsp;</strong></p>
