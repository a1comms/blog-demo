<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Facebook has some very exciting updates coming!</span></p>
<p>In the last decade, the social media site Facebook has become a central aspect of our daily lives. From &lsquo;checking in&rsquo; whenever we go out to eat to finding out what our ex-school mates have been up to lately, there&rsquo;s no end to what this site can do. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the platform has come a long, long way from its rather simple beginnings. So, with that in mind, what on earth does the future hold for it?</p>
<p>We might just have the answer. Last week, at Facebook's annual developer conference, the geniuses behind the platform had some pretty major announcements about where it&rsquo;s heading right now. From augmented reality to a brand new messenger service, here&rsquo;s what we know so far.</p>
<h2>1) You will be able to hang out in virtual reality with your pals</h2>

<p>Make no mistakes, VR is a massive deal &mdash; and it&rsquo;s something that the good people at Facebook want to use. Enter Facebook Spaces; a place where you can meet up with your online contacts in a virtual world.</p>
<p>Once you start using the system, you will have a digital avatar that can chill out with your friends and family in a completely digital space. The 360-video platform will allow you to feel like you&rsquo;re just about anywhere in the world with your besties. From the rainforest to the beach, you can meet up just about anywhere. What&rsquo;s more, you can make 3D shapes and move them around in this play-pretend location.</p>
<h2>2) There will be a Messenger 2.0</h2>
<p>There will be a major difference between the Messenger we know and love and 2.0 &mdash;&nbsp;artificial intelligence. Yes, the Facebook officials plan to weave even more AI into the platform which means that it will be easier to connect with businesses via the app.</p>
<p>The new Discover tab will mean that you can find businesses in the area that you may want to communicate with on some level. They will also be launching Chat Extensions which allow more than one user to talk to a business at the same time.</p>
<p>Oh, and as if that weren&rsquo;t enough, there will also be some changes to the games within the app. Facebook will soon be launching Rich Gameplay, which will allow for turn-by-turn games and new ways in which you can challenge your contacts via the app.</p>
<h2>3) There will also be a new AR platform</h2>
<p>One of the key things that Mr. Zuckerberg had to say at the event was that he wanted to "make the camera the first mainstream augmented reality platform." That&rsquo;s quite a claim. In the past AR has been launched on a variety of services, but has never actually taken off. So, what&rsquo;s new here?</p>
<p>Well, the takeaway is that Facebook will be launching a Camera Effects Platform &mdash; i.e. a whole load of AR tools that you should be able to use through your phone or tablet&rsquo;s camera system. Plus, there is the promise that it will be easier than ever for developers to create their own AR effects and the like and upload them to the platform. Interesting.</p>
<h2>4) The business bots will be improved</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a business owner or just have a Facebook page for some reason, this one&rsquo;s for you! Basically, the business bots should make the whole communicating with customers thing way easier than ever before. For example, if customers message you with a frequently asked question, the bots will give them an automatic reply that fits the bill. Genius.</p>
<h2>5) There will be a way smarter M digital assistant</h2>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, the M digital assistant is the system that&rsquo;s supposed to make the whole thing easier and more intuitive. For example, when you mention something in a chat like the fact that you need to pay someone back for something, this system will remind you of just that fact. It will also make recommendations for you when you&rsquo;re using Messenger such as where to eat or how to order some food online. Neat, huh?</p>
