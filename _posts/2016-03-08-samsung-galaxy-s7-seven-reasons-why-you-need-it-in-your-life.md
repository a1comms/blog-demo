<p><span class="caption postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung claims to have redefined the smartphone with its Samsung Galaxy S7, and we&rsquo;re inclined to agree. Here are seven reasons why.</span></p>
<p>As an Apple fanboy, I feel I have the advantage of critical distance when talking about <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a>. Unlike the launch of a new iPhone, I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to like it. I can take the device for what it is, and start from there.</p>
<p>After a few days of using it behind my iPhone&rsquo;s back, I&rsquo;ve come to a simple conclusion: this is, by some distance, the best Android mobile phone I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of reviewing. I found that there are seven prominent reasons that led me to my verdict, which is convenient as that number works well with the name of the handset.</p>
<p>Here are my seven reasons why you need Samsung Galaxy S7 in your life&hellip;</p>
<h2>1. Galaxy S7 can join you for a bath</h2>
<p>Leave your rubber duck in the bathroom cupboard, because you&rsquo;ll be playing with Samsung Galaxy S7 next time you have a bath. An IP68 rating means that it boasts the highest water-resistance currently available on a mobile phone. So aside from splashing about in the tub, you can place your Galaxy S7 on wet surfaces, drop it in water, take photos on the beach and answer calls in a downpour &ndash; all without the usual concerns of damaging your smartphone.</p>

<h2>2. Galaxy S7 has all the room you need</h2>
<p>Straight out of the box, Samsung Galaxy S7 is built with 32GB of storage space. Granted, the software shotguns a portion of this before you get a say, so the actual amount of space isn&rsquo;t quite as ample. However, now that the microSD card slot has made a dramatic return, you have up to an extra 200GB of room to work with, for stowing all of you files and folders. That means no more tearful culling sprees, where you&rsquo;re forced to sacrifice the more neglected apps to accommodate new ones.</p>

<h2>3. Galaxy S7 makes you feel like a wizard&hellip; Harry.</h2>
<p>Remember how in the Harry Potter movies, photos in newspapers and picture frames have a life of their own? Motion Photo on Samsung Galaxy S7 is kind of like that, but much less creepier. When you take a picture, the device records three seconds before the moment you pressed the shutter, so each one of your photos comes with its own brief scene of action. You can even choose which frame you want to preserve as the still photo. How impressed am I on a scale of 1-10? About nine and three quarters.</p>

<h2>4. Galaxy S7&rsquo;s display will blow your mind</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to cast your mind too far back, to recall the primitive, monochromatic mobile phone screens from days of yore. In what feels like a heartbeat, smartphones like Samsung Galaxy S7 sport displays that are, quite frankly, far better than the TV in my bedroom. The sheer density of pixels, richness of colour and sharpness of clarity on Galaxy S7&rsquo;s Quad HD are mind blowing when you really think about it. Even compared to the leading flagships from three or four years ago, Samsung Galaxy S7 makes them look like an Etch A Sketch.</p>

<h2>5. Galaxy S7&nbsp;keeps its eyes on the prize</h2>
<p>According to Samsung, when taking a photo, the Galaxy S7 can focus &lsquo;as quickly and as accurately as you would with your own eyes&rsquo;. Presuming that's a fair statement, it&nbsp;illustrates&nbsp;just how ridiculously advanced smartphone cameras are getting. Samsung Galaxy S7 is actually the first to feature this technology, called &ldquo;Dual Pixel&rdquo;, which harnesses the power of two photodiodes, instead of one, so basically, when you press the shutter, Galaxy S7 will respond with more speed and precision, allowing you to capture the moment you want, not the one after it.</p>

<h2>6. Galaxy S7 guarantees less rage-quitting</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever played competitive games online, then I don&rsquo;t need to remind you of those times where a second of lag left your defence split wide open, or your aim down the crosshairs of an assault rifle slightly skewed. Samsung Galaxy S7 houses a 30% faster CPU and 64% faster GPU over its predecessor, which takes mobile gaming to whole new level. Like, some sort of hidden bonus level. There&rsquo;s no lag, and no need to rage quit. With built-in gameplay recording, you can support your YouTube channel if you have one, otherwise you can just share your killstreaks on Facebook and Twitter. Hashtag headshot.</p>

<h2>7. Galaxy S7 edge isn&rsquo;t just <em>edgy</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s innovative</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by Samsung Galaxy S7 edge; it&rsquo;s not just a pretty face. The curved glass that flows down the sides does offer an aesthetic charm, but it also acts as a space to navigate to certain apps and functions with more convenience. The edges accommodate up to 9 different panels, giving you what you need straight away &ndash; like calling a taxi or getting sport updates. The app panel supports up to 10 shortcuts to your favourite or most used apps. And the edge even offers a set of quick tools, like a ruler, flashlight and compass.</p>
