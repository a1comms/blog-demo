<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Heard the terms &lsquo;HomeKit&rsquo; and &lsquo;connected home&rsquo; bandied about, but haven&rsquo;t a clue what&rsquo;s occurring? Don&rsquo;t fret, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</span></p>
<p>HomeKit is Apple&rsquo;s framework for communicating with and controlling connected accessories. And by connecting accessories, I&rsquo;m talking crazy, futuristic scenes like leaving the house in the morning and your door automatically locks itself, the lights extinguish and the thermostat lowers, all without any human input as you scald your mouth tentatively sipping coffee in the car to work.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, like Philips and August, are designing these smart accessories with Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit technology very much in mind, allowing you to use your iOS device as a hub (or <em>command centre</em> if you&rsquo;re feeling like a boss) that provides full autonomy over your home. Hence &lsquo;connected home&rsquo;.</p>
<p>With the right HomeKit-enabled accessories and corresponding apps, you can control everything including your lighting, locks, thermostat, sensors, plugs, switches, blinds and spouse. Okay, not your spouse, but that technology can&rsquo;t be too far away.</p>

<p>If you check out Phillips Hue, for example, you can choose from a range of lighting accessories that not only give you influence over the brightness/dimness of your lamps, but also allow you to experiment with different colours to match your mood or activity. You can even set your Philips Hue lamp to gradually increase in light intensity that can allegedly wake you more naturally in the morning. Of course, all of this is managed from your iPhone.</p>

<p>This is genuinely a very exciting time to be alive. Depending on the type of home accessory you have installed, you can wake up to a warm bedroom and boiled kettle, and get home to a well-lit house and unlocked door. Obviously, these are controlled triggers; your front door isn&rsquo;t going to unlock itself during the dead of night&hellip; but rather, your home runs on triggers linked to time, your location and settings. It&rsquo;s pretty insane.</p>

<p>Using iPhone, you can even ask Siri to do the work for you, if you don&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;manually&rsquo; take action using your accessory app. Being the all-knowing, all-powerful assistant that it is, Siri knows exactly which HomeKit-enabled accessories you have installed in your home, so you can just nonchalantly sit back and command &ldquo;Turn the light off upstairs&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Lock the front door&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With motion sensors, you don&rsquo;t even need to do so much as strain your voice. A motion sensor positioned in your kitchen can switch the lights on every time you walk in. But it&rsquo;s cleverer than just that. Set additional conditions such as time and sunset, so your lights only wake up after dark.</p>

<p>Writing this, I feel like I&rsquo;m describing some sort of domestic paradise from Back to the Future Part II. But I&rsquo;m really not. These accessories already exist, and they&rsquo;re getting better and more capable. All you need to get started is your iPhone and a small budget to work with. <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases">Subscribe to our mailing list</a> and we&rsquo;ll be bringing you some special offers on smart home accessories soon.</p>
