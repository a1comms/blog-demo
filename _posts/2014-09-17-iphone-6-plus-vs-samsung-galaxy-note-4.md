<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">So, the iPhone 6 Plus, eh? Apple&rsquo;s finally gone and released a phablet, and since the company&rsquo;s arch rival Samsung has been making phablets for years, it only seems fair to pit the iPhone 6 Plus against the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to see which one is best. Grab some popcorn, because this particular match-up is going to be <i>good</i>...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="size-full wp-image-5401 aligncenter" alt="iPhone 6 &amp; Samsung Galaxy Note 4 compare" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-Samsung-Galaxy-Note-4-compare.png" width="639" height="552" /></p>
<p>After months of rumours, Apple has <i>finally</i> launched its first big-screen phablet, one with a screen that crashes through the 5-inch barrier. Quite frankly, it&rsquo;s not <i>that</i> surprising that the Cupertino giant has made this move, it&rsquo;s really more of a surprise that they haven&rsquo;t made a phablet until now.</p>
<p>Of course, the iPhone 6 Plus wasn&rsquo;t the only phablet launched in September. Samsung has also launched their latest entry in that super-sized class of devices, so what we have here is an opportunity to pit the two manufacturers against each other in a kind of like-for-like style, to answer a question lots of people have asked. So, iPhone 6 Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 4: which is best?</p>
<p>And rest assured, this one is going to be <i>close</i>...</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5331" alt="Picture1" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Picture1-1024x327.png" width="960" height="306" />The first category is one that can only be judged subjectively, and if we&rsquo;re totally honest, we really can&rsquo;t single out one of these two beauties as being definitively better. They&rsquo;re <i>both</i> gorgeous, but they go about <i>being</i> gorgeous in different ways, with the iPhone 6 Plus going for a sumptuous metal body, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has the same faux-leather backplate as its predecessor, which actually serves to make the phone easier to hold.</p>
<p>And so, this first category is a draw!</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5126" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - processor" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-18.26.57-1024x500.png" width="576" height="281" /></p>
<p>On paper, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 <i>should</i> win this category, but the simple fact is this: while it has a faster processor with more cores (not to mention more RAM, with 3Gb instead of 1), the two phones run on different operating systems, and iOS is optimised to run perfectly on the dual-core processor in the iPhone 6 Plus. In real terms, that means that the performance is surprisingly evenly matched, even when you take the hardware differences into account.</p>
<p>So, basically, <i>this</i> category is a draw as well!</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5117" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus camera" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus-camera.jpg" width="447" height="250" /></p>
<p>You may have noticed a running theme here (and considering how much we like the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, that should tell you how good the iPhone 6 Plus is), and that&rsquo;s going to be continued in this category. If we look at just the megapixel count, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 would win (as it has a 16MP camera), but we have to take the other bits of the camera into account. So we have to consider that the 8MP camera in the iPhone 6 Plus also had a dual-LED flash, and a physically bigger sensor, which more or less negates any advantage the Galaxy Note 4 has in terms of raw numbers.</p>
<p>All of that means that, yes, this category is <i>also</i> a draw!</p>
<h2>User Experience</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5332" alt="SM-N910_Charcoal Black_Combination-Pen_018" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/SM-N910_Charcoal-Black_Combination-Pen_018.jpg" width="350" height="350" /></p>
<p>When it comes to user experience, we have to be honest and say that we&rsquo;re looking at another draw. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that; on the one hand you have the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, whose S-Pen stylus opens up a whole new list of ways for you to interact with your phone. On the other hand, though, Android has a steeper learning curve than iOS (one of the things that has always set the iPhone range apart is how easy the phones are to use), so the iPhone 6 Plus is going to be easier for first-time smartphone users to get to grips with.</p>
<p>And so, yet again, this category is a draw, but there&rsquo;s one category we haven&rsquo;t looked at yet, and it&rsquo;s a category that could finally see one of the two phones come out victorious...</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>While the iPhone 6 Plus may have a brand new screen that&rsquo;s far bigger than any previous iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a marginally <i>bigger</i> screen. Even more important than that, however, is the resolution: the Galaxy Note 4 has the same Quad-HD resolution as the mighty LG G3. What does that mean? Well, quite simply, it means that the screen on the Galaxy Note 4 is both bigger <i>and </i>sharper than the one on the iPhone Plus.</p>
<p>And so, as we close out this little battle, we finally have a winner...</p>
<p>The simple fact is this: both phones are utterly amazing. It&rsquo;s just that, while the iPhone 6 Plus is a truly fantastic phone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is an equally fantastic phone <i>with a Quad-HD screen</i>.</p>
<p><b>However, we&rsquo;ll close this article by saying this: while the Galaxy Note 4 has grabbed the narrowest of victories here, these two phones, when viewed side by side, represent the absolute peak of mobile technology, so whichever one you go for, you&rsquo;re getting one of the nicest phones we&rsquo;ve ever seen! </b></p>
