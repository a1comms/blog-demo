<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Samsung Galaxy S6 has finally shown its face... and it&rsquo;s brought a friend with it! Say hello to the utterly gorgeous, relentlessly powerful Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, a flagship superphone with an &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; new twist in the form of a wraparound screen...</span></p>

<p>The biggest news from MWC 2015 has undoubtedly been the launch of Samsung Galaxy S6, but that phone is not the <em>only</em> one that the Korean manufacturer unveiled; Samsung actually unveiled two new superphones, and the other one has a neat little trick up its sleeve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, and that name should give you a big clue as to what its party trick might be.</p>
<p>The best way to think of Galaxy S6 edge is thusly: it&rsquo;s what happens when you take the sheer brilliance of the standard Galaxy S6, and give it a wraparound screen just like the one on Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Edge. However, it turns out that there&rsquo;s a <em>big</em> difference between this and its curved predecessor, because where Note Edge had a development kit that allowed app developers to take advantage of that curved part of the screen, Galaxy S6 edge will not use it.</p>
<p>And so, while you <em>can</em> swipe through notifications on that curved edge panel, or read news headlines for example, the main reason for its existence is an aesthetic one. While it does add a bit of extra functionality, the point of its existence is more to make the phone look gorgeous, and feel even better in your hand.</p>
<p>Even if that edge panel doesn&rsquo;t offer the same level of functionality as on Note Edge, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge remains a relentlessly powerful phone, with a lightning fast octa-core processor, a 5.1-inch Quad-HD screen, 3GB of RAM, and a 16MP camera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take a deeper look at Samsung Galaxy S6 edge once it goes on general release, but it&rsquo;s fair to say, right now, that it&rsquo;s definitely looking to be a show-stopper!</p>
