<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">After months of waiting, the LG G4 has <em>finally</em> been unveiled! Join us as we take our first look at LG&rsquo;s new powerhouse, and see precisely what makes this superphone so brilliant...</span></p>
<p><strong>The LG G3 was one of the best phones of 2014, but time marches ever onward (as time is wont to do, since time is <em>really</em> selfish), and it&rsquo;s time for LG to unveil a new flagship, one that can take the utter brilliance of its predecessor, and start a fight with newer smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S6.</strong></p>
<p>So, has it succeededâ€‹ in doing that? Let&rsquo;s find out...</p>
<h2><strong>LG G4 Design</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6636 " src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Picture2-1024x522.png" alt="Picture2" width="630" height="321" /></p>
<p>The LG G3 was a bit of a looker, and we&rsquo;re happy to say that the exact same thing can be said of the LG G4 (although it&rsquo;s <em>slightly</em> bigger and heavier than its predecessor). As you&rsquo;d expect, the G4 looks quite a lot like its predecessor, although there are a couple of notable differences. The first is that, unlike the G3, the LG G4 lacks the metal effect &lsquo;chin&rsquo; on the front, with the fascia now being made up solely of black bezel and screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the <em>back</em> of the phone where you&rsquo;ll find the biggest change, however, as the new, removable backplate comes in a range of different colours, finishes and even <em>materials</em>; one of the new backplates, for instance, is covered in leather (while ceramic and metal backplates have <em>also</em> been shown off, and are looking <em>stunning</em>), so basically, the LG G4 is as customisable as it is gorgeous.</p>
<h2><strong>LG G4 Display</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6634 " src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Picture4-300x187.png" alt="Picture4" width="570" height="355" /></p>
<p>At this point, we all know why the LG G3 captured the imagination of so many people: it was that 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen, the one that a great many of us called the best screen ever put on a phone. It should come as no surprise that the LG G4 also uses a 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen (dubbed the Quantum display), so it&rsquo;s just as unbelievably sharp as last year&rsquo;s model. However, LG has crammed some extra improvements into the screen, so that it&rsquo;s brighter than last year&rsquo;s model, as well as having a much broader and richer colour palette.</p>
<p>In short, LG has, yet again, made a phone with one of the best screens <em>ever</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>LG G4 Camera</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6635" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/P1140797-650-80.jpg" alt="P1140797-650-80" width="650" height="365" /></p>
<p>Pre-launch rumours (not to mention LG&rsquo;s own launch teasers) suggested that we could expect to see a lot of improvements in the camera on the LG G4, and it turns out that they were <em>not</em> lying. Coming in at 16MP, the camera now has an f/1.8 lens, so that it&rsquo;ll capture a lot more light than its predecessor (<em>80%</em> more than the LG G3, a fact that&rsquo;s aided by the G4 having a physically larger sensor).</p>
<p>On top of that, you get manual controls, letting you adjust the white balance, the ISO, and even the shutter speed (while letting you save images in RAW format).</p>
<p>Laser autofocus also makes a comeback (with a focusing time of 0.276 seconds being mentioned), and you&rsquo;ll be able to take a quick photo just by double-tapping the rear key. Throw in optical image stabilisation and a <em>colour spectrum sensor</em> (making for a genuinely smart auto mode), and the end result is a truly phenomenal camera!</p>
<p>Oh, and the selfie camera? It&rsquo;s <em>8MP</em>. That&rsquo;s kind of amazing.</p>
<h2>LG G4 <strong>Power &amp; Performance</strong></h2>
<p>The LG G4 uses a Snapdragon 808 processor, and the notable thing about Snapdragon 808 is that it&rsquo;s a <em>six</em>-core processor (or <em>hexa-core</em>, if you feel like it). The important thing to take away is that the processor is very fast, and so the phone is going to be really responsive.</p>
<p>Of course, when we&rsquo;re talking about performance, we need to look at more than just the processor; we also need to take into account the phone&rsquo;s memory (specifically the RAM), as that&rsquo;s going to have as much of an effect on the performance as the processor speed.</p>
<p>So, basically, when we see that the LG G4 has 3GB of RAM, we get very happy indeed, &lsquo;cos dear lord, that makes the LG G4 really lightning fast!</p>
<h2><strong>LG G4 User Experience</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6637" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Picture3-1024x579.png" alt="Picture3" width="700" height="395" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through the specs and looked at the numbers, and now we come to the section that really matters: the user experience. What is the LG G4 actually like to <em>use</em>?</p>
<p>Well frankly, it feels amazing. The raw processing grunt inside the phone makes sure that it&rsquo;s screamingly fast, and supremely responsive, but the software takes that power and makes it <em>simple</em>. The LG G4 uses Android Lollipop, of course, but with LG&rsquo;s own UX 4.0 running over the top of it; LG describes that as a &ldquo;human-centric UX&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s a brilliant way of harnessing all that power in a way that makes the user feel more at home and in control.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re talking about user experience, we have to also mention the 3000mAh battery, because unlike its predecessor, the battery is <em>removable</em> (so you can swap it out for a spare one if you run out of juice). Oh, and in addition to the 32GB of onboard storage, there&rsquo;s also a microSD slot, and as an increasing number of people are beginning to say, a phone with a memory card slot is just <em>better</em> than a phone without.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>We were blown away by the LG G3, last year, but if we&rsquo;re honest, the main reason why we were blown away was that screen; the rest of the phone was brilliant, but it was the screen that really got our attention.</p>
<p><strong>With the LG G4, however, what grabs us is, well, the entire package. It&rsquo;s a <em>stupendously</em> good phone that&rsquo;s an absolutely joy to use, and quite frankly, we adore it!</strong></p>
