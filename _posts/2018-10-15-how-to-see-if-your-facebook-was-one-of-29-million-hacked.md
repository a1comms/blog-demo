<p>Brace yourself. A massive 29 million Facebook accounts have been hacked. Let that sink in for a moment. That&rsquo;s a <em>whole </em>load of private information. The breach was announced two weeks ago and, right now, nobody is entirely sure how the hack will affect users.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried that your account could be one of the unlucky ones, however, Facebook has a simple and straightforward way to find out. Ensure that you&rsquo;re logged in on your laptop and then head to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/securitynotice?ref=sec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Help Centre</a>. Across the top of the screen, the tab will read: &ldquo;An important update about Facebook's recent security incident.&rdquo; Indeed.</p>
<h2>How to Find out if You&rsquo;ve Been Hacked</h2>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/securitynotice?ref=sec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Help Centre page</a> and you should see a notice that applies to your account.</p>
<p>It will say one of various messages that the company has put out about the hack incident. If your account is safe and sound, you will likely see this message:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Based on what we've learned so far, your Facebook account has not been impacted by this security incident. If we find more Facebook accounts were impacted, we will reset their access tokens and notify those accounts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Should you see this little message, Facebook believes that your account has not been compromised, which is sure to be a huge relief. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that things could change.</p>
<p>Since the social media site does not have all the information right now, the powers behind it could well find that more accounts were affected than they first thought.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15277" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cO7hs4dUET_OTSsaJq0xt95y6sEabjHhQ-RFcMdZIiQ15i38kaNcoSY77Z-P-c3_GG4KdFR6UiJNHvIs2J9GFpUs=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>What if Your Account Has Been Hacked?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you were hacked (or there&rsquo;s a chance that you were!), you will see an completely different notification on your screen.</p>
<p>The message will let you know what pieces of information Facebook believes the hackers have. It should be a fairly detailed description about the issue, including what they may know about your account.</p>
<p>Wondering what that scary notification might look like? Well, Mike Isaac, a reporter for the New York Times, shared a helpful picture of his message with the world via Twitter. The notification listed all of the things that the hackers may know including his marital status, hometown, date of birth and current location. Terrifying stuff.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">now the negative: if you've been affected by this attack, this is the wealth of personal information they've accessed.</p>
<p>the below screen is for my personal account, which was affected. thanks Facebook! <a href="https://t.co/aa7jaEepro">pic.twitter.com/aa7jaEepro</a></p>

<p>Either way, Facebook will be keeping people up to date with the latest developments as they learn more about the situation. There&rsquo;s likely to be more updates about it on the Help Centre so it&rsquo;s worth checking regularly if you&rsquo;re worried. Watch this space.</p>
