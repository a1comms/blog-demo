<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The power is in the palm of your hands!</span></p>
<p>The brand-new Control Center featured on iOS 11 has got everyone talking. It looks better than ever, feels slicker than a greaser&rsquo;s hair, and is turning more heads than a puppet master. Win, win, and win! The likelihood is that you&rsquo;re just getting used to using the quick access buttons here, but there&rsquo;s something you should know.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the Control Center has a hidden feature that you may not have discovered yet. You now have the power to customise the whole layout, adding the tools you use the most. But how, you say? Well, the first step is finding the customisation options. To do that, head to:</p>
<p><strong>Settings > Control Center > Customise Controls</strong></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;ll see a list of the quick-access tools you already have featured in your Control Center. If there are any that you don&rsquo;t want, you can simply click the red minus icon to remove them. Nothing could be quicker or easier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15083" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N-ADNHSh4fQ_-gPN2kg4B0QUGo8WnC6C93M-kYtuM4XXHGonloeuy6CsGbwXbMNKmegdXm83-fUAmUDA1BULue4D=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s a whole list of extra features just below the More Controls header. You can, of course, add any of these to the Control Center by pressing the little green plus icons next to each of the features. For example, you may want to add Notes, Low Power Mode, or the new Screen Recording (yep, it&rsquo;s <em>just </em>what it sounds like) feature to this area.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15081" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4dWSLkmj0r_Yt9kiFd_1oZr9oS9loE7DGGl-IUlbYzpfLDuX4Vzko5YuAO_9NHKb0TzN1xyr3Q3p1-QQlWSrM7o3=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re happy with your customised Control Center layout, it&rsquo;s time to check it out, and test how it works. You can view the Control Center by swiping up from the base of your phone screen. All the tools and shortcuts you&rsquo;ve chosen in the settings will be shown here in an instant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15082" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5n79cskt1aMeGr4hJ57RdUZN7VRZFJbqSiZksu36VrETLEHlrCmkdWLFhFY9otcdP0i8Vtv-VJTVlzHYKc6f61LE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, you can also use 3D Touch (long press) to open up more options within the Control Center. For example, you can select different levels of brightness on the torch. Or set the timer for a given length. We&rsquo;ll leave you to test the rest!</p>
