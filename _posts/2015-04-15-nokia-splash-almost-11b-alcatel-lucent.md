<p><span class="postStandFirst">Nokia has announced its intention to buy Alcatel-Lucent in a multi-billion pound deal. What will this news mean for consumers, and does it mean we might see some new phones wearing the Nokia badge?</span></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6551" align="alignnone" width="960"]<img class="wp-image-6551 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Nokia-Alcatel-1024x691.png" alt="Nokia Alcatel" width="960" height="647" /> Nokia's purchase of Alcatel-Lucent will enable the advancement of the 'Internet of things'.[/caption]</p>
<p>The name Nokia is slowly being phased out by Microsoft (who bought out Nokia&rsquo;s phone business in 2014), so that we&rsquo;re seeing it less and less on production phones, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Nokia, as a <em>company</em>, doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, Nokia&rsquo;s star is on the rise again, although according to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/15/us-nokia-alcatel-lucent-m-a-idUSKBN0N60CL20150415">Reuters</a>, it&rsquo;s in an area where consumers might not immediately notice.</p>
<p>Specifically, it&rsquo;s in terms of mobile communications <em>infrastructure</em>, and this boost in power is due to Nokia&rsquo;s planned purchase of Alcatel-Lucent, for the princely sum of 15.6 billion euros (just over &pound;11 billion).</p>
<p>The deal will see Nokia&rsquo;s market share in the telecoms equipment business rise to 35%, putting the company second only to Ericsson, who has 40%, and above the 20% owned by Chinese company Huawei.</p>
<h2>How will this affect consumers?</h2>
<p>Naturally, the question that most people have been asking is: how might this affect consumers? Does it mean that we might start seeing new phones with a Nokia badge on them, once again?</p>
<p>The benefits may be somewhat &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; to consumers, but they <em>will</em> exist; think in terms of things like improved call quality and internet speeds, due to networks having newer and more advanced equipment. See the infographic above for more.</p>
<p>What we <em>won&rsquo;t</em> see, in all likelihood, is new phones wearing the Nokia badge; neither Nokia or Alcatel are in the phone business any longer, so we&rsquo;re <em>very</em> unlikely to see any new Nokia mid-rangers to rival the likes of the Moto G.</p>
<p><strong>And so, in spite of us not seeing any new Nokia phones, this deal has the potential to seriously improve the experience of using a mobile phone. Stay tuned for more news. </strong></p>
