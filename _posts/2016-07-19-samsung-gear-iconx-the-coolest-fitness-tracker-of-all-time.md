<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If you didn't have any motivation to hit those fitness goal, you will now.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not often we take the time to write about accessories, but Samsung has given us no choice.</p>
<p>The South Korean has produced a pair of cordless earbuds that come complete with built-in, standalone fitness tracking, as well as storage for your music. They totally rock.</p>
<p>Called Samsung Gear IconX, these earbuds have all the necessary features to work independently of a mobile phone, capable of tracking your activity and feeding back updates on everything from speed to distance, duration to heart rate, and even the number of calories burnt &ndash; all via a dedicated voice guide (or coach, if you like).</p>

<p>Then, when you do have your smartphone within reach, your earbuds sync the data so you can review everything in more detail within the S Health app.</p>
<p>But no workout is complete without your accompanying tunes. And let&rsquo;s face it, having your phone swing about in your pocket not only looks ridiculous, but doesn&rsquo;t feel so great when it swings into a particularly precious area. With a pair of Gear IconX earbuds plugged in, you get your cake, and you get to eat it.</p>

<p>Built with 4GB of internal memory, you can store about 1000 tracks on what has to be one of the smallest MP3 players. Bluetooth enabled, you can stream wireless from your phone, too. Just be careful of that swinging pocket&hellip;</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;d expect, Samsung Gear IconX earbuds are fully controllable from the devices themselves, no phone needed. Play your music, pump up the volume and skip a track. You can even take or reject a call. All done by taping or swiping the earbud in different ways.</p>
<p>The case is just as cool. It doubles as a charger, so you can refuel the earbuds whenever they&rsquo;re not in use, without any real effort. Let&rsquo;s face it, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong than gearing up for a workout and realising your iPod Suffle&rsquo;s flat out of battery.</p>

<p>Of course, you must be wondering how much these little numbers will set you back. And to be honest, at &pound;169, they&rsquo;re not at all outrageous, considering they&rsquo;re both an independent fitness tracker and MP3 player (earphones included&hellip; badum-cha!).</p>
