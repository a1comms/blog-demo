<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">When your phone case is more valuable than your phone, you&rsquo;ve probably got too much money.</span></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your shiny new iPhone, there&rsquo;s just one thing you need to wrap around it &ndash; a case!</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;ve all got different budgets, paying around &pound;10-&pound;20 for a standard iPhone 7 case seems reasonable. You may well opt for a cute Disney design, or maybe a glossy metallic one. Or perhaps something with a classy leather look.</p>
<p>Personally, I tend to change my phone case every few months. I get tired of looking at the same old rainbow pattern (yes, I really had that!) and fancy something new every now and then. That&rsquo;s why the affordability of the everyday cases on the market is a real selling point for me. I can switch things up without paying a fortune for the pleasure.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got thousands to spare, though, how about something a little more <em>chic</em>? Louis Vuitton (US) released a line of iPhone cases, and they&rsquo;re a little more high-end than your standard plastic number. Dubbed the &lsquo;Eye-Trunk&rsquo;, this range of cases has something a little special about it. Each is inspired by the now-infamous original LV suitcases&hellip;</p>
<p>Coming in at the top of the price list is the golden crocodile leather number, complete with metal corners and a snazzy latch on the back of it. Of course, the idea here is that the phone looks like one of the brand&rsquo;s very own suitcases or, indeed, handbags. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the case is a thing or real luxury and beauty, and the price certainly reflects that at $5,500 (around &pound;4,440).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a plainer, and more understated, Louis Vuitton design that is certain to catch your eye. With a subtle, brown canvas back and hard frame, this design is less garish than the first. What&rsquo;s more, it has the LV logo all over it so there&rsquo;s just no mistaking the brand of the case. For an iPhone 7 version of this case, you&rsquo;ll have to part with &pound;790.</p>

<p>Mysteriously, the crocodile leather case seems to have disappeared from Louis Vuitton&rsquo;s site in between us hearing about it, and writing this article. The good news, however, is other ludicrously priced cases are still available, ranging from a modest &pound;185 to &pound;790.</p>
