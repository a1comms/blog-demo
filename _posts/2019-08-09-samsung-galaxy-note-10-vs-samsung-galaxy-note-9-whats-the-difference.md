<p>The new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-note-10-aura-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy Note 10</a> has been announced&hellip; and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the Note series looks stunning all-screen look and a flawless display. But will it live up to the hype?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare it to its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, to find out what has changed along the way.</p>
<h2>Things to Note: Design</h2>
<p>While the general look of the Note 10 and Note 9 is quite similar, there are some key differences here. For example, the later edition of the phone features a punch-hole camera lens in the top of the screen. When it comes to the Note 9 this is sat in a small screen bezel at the top.</p>
<p>Although, the Note 10 is a little smaller than its predecessor, this is not likely to be a noticeable difference. On the rear, the camera lens setup is horizontal on the Note 9, while the Note 10 has literally flipped this, with a vertical line instead.</p>

<p>When it comes to the colour options here, there is a pretty major difference. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is available in Aura Glow and Aura Black. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 came in three colour variants &ndash; purple, blue and black.</p>
<h2>Things to Note: Display</h2>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s talk about the displays. Packing a 6.3-inch Full HD+ resolution Dynamic AMOLED displays, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 has a killer display. It&rsquo;s an impressive looking screen, which offers the edge-to-edge look. The lack of bezels around the side of the phone screen here make a serious difference to the overall style of the phone.</p>
<p>Throwing back to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 device, you&rsquo;ve actually got a slightly larger dynamic AMOLED display coming in at 6.4-inches. However, it sports the Quad HD+ resolution, which means that it&rsquo;s likely to be less clear than the Note 10. There are also bezels around the edge and, notably, at the top of the screen here.</p>

<h2>Things to Note: Camera</h2>
<p>Ready to take some astounding photography? All of the Note series devices excel when it comes to this area, and so you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 boasts a dual setup on the back with two 12-megapixel lens. Over on the front, the selfie camera comes in at 8-megapixel. All of the above is enough to help you take epic pictures.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 takes things to a new level when it comes to photography. On the rear, there&rsquo;s a triple lens setup. We&rsquo;re talking two 12-megapixel cameras alongside a 16-megapixel lens. The front camera is a 10-megapixel lens offering which means that you can take your selfie game to the next level.</p>

<h2>Things to Note: Power</h2>
<p>Under-the-hood, the two Note series phones are highly similar. Both of these devices are powered by the <span class="spec-copy">Exynos </span>chipsets (<span class="spec-copy">Exynos 9810 for the Note 9 and Exynos 9825 on the Note 10).</span></p>
<p>That means that both the Note 9 and Note 10 devices are powerful machines. Most users should find that these handsets are speedy and smooth when they are using them.</p>
<p>To maintain peak performance, you&rsquo;re going to need juice that lasts and lasts. Powering up these devices should be super quick too. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 boasts the Qi wireless charging feature, while the Note 10 has the Qi wireless 2.0 feature. The former has a 4000 mAh battery while the latter has a 3500 mAh pack. It&rsquo;s a small difference.</p>
<h2>Things to Note: S-Pen</h2>
<p>A far cry from the static stylus of models past, the S-Pen is now a gadget in its own right. With the Note 9 edition of the pen, we saw some massive advancements.</p>
<p>This was the first time that the stylus became a remote control for the mobile device. We also saw the introduction of Air Actions, allowing users to use gestures to control the phone&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the difference when it comes to the Note 10 S-Pen? The device still packs all the features that the previous incarnation did. However, this version also has the handwriting to text feature. That means that you can make notes with the stylus and have your phone instantly change those notes into text on the screen. The future is here!</p>
<h2>Things to Note: Summary</h2>
<p>The Note series phones have come a long way in recent years and they are now more useful than ever.</p>
<p>While the Note 9 phone brought the line forward in great leaps and bounds &ndash;&nbsp;adding the brand new style S-Pen &ndash;&nbsp;the Note 10 has only furthered this vision.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 was a stellar phone and one that has a range of seriously enticing features. Highlights included the new S-Pen and a more seamless brand ecosystem.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the latest version of the phone is a step up. With a&nbsp;remarkable design, an improved camera and a better S-Pen, it&rsquo;s ahead of the game.</p>
