<p>Picture the scene. You&rsquo;re sitting in a cosy little cinema, popcorn in hand, watching the latest blockbuster flick. The movie&rsquo;s just about reaching its climax - you know, the guy&rsquo;s about to get the girl, or the hero is about to save the world. Either way, you&rsquo;re on the edge of your seat&hellip; and then, you hear it. Someone&rsquo;s phone starts buzzing behind you. Are you kidding me!?</p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s nothing more irritating than someone interrupting your favourite film with the sound of their smartphone going off. We&rsquo;ve all witnessed it, and had to stare staggers at the guilty culprit who forgot to turn their phone off.</p>

<p>Well, very soon this - one of life&rsquo;s littlest annoyances - will be a thing of the past. According to a leak from Sonny Dickson (a serial Apple leaker), the next iOS update (iOS 10.3) will have a &lsquo;Theater Mode&rsquo; for just this occasion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theater mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href="https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/814931454828412929">December 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to believe Dickson, the next Apple update, iOS 10.3, will be available mid-January and will feature a popcorn icon in the Control Center. All users will have to do is tap the icon when they enter the cinema to seamlessly switch to the mode. It all sounds so easy, right?</p>
<p>Despite Dickson&rsquo;s claims, AppleInsider has a rather different take on what the popcorn icon means for users. The renowned Apple analysts say that the mode will be &lsquo;iPad centric&rsquo;, presumably meaning that it won&rsquo;t be relevant for iPhone users at all.</p>
<h2>So What Does 'Theater Mode' Do?</h2>
<p>Once available, Theater Mode could offer some dramatic changes for regular cinema-goers. AppleInsider is claiming it&rsquo;ll &ldquo;disable system sounds and haptic feedback, block incoming calls and messages and reduce initial screen brightness during a movie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What that means is that cinema disturbances will be down to an absolute minimum. No texts, incoming calls or screen glare. In theory, using your iPhone or iPad in the cinema will be a lot less off-putting for the people around you, leaving them to enjoy their movie in peace.</p>
