<p><span class="postStandFirst">People have been lukewarm to the idea of smartwatches up until now, but a new initiative by Google looks like it might change all that. It&rsquo;s called Android Wear, and it aims to bring about a revolution in wearable devices.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2883/13290543053_a53fb69106.jpg" width="500" height="491" /></p>
<p>There's considerably more to it than Google releasing just their own smartwatch; instead, Android Wear will be a whole&nbsp;<em>platform</em>, dedicated to making&nbsp;<em>true&nbsp;</em>smartwatches and other genuinely smart wearable devices, in that it looks like one of the primary goals of the project is to untether the watch from the smartphone, turning into a standalone smart device.</p>
<p>To do this, Android Wear has tight integration with Google Now, and it seems that part of the core experience involves that always listens, in the same way as the Moto X constantly waits for its owner&rsquo;s voice. In essence, you interact with your Android Wear-powered smartwatch, whatever model it may be, simply by talking to it, without even having to touch the watch at all.</p>
<p>While there are still some issues that need sorting out, to make the smartwatch experience worthwhile (such as battery life), Android Wear is a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;step in the right direction, and it&rsquo;s already been announced big name manufacturers like HTC, LG and Motorola have signed up to use the new platform.</p>
<p><strong>Plus, of course, smartwatches are just the beginning. Android Wear, as a platform, will not end with smartwatches, and instead, will become the basis for a whole new class of genuinely smart wearable devices. We cannot wait to see where this story leads!</strong></p>
