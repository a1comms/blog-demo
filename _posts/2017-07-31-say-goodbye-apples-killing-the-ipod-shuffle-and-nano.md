<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, Apple has always been the go-to brand for music devices. If you want apps, internet capabilities, and an impressive design, it's all about iPod touch. But what if you want something simpler than that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where iPod Nano and Shuffle have always come into play. Since 2005, these MP3 devices have been at the very height of minimalist, easy-to-use tech. It&rsquo;s been an epic 12 years for music lovers around the globe, but sadly, those days are now over.</p>
<p>That's because Apple has now discontinued its two smallest iPods, and will no longer sell through official Apple vendors. The guys at Apple have said that this is the brand &lsquo;simplifying&rsquo; its product range, meaning that you can only get the larger, iPod Touch.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_14515" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-14515 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dY1ZxggHVTGpTR9bcfHyefvbx9n39Zr1Xe4ruaz3fy3hFno3nk-zSC-Gvq8EqcmrmheCy-2D33Oh2O-T0PVpLPTDvQ=s0" alt="" width="600" height="400" /> Here lies iPod Nano[/caption]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we are simplifying our iPod line-up with two models of iPod touch, now with double the capacity starting at just $199 and we are discontinuing the iPod Shuffle and iPod Nano,&rdquo; an Apple rep told Business Insider as the news of the change broke.</p>
<p>It really is the end of an era in terms of tech. For a long time, these two tiny gadgets were the only iPods that were simply MP3 players. Now that they're gone, it means that the only type of iPod left is pretty much an iPhone. So if you want something more basic, it's time to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not such a big dramatic change we&rsquo;re seeing here, and it&rsquo;s by no means completely unexpected. Back in 2014, the powers at Apple decided to do away with the iPod Classic; a gadget which, some would say, was the most iconic symbol of the brand at the time.</p>

<p>So, why would Apple do that? Well, the answer is no great mystery. The reason Tim Cook gave at the time was that demand for such devices was disappearing, since most smartphones had the same functionality. Logical.</p>
<p>Now when you walk into any given Apple store, you&rsquo;ll no longer see these colourful little devices on display. Oh, how the times are changing!</p>
