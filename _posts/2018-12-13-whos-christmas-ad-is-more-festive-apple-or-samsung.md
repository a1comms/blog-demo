<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Let the battle for the most heart-wrenching advert commence!</span></p>
<p>Nothing says yuletide like an advert that brings you down to a whimpering mess. As the big day is just around the corner, some of the biggest brands have already started to release its 2019 Christmas adverts. Of course, two of the most anticipated commercials come from the likes of Apple and Samsung. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each.</p>
<h2>Samsung: &ldquo;If You Can&rsquo;t Be Together, Be Together&rdquo;</h2>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t get ridiculously sentimental over the festive season, when can you, am I right? With this year&rsquo;s Christmas advert, Samsung has tapped into that notion. Sporting the tag line, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t be together, be together,&rdquo; the 2019 advert encompasses the idea of using technology to stay as close as possible over the holidays.</p>
<p>The video opens with a young girl heading out of her home. On the way, she picks up a small smartphone-shaped box and unwraps it to find a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Surprise!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19668" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SROxCFE-2KNmXn6WEkE4L64wZS6ULx2k77eVPryWd2jB8-66_4GLnnsfkBHpVRB9Hj9hcBwUfN3kesZQ2vUyQW_xqg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The present was presumably given to her by her parents and she later sends them a quick snapshot of her and her class using it. The Christmas advert then goes on to show a whole variety of people using its smart devices to stay in touch. It&rsquo;s all very wholesome.</p>
<h2>Apple: &ldquo;Share Your Gifts&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Playing with the idea of what a gift is, the Apple Christmas advert takes a different approach. The animated story centres on a young woman who is an avid illustrator. Sadly, she&rsquo;s too shy to show anybody her artwork and, instead, locks them all away in a box.</p>
<p>Throughout the advert, we see her delving into creative whims here and there &ndash; making a face out of bread at the bakery where she works and doodling on windows.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19589" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x-FZGCfzlG3wWGurCaAawKucmzTHuIqrixy6BatJyJ1-SPOs8mZbc0VUjKQEdU3m2fFmyDRc29cCnchb25wJzmc=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The story comes to a close when the pictures get blown out of the window and the woman runs down to the street to chase them. As she does so, she finds that the people in her neighbourhood have already picked each of them up and are smiling appreciatively. The tagline is short and sweet &ndash; &ldquo;Share your gifts.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a heart-warming message.</p>
<h2>But, Who's Has the Edge This Year?</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve watched both of the festive films&hellip; whoops, I mean adverts&hellip; it&rsquo;s time to make a serious decision. Which of them is the most Christmassy? If you&rsquo;re having trouble deciding, here&rsquo;s a quirky way to make up your mind.</p>
<p>Grab a box of tissues and start watching. When you&rsquo;re done, count how many tissues you used while watching each advert! The one with the biggest stack of used Kleenex takes this year&rsquo;s crown. Simple.</p>
