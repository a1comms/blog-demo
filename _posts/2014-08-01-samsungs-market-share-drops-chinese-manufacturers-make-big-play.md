<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b></b><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has experienced a slump in market share compared to last year, and the factor that seems to have caused it is the meteoric rise of Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Lenovo. This is good news indeed for those Chinese manufacturers, who are becoming a major force in the mobile world, but what can Samsung do to turn the situation around?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4752" alt="Samsung " src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" width="576" height="587" /></p>
<p><b></b>The mobile world is an ever-changing and shifting thing, which is part of what makes it so exciting; one day a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S5 might be king of the hill, but the next, it might be knocked off its pedestal by the LG G3, for example, or the HTC One M8.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much the same story in the &ldquo;manufacturer league tables&rdquo;, as it were, because according to IDC, the rise of Chinese manufacturers has caused the market share of industry leader Samsung to slump.</p>
<p>Looking at the figures, it appears that Samsung&rsquo;s market share has dropped from 32.3% last year, to 25.2% now, representing a &ldquo;negative growth&rdquo; of -3.9%. At the same time, Chinese manufacturers Huawei and Lenovo have experienced considerable growth compared to last year; Huawei has been particularly successful, with a market share that now stands at 6.9%, and while that may not seem like a big figure, it represents a massive <i>95.1%</i> year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>This huge growth, in Huawei&rsquo;s case, is put down to the company&rsquo;s focus on increasing its global reach, as well as the fact that Huawei&rsquo;s mid-range phones are really nice (even giving the fantastic Moto G a run for its money).</p>
<p>The biggest opportunity for Samsung, now, is to increase its momentum in markets &ldquo;dominated by local brands&rdquo;, which is another way of saying that the company needs to become more competitive in China, where the likes of Huawei perform much more strongly.</p>
<p><b>Nonetheless, Samsung retains one of the largest portfolios of smartphones in the industry, so there is ample opportunity for the Korean manufacturer to claw back that market share. Stay tuned for more news. </b></p>
