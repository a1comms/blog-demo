<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">Apple has announced a record-breaking 4 million pre-orders for the two new iPhones. While we don&rsquo;t have a like-for-like launch to compare this one to (as this year has seen the launch of two iPhones, with two different screen sizes), this is still a major achievement for the Cupertino giant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5248" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus.jpg" width="448" height="672" /><span class="caption">Image: iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus out sell any other iPhones upon launch, courtesy of apple.com</span></p>
<p>The buzz around the launch of the two new iPhones has been intense; it seems as if everyone has had an opinion about the double-header that is the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phone-upgrades/apple/iphone-6-16gb-grey">iPhone 6</a> and <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phone-upgrades/apple/iphone-6-plus-16gb-grey">iPhone 6 Plus</a>, and the internet has exploded with discussion of the two phones, in the past week.</p>
<p>And now, we have some idea of how much that buzz will translate into <i>sales</i>; according to an Apple press release on Business Wire, a record-breaking 4 million people have pre-ordered Apple&rsquo;s new superphones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible achievement, especially when one considers that these figures are from the first 24 hour period after pre-orders went live, although excitement does need to be tempered by the fact that those 4 million pre-orders are spread across <i>both</i> the iPhone 6 <i>and</i> the iPhone 6 Plus. As such, and since Apple did not release pre-order figures for last year&rsquo;s iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s (some people have theorised this might be because those two phones had fewer pre-orders), we have no like-for-like comparison with a previous &lsquo;two-iPhone&rsquo; launch.</p>
<p>However, we <i>do</i> know that in 2012, the iPhone 5 saw 2 million pre-orders in its first 24 hours (compared to 1 million units of the iPhone 4s in 2011). So, with today&rsquo;s announcement of 4 million handsets pre-ordered, at least <i>one</i> of the two new iPhones has beaten that 2012 record.</p>
<p><strong>All in all, this is a remarkable achievement, and it is perhaps a testament to how much demand there was for an iPhone with a bigger screen. In either case, congratulations to Apple on breaking another record! </strong></p>
