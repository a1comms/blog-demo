<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This delightful desktop wireless charger from IKEA is perfect for your iPhone 8 (and eventually iPhone X).</span></p>
<p>Move over USB chargers of the past &mdash;&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a new craze in town! With the release of <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, and the upcoming iPhone X, so comes a new way for Apple fans to juice up their iPhone. Yes, for the first time ever, iPhone users can enjoy wireless charging.</p>
<p>Many restaurants and bars already have Qi (iPhone compatible) chargers fitted. For example, selected McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants now have charging pads dotted about, so you can fill up on power while you fill up on fries.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15141" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qgoE2GkWFDNrHBN-RuoJzJG3Zclju-adSLIkSCzwZ5E3Hicz0yoMzUlmHA-I6GRoMBcWw9MEqIxmAewILq9uBg7g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But what about at home? That&rsquo;s where IKEA comes in. The ultra cool, Scandi store has released the RIGGAD; a lamp that doubles as a wireless charger for your iPhone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, the time is here when iPhone owners can make use of the multi-functional RIGGAD &ndash; your phone&rsquo;s favourite lamp - IKEA spokesperson.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, the savviest among us will note that IKEA has been selling wireless chargers for a whole two years now. However, this is the first piece of furniture that new iPhone models are fully compatible with.</p>
<p>Before now, if you wanted to charge your iPhone (or other smartphone that doesn't support wireless charging) on a lamp, you had to invest in IKEA&rsquo;s own VITAHULT phone case. Stick your phone in it and place it on a wireless charger to power up. Clever, yes. But certainly not stylish or convenient.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15149" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Y0FFLt7abcazK2OKAPeNT49Pkiub4hqwo59QawT4Ml_GrAapbaFua10cj064slw3N0oDOVOm52pEQS5742izwi1nA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While the gadget is still available for older iPhone models, there's simply no need with an iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X. Just place it on the charging pad, and you're good to go.</p>
<blockquote><p>IKEA has been very progressive with wireless charging, and we are thrilled that new iPhone owners finally can make use of one of the most powerful lamps we&rsquo;ve ever made - Creative Director at IKEA Creative Hub, Morten Kj&aelig;r.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this all sounds too good to be true, we have some rather excellent news for you. You can get the device right away online. Yes, the RIGGAD LED work lamp is available at <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/lighting/work-lamps/riggad-led-work-lamp-w-wireless-charging-art-20280684/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA stores for &pound;49</a>. The future is bright&hellip; the future is a lamp!</p>
