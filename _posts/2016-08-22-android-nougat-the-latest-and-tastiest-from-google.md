<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">UPDATED 22/08 - Google asked, and the public answered. Android N is officially named Android Nougat. And it might be heading to your mobile this week.</span></p>
<p>Announced only last month in July, the latest update to Android tablets and phones looks set to begin rolling out sooner than we first thought.</p>
<p>Officially unveiled as Android 7.0 Nougat, we&rsquo;re anticipating one of Google&rsquo;s sweetest releases yet. There are lots of reasons why we think you&rsquo;ll love it, but seven in particular stand out for us, including the new menu that lets you handle notifications like a boss.</p>

<p>Before we get on to Android Nougat's many wonderful features, first thing&rsquo;s first. When can you download it?</p>
<h2>Android 7.0 Nougat Release Date</h2>
<p>Android Nougat is in the final stage of preparation, and early adopters have already been running a stable build as part of the Nexus Beta test.</p>
<p>According to online sources, Google will begin rolling out an official, public version of Android 7.0 Nougat the week commencing 22<sup>nd</sup> August.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet clear precisely which Android mobile phones will be the first to receive Nougat, but it&rsquo;s very likely that Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P will be among them.</p>
<h2>When Can I Update My Android Phone?</h2>
<p>As is tradition, Google will likely seed Android 7.0 to its Nexus phones first. Thereinafter, it&rsquo;s down to manufacturers like <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> to prepare the latest software for their own smartphones, which naturally means some sort of delay.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, newer flagship phones, like <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a>, are first in line. Or at least they have been for previous updates, as it&rsquo;s in the manufacturer&rsquo;s best interests to look after its&nbsp;most popular devices.</p>
<p>According to Yibada, HTC&nbsp;has confirmed that HTC 10, One A9 and One M9 will all receive the latest version of Android, though no date is quoted. Likewise for <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/moto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moto</a>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s G4 Plus.</p>
<p>The same source also claims that <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/lg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG</a> has declared a limited preview program for Korean LG G5s from 22<sup>nd</sup> August. And the upcoming LG V20 flagship is reported as running on Android Nougat from launch. An official announcement is expected on 6<sup>th</sup> Sepetember.</p>
<h2>How to Update to Android 7.0 Nougat</h2>
<p>You can quickly check if there are any software updates available for your Android phone, by heading to Settings > About Phone > Software Update (or similar setting labels).</p>
<p>If Android 7.0 Nougat is available to download, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to do so. Confirm and you&rsquo;re on your way to getting all of Android's sweet, new features. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>

<h2>Handle Notifications Like a Boss</h2>
<p>As with every new version of Android, Nougat has received a number of UI improvements, tweaks implemented to assist rather than hinder, and none more apparent than the drop-down quick-menu.</p>
<p>Drag this&nbsp;menu down from the top of the screen and it becomes clear that Google has designed it&nbsp;to give a much simpler and much quicker approach to controlling core functions, such as toggling WiFi, Bluetooth and other settings.</p>
<p>Alongside the drop-down menu is the notification system, which pops up on screen in a card format, and now allows you to quickly respond straight from the alert itself. These notifications stack nicely on top of each other when you receive more than one, giving easy access to messages, emails and app notifications.</p>
<h2>Increase Your Productivity</h2>
<p>This is a much-needed feature that some manufacturers already implement in their own UX. Multi-window allows you to multi-task like a pro, with the ability to run two apps side-by-side on the screen.</p>
<p>This feature is perfectly suited to larger screened handsets, like Moto X Style&nbsp;and Sony Xperia XA Ultra, where you have more room to balance two different apps at the same time.</p>
<p>As part of this change, Google has also built in a quick-swap feature that lets the user jump in and out of tasks faster than ever.</p>
<h2>Out-Game the Noobs</h2>
<p>Another new addition to the platform is support for Vulkan API. This software is designed to replace OpenGL and allow your device to transform into a true gaming machine.</p>
<p>Vulkan API improves performance of the GPU, and makes graphics sharper, run faster and hold more stably. It also improves the VR experience and will make cross-platform gaming simpler in the future.</p>
<h2>Escape Reality Like Never Before</h2>
<p>The search giant&rsquo;s VR journey started with Google Cardboard, but that&rsquo;s soon to be superseded by a new, improved and a truer VR experience.</p>
<p>Introducing Android Daydream, Google&rsquo;s updated VR platform that offers a propriety Virtual Reality UI. The main function of Daydream is to bring in a standardised approach to VR; this means that it&rsquo;ll make discovering and consuming VR content much smoother and easier, and thanks to an ultra-low 20ms latency, all this content will be super-slick and bring VR to mobile in a new and exciting way.</p>
<h2>Watch While You Play (no, not in a creepy way)</h2>
<p>This neat function is more suited to tablets and Android TV, allowing you to pin a video on the screen, so you can watch whilst continuing with other actions.</p>
<h2>Use Apps Whilst They Update</h2>
<p>In Android Nougat, Google is introducing seamless updates that will enable two system images to run simultaneously, essentially allowing you to update an app in the background whilst you're using it. In other words, you won&rsquo;t have to come out of the Facebook app whilst it updates, just continue browsing until you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<h2>FaceTime and iMessage for Android</h2>
<p>Although technically not a feature in Android N, we thought we would mention these. Google&rsquo;s new messaging and video calling apps are set to uniform simple and effective messaging and revolutionise video calling. As these will be apps, they will be cross-platform; basically they&rsquo;re Google&rsquo;s answer to iMessage and FaceTime, but more universal.</p>
