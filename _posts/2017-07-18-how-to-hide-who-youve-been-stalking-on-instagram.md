<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s okay &mdash;&nbsp;we <em>all </em>do it!</span></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Instagram for if not stalking people? You might pretend that you simply use the site to share your highly-filtered food photos, but there&rsquo;s more to it than that, right?</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re done updating your own personal profile, your fingers start twitching. You know it&rsquo;s wrong, but it just feels so right. You type in a name, hit &lsquo;search&rsquo;, and start delving deep into a profile. And we all know that terrifying feeling of accidentally double tapping a photo weeks in&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14391" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ey_5m7amfFi85mSzXrAQVdQmKbssB3yOBdR8OeWQE6nolh9WaTU1aPOGusjblWVh_CkYRqfTUWKyBRRF-kJgyQjq2w=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem with your stalking habits (other than the dreaded accidental <em>like</em>)&hellip;</p>
<p>Should someone get their mitts on your phone and open the Instagram app, they&rsquo;ll be able to find out your deepest, darkest secrets. The last thing you want anyone to know is what a creepy stalker you really are. So, before that utter tragedy happens, here&rsquo;s what you need to do&hellip;</p>
<h2>Clear Your Search History</h2>
<p>The first (and perhaps most obvious) step is to clear your search history. This is much easier than you might imagine. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p>1) Open your profile on the Instagram app.</p>
<p>2) Go to the settings button (a gear on iOS or three dots on Android).</p>
<p>3) Tap Clear Search History.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14390" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w5ttMCYiRJzt1o1hpnISauEMFe7njd4nC6MN0OUA0IfEfFYS8sZ7z5rYn-j0Yglkr71rucAQkwnePLJPuhWkY6MC=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>You should be aware that when you do this, you&rsquo;ll also alter your search preferences, i.e. you won&rsquo;t get suggested searches based on the person that you&rsquo;ve been stalking. And maybe, just maybe, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<h2>Hide Suggested Accounts</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re <em>constantly </em>looking at the same account, you might notice a worrying trend. Yes, when you go to search for something else, you&rsquo;ll see that this account is a suggested one. Busted!</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s an easy way to deal with just that issue &mdash; say hello to the &lsquo;Hide&rsquo; button. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<p>1) Go to the search tab and click on the search bar.</p>
<p>2) Long tap the search that you would like to hide.</p>
<p>3) Tap Hide.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve hidden the search suggestion, you won&rsquo;t ever see it again. So, if someone gets hold of your phone, they won&rsquo;t instantly know who you&rsquo;re 100% obsessed with on Instagram. All together now&hellip; Phew!</p>
