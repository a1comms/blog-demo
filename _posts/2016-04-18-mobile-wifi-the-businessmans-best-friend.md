<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Working out of office, on the road, or somewhere public? You <em>need</em> mobile WiFi.</span></p>
<p>Keeping connected is paramount for the modern businessperson.</p>
<p>And such is the fast-paced and transient nature of their lifestyle, access to a fast and reliable Internet connection is not always easily achieved.</p>
<p>When out of office, be it a train journey, caf&eacute; or airport, you&rsquo;ve no doubt experienced the frustration of languid public WiFi speeds, or, more often than not, a complete absence of it altogether.</p>
<p>Relying on public WiFi is a schoolboy mistake that smart a businessperson shouldn&rsquo;t make, especially when there&rsquo;s such an obvious and effective solution, in the form of <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-wifi">mobile WiFi</a>.</p>
<p>A mobile WiFi modem is essentially a small, pocket-friendly device that connects you to the internet, wherever you need to, and whenever you want to.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10154" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/EE-Mobile-WiFi-public.jpg" alt="EE Mobile WiFi public" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>Like mobile phones, they come with a data allowance from one of the big networks, like EE, and allow you to connect up to 10 of your WiFi-enabled devices to it, such as your computer or tablet.</p>
<p>But mobile WiFi is a much better solution that tethering to your mobile, because it means you don&rsquo;t kill the battery or eat into its data allowance.</p>
<p>Plus, tethering to your mobile can restrict its core functions, like calling and texting, which isn&rsquo;t ideal if you&rsquo;re on the clock and need to be in touch with clients or colleagues.</p>
<p>Mobile WiFi eclipses public WiFi too, as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine. On an EE tariff you can experience blistering 4G internet speeds across 95% of the UK, and double 4G speeds in over 80%. Public venues just can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>The more cautious businessperson might be weary of relying on public WiFi not just for speed, but for security too. And they&rsquo;d be right to. As computer safety experts <a href="http://home.mcafee.com/advicecenter/?id=ad_ms_htkympsfwft&amp;ctst=1">McAfee explain</a>, open WiFi networks can &ldquo;compromise your security and put your information at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s pretty evident than neither tethering to your mobile, nor the precarious network of public WiFi spots, are the answer to keeping you, the transient businessperson, connected on your travels. The only logical answer is <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-wifi">mobile WiFi</a>.</strong></p>
