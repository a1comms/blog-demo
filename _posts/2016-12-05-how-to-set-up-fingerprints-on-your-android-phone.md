<p>Android smartphones with a fingerprint reader are generally more secure, and much quicker at buying items (using <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/android-pay-arrives-in-the-uk-heres-how-to-set-it-up" target="_blank">Android Pay</a>) and confirming downloads. Lots of apps support your fingerprint as way of logging in or authorisation, like the main banking apps for example.</p>
<p>We promise that once you get your Android phone set up with your fingerprint, you&rsquo;ll question how you ever lived without it!</p>

<p>Of course, to register your unique print with your Android mobile, you&rsquo;ll need a device with a fingerprint scanner. Almost all the top and middle-tier smartphones have one, but you should check anyway. The easiest way to do that is by visiting <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net">www.buymobiles.net</a>, locating your Android mobile and viewing the specifications using the <em>Full</em> <em>Spec</em> tab.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Fingerprint</h2>
<ol>
<li>To get started, head to your Settings menu. Here, you&rsquo;ll have a setting category called &ldquo;Lock screen and security&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Security.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Next, select the &ldquo;Fingerprints&rdquo; option followed by &ldquo;Add fingerprint.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The subsequent screen may present some information on fingerprint security. After you&rsquo;ve read that, you&rsquo;ll be required to add a back-up code in case your scanner can&rsquo;t recognise your print. This code might be a <em>pattern</em>, <em>pin</em> or <em>password</em>.</li>
<li>With your back-up code in place, you&rsquo;ll finally be able to set up your fingerprint on your Android mobile. Animated instructions will guide you through it, instructing how and where to place your finger. Once you complete the set-up, you can register more fingers by selecting the &ldquo;Add another&rdquo; option.</li>
</ol>
<p>With your fingerprint, or <em>prints</em>, now registered, unlocking your device, authorising purchases and initiating downloads is as simple as holding your digit to the scanner.</p>
<p>If your Android smartphone doesn&rsquo;t feature a fingerprint reader, perhaps it&rsquo;s time for an upgrade? <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/contract-mobile-phones" target="_blank">We can offer you plenty that do</a>.</p>
