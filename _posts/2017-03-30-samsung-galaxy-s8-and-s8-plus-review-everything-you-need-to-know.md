<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The most powerful Android phone that's all screen.</span></p>
<p>Finally, the phones that we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for have been revealed. Yesterday, we saw the announcement of Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Well, the reviews are in and we can finally spill the beans on these handsets. Here&rsquo;s what you most certainly need to know.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBuyMobiles%2Fvideos%2F1537741376236916%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Design: Edge to Edge Screens</h2>
<p>Samsung isn&rsquo;t letting go of its &lsquo;edge to edge&rsquo; screen efforts anytime soon. And thank goodness for that, because both the Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus sport this feature; each is almost totally bezeless. The effect on both handsets is that the screen appears to curve right around the edge of the phone in a continuous flow, almost like an infinity pool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13605" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qaK0o_D4CsWA04WHWPFZQBRwAwsaig8w-eaxCzMoH99dk_ydEQ6jk5F_jEGllM0RC_2iozbmz_-39nVX-mdcc6VR=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The home button is a thing of the past, at least in its physical form. Samsung has instead implemented a sleek interface that renders a set of digital buttons when you need them. This made room for more screen, without the need to increase handset size, and without compromising on the functionality.</p>
<p>While the Galaxy S8 comes in a standard and Plus version, both editions have generously big screens, again, made possible by removing the physical home button. The S8 has a 5.8-inch screen, while the Galaxy s8 Plus has a slightly larger 6.2-inch screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13606" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Rxn_bT7ITR5WOj538MHbRxY9Vn68uKQgDJ4xCMqQ2i0FXPBJ8i0kdhYaZWa41rJKSggK_XANxNItDo5iBTFLI1Vh=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fingerprint scanner gone?&rdquo; we hear you ask. With the home button removed, Samsung relocated the scanner to the back on both the S8 and the S8 Plus. It doesn&rsquo;t feel as natural to use, but it&rsquo;s a fair trade-off for that extra screen space.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to use the fingerprint scanner. There&rsquo;s something much cooler, in the form of an iris scanner. By holding your Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus up to your face when you want to unlock it, the device will scan your irises for authentication. Yes, it&rsquo;s like a snazzy gadget from a Bond movie. But if you don&rsquo;t want to use it, there&rsquo;s still the tried and tested pattern, password or pin method.</p>

<h2>Display: Bigger and Much Better</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Samsung has focussed on developing the greatest display ever over the years. And, it shows. The so-called &lsquo;Infinity Display&rsquo; is the jewel in the crown that is Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. This is clearly where the tech giant wants to show off its skills, with both boasting a QHD resolution for a phenomenal amount of clarity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13608" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6aI5IfsSXZZ7RfQEc_4cbmXQYeBbnu4U-QHmA6-nUq9rLx1hs0llQWDlGHZngBCs-R4uko9pkAFf4eFNnPBF_eLp0Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Plus version of the phone packs a massive 2960 x 1440 with 529 pixels per inch, which is a display like no other. Both have an impressive 18.5:9 aspect ratio so get the 'whole scene on your screen.'</p>
<p>Where both smartphones also excel is the VR department. They can be used with one of Samsung&rsquo;s Gear VR headsets for a clean, crisp and immersive experience should you be interested.</p>

<h2>Camera: Superior Selfies</h2>
<p>By the looks of things, with so much focus on improving the design and display, not a lot has changed in the camera department. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily a negative observation, because it&rsquo;s already a fantastic feature.</p>
<p>Both Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus come with a 12MP sensor and an f/1.7 aperture that promise to take bright and clear photos, as well as 4K video footage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13612" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/faibKRW0BrcD27lVPi7aiLUg7_vU5VSH4sdsDAcPVhp5UtTDiWabErAN2bZ2aBbYogl84Xush6UAq8Ai9g3IiGI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>They also come with a new multi-frame image feature. Essentially, when you take a photo, it snaps three in quick succession and selects the best quality one for you. Also, both devices house an upgraded 8MP front-facing camera, which makes for the perfect high-quality selfie. Nice!</p>
<h2>Performance: More Powerful Than Ever</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another area where Samsung really has upped its game. The Plus has an 10nm octa-core chipset, and the smaller Galaxy S8 comes with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset or the Exynos 8895 depending on your market. The tech company has kept relatively quiet about the actual chipsets of each device, although both seem extremely powerful. All of the latest games and apps will run like an absolute dream.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13614" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tPB7ZAZtrQlvLjPlDbgWpE_aKdE2mFSfzWTyfXgZkxJln6AXrMyrdL1h3vWUyRTn5HFTmxIAB3u174gLbw4HzPj53g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Samsung is sticking with 4GB RAM, which should be plenty enough. Although, there had been speculation that the new Galaxy S8 devices would pack more. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for all your music, apps and whatever else, with 64GB of internal storage, and a further 256GB available through the microSD card slot.</p>

<h2>Surprise Extra: Bixby</h2>
<p>For a long time, there were rumours of Samsung launching its own AI. It turns out those rumours weren&rsquo;t unfounded. Right before the phones were announced, Samsung announced its new virtual personal assistant: Bixby. The obvious rival to Apple&rsquo;s Siri, Bixby has a lot to live up to.</p>
<p>Still, it has a few advantages. For example, you can control all your phone&rsquo;s features using the AI. It has an object recognition feature that allows you to point the camera at any given thing and Bixby will tell you what it is. What&rsquo;s more, Bixby can also tell you where to buy them. Genius.</p>

<h2>Price Tag and Availability</h2>
<p>Since these are Samsung&rsquo;s flagship phones, and arguable the best on the market, you&rsquo;ll have to pay flagship prices. Rather than quoting exactly what the current pre-order prices are, it&rsquo;s easier to see for yourself using the links below, as they could change.</p>
<p>>> Pre-Order Samsung Galaxy S8</p>
<p>>> Pre-Order Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus</p>
