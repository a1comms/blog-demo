<p><span class="postStandFirst">With the Moto G and the new ultra-budget Moto E, Motorola is well on its way to dominating the budget phone arena. We take a look at the two phones, to help you decide which one is best for you. Whether you want the almost top-end specs of the Moto G or the incredible low price of the supremely customisable Moto E, Motorola has the perfect budget phone for you!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4322" alt="14205481506_78cd5800e1" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14205481506_78cd5800e1.jpg" width="500" height="418" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/motorola/motorola-moto-g">Moto G</a> was a revelation when it was released, a budget phone that redefined the budget phone experience. And now, the Moto E has been unveiled, and it&rsquo;s just as much of a revelation, doing for the entry-level what the Moto G did for the mid-range.</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Basically, if you&rsquo;re looking at getting yourself a brilliant little smartphone, but you&rsquo;re working to a budget, Motorola has you covered. However, which of these brilliant budget phones should you go for?</p>
<p>Oh, and we&rsquo;ll preface this showdown by saying that it&rsquo;s not <em>actually</em> a showdown in the traditional sense. Instead, we&rsquo;ll be taking a look at what makes each phone tick, and showing off the features that make each phone perfect for their respective price ranges.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s get stuck in with the&nbsp;Moto E vs Moto G...</p>
<h2>The Case for the Moto G</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4324" alt="13739837574_27466fa471" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/13739837574_27466fa4711.jpg" width="500" height="446" /></p>
<p>The coolest thing about the Moto G, the thing that made pretty much everyone sit up and take notice, is how Motorola has managed to squeeze so much good stuff into such an inexpensive phone. There&rsquo;s the processor, for starters, a quad-core Snapdragon 400 that&rsquo;s clocked to 1.2GHz, and while that&rsquo;s not as fast as flagship phones like the HTC One M8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, it&rsquo;s still remarkably fast for a mid-ranger.</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Put it this way: that kind of processor speed would have been seen in top-end phones, as little as eighteen months ago, so seeing it in a mid-range phone is, to use an already overused word, <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>Even better than the processor is the screen, as the Moto G comes with a 720p HD screen that measures 4.5-inches from corner to corner. That bears repeating: the Moto G is a mid-range phone with a 4.5-inch 720p HD screen!</p>
<p>So, to sum up, the Moto G is amazing because it takes features we&rsquo;d traditionally associate with top-end phones, and squeezes them into the inexpensive body of a mid-ranger.</p>
<h2>The Case for the Moto E</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4325" alt="14228495064_9fe2d83620" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14228495064_9fe2d83620.jpg" width="500" height="465" /></p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>We&rsquo;ll preface the case for the Moto E by saying straight off the bat that its specs do not beat those of the Moto G; where the Moto G has a quad-core processor, the Moto E has a dual-core chip, and where the Moto G has a 720p screen, the Moto E has a 4.3-inch qHD (940 x 560 pixels) screen.</p>
<p>In terms of specifications, the Moto G is the clear winner, but to just compare the specs is to miss the point of the Moto E altogether, as it was never designed to take on its sibling in a &lsquo;spec war&rsquo;. Instead, the two phones <em>complement</em> each other, with the Moto E being the <em>ultra-budget</em> alternative to the mid-range Moto G.</p>
<p>Despite being an ultra-budget phone, though, the Moto E does have a couple of neat little features that really help it to stand out. The first is a microSD slot, allowing you to extend the onboard storage up from 4GB to 36GB (4GB internal, plus a 32GB card). The second is the fact that the Moto E uses swappable Shells on the back of the phone, letting you customise how the phone looks, to really make it your own.</p>
<p>And so, we can reach a conclusion...</p>
<p><strong>If you want a phone that will shock you every time you look at it with just how much stuff it gives you for such a low price, then grab yourself the Moto G. On the other hand, if you want a brilliantly customisable phone that costs a mere pittance to buy, and you&rsquo;re not bothered about having the best of the best specifications, then the Moto E is pretty much perfect. Whichever one you buy, though, one thing is for sure: you&rsquo;re going to be getting one amazing little smartphone!</strong></p>
