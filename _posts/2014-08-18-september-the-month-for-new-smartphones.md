<p><span class="postStandFirst">September is shaping up to be one hell of a month for new smartphones. All of the big players seem to have something in store for you, and we really can&rsquo;t wait to deliver them. So, what exactly can you expect? Come and find out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4932 aligncenter" alt="New smartphones - Apple" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/Apple.jpg" width="594" height="406" /></p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable aspects of working in the mobile industry is the sheer excitement that we find ourselves caught up in, every time we approach the different points in the year where new smartphones are unveiled. Sure, just like everybody else, we hear lots of rumours and speculation in the months leading up to the official announcements, but there&rsquo;s nothing better than finally having all of our questions finally answered.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this September is shaping up to be one of <em>those</em> months, where if we&rsquo;re not careful, we could be getting through a few extra pairs of underwear. #Excited.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, just have a look at the new smartphones for Autumn 2014&hellip;</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>First up, we&rsquo;ve got the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It&rsquo;s due to be unveiled on September 3rd, and at the risk of sounding nauseatingly cheesy, it&rsquo;s going to be pretty <em>note</em>-worthy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most surprising about the rumours, though, is that they are implying that the screen <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be any bigger than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (therefore, remaining at 5.7-inches). Its resolution, however, will most likely be higher, and possibly even up to or around the same level as the Quad-HD resolution as featured on the mighty LG G3.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, it may feature a flexible screen (possibly wrapping around the side of the body) and is almost guaranteed to come with an S-Pen. This could easily become the greatest phablet we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>In addition, Samsung is also gearing up to release the Samsung Galaxy Alpha (which has already been announced), a phone that seems determined to diverge a large torrent of business, created by the iPhone range, away from Apple. With a 4.7-inch 720p screen and a brand new design that&rsquo;s unlike any current Samsung flagship, it might just do that. If you like the sound of it, make sure you register your interest for pre-order information and updates.</p>

<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>As much as Samsung would love it, it&rsquo;s not the only major manufacturer to have hot, highly-anticipated handsets in the pipeline. Apple is, of course, also due to take to the stage (allegedly on September 9<sup>th</sup>), to unveil a new iPhone 6, or, if the rumours are true, <i>two</i> new iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t have any concrete details about the successors to the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, the consensus view is that they&rsquo;ll both have bigger screens, with one coming in at 4.7-inches and the other coming in at 5.5-inches. There&rsquo;s also said to be a new and faster processor in both variants, sapphire screens (for extra durability), upgraded 13-megapixel cameras, and much, much more. We can&rsquo;t wait to see how this one plays out!</p>

<h2>Sony</h2>
<p>This next one might surprise a lot of people, considering that the Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;was only announced earlier this year. Nonetheless, here we are, with the Sony Xperia Z3 potentially being announced in the coming month, and it&rsquo;s rumoured to be arriving alongside a new mid-range sibling, namely the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. If the rumours are true, then what we&rsquo;re likely to be looking at is an evolutionary upgrade to the current Xperia Z2 (in the case of the big sibling) and a mid-range version of the same. We&rsquo;ll be bringing you an in-depth review later this week, looking at what these two smartphones could potentially feature. Stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Motorola</h2>
<p>It seems like an age since Motorola unveiled the popular mid-ranger that is the Moto X, and the fantastic value for money smartphone that is the Moto G 4G. In fact, since their release, Motorola has even changed ownership.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s about time we had a follow-up, and fortunately, we won&rsquo;t have to wait much longer. At least according to the rumours. Next month, we may see the launch of the Moto X+1 and the Moto G2.</p>
<p>Specs are a little thin on the ground, but there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation claiming that Moto G2 will be getting a new 8MP camera (while the X+1 will be receiving an even better 12MP camera), a much faster processor, and a bigger 5.2-inch screen, bringing that &ldquo;smartness&rdquo; into true superphone territory.</p>

<h2>Nokia</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to Nokia, who is rumoured to be unveiling to new Windows Phone handset in September. There&rsquo;s the Nokia Lumia 830, which seems to borrow some of the same stylish design from the Nokia Lumia 925 and will most likely be aimed somewhere around the middle of the market. The real star of the show is likely to be&nbsp;the rumoured Nokia Lumia 1030, which is apparently the next smartphone to use the utterly mind-bending 41MP PureView camera found in the Nokia Lumia 1020.</p>
<p>Time will tell on this one, but we&rsquo;re already stocking up on extra-absorbent pants.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4927 aligncenter" alt="Nokia Event" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/Nokia-Event.jpg" width="580" height="450" /></p>

<p><strong>To round up, that&rsquo;s an awful lot of new smartphones, isn&rsquo;t it? Even if we don't see every handset that we've listed, you can bet we&rsquo;ll buzzing like a kid on Christmas Day. September is going to be an epic month, make no mistake! And who knows, there may even be one or two surprises that even <em>we</em> haven&rsquo;t heard about&hellip;</strong></p>
