<p><span class="postStandFirst">After a long period of making mid-range and budget phones, Microsoft is rumoured to finally be working on new <em>top-end</em> phones. Currently codenamed &lsquo;Talkman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cityman&rsquo;, they are also said to tie up tightly with the new version of Windows on PCs, Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6667 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/452292666-1024x669.jpg" alt="Microsoft Headquarters" width="960" height="627" /></p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft bought Nokia, the company&rsquo;s smartphone range has consisted almost entirely of mid-range and budget devices, as the software giant has been focused on building up its market share in developing markets.</p>
<p>Now, though, according to Unleash the Phones, we may finally be about to see some new top-end Microsoft Lumia phones.</p>
<p>If the rumours are true (and it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the anonymous source for those rumours <em>has</em> been correct in the past), then we can expect to see <em>two</em> new top-end Lumia smartphones, both of them codenamed after Nokia phones of olde.</p>
<p>The first is said to be called &lsquo;Talkman&rsquo;, and it will be the smaller of the two phones, with a 5.2-inch Quad-HD screen (with the same resolution as you&rsquo;ll find in, say, Samsung Galaxy S6 and the newly unveiled LG G4), and a hexa-core processor.</p>
<p>The second rumoured phone, meanwhile, is said to be &lsquo;Cityman&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;ll likely be Microsoft&rsquo;s new flagship phablet, with a 5.7-inch Quad-HD screen, and an octa-core processor. Both the hexa- and octa-core processors will be 64-bit, and both phones will supposedly come with 3GB RAM, 32GB of onboard storage (plus a microSD slot) and a 20-megapixel camera (with a <em>triple</em>-LED flash, for superior colour-reproduction).</p>
<p>At the moment, there&rsquo;s no confirmation of when (or even if) these phones will hit the market, but as they are said to tie in with Windows 10&rsquo;s new features (which allow you to receive a call on your phone, but <em>answer</em> it on your Windows 10 PC), we&rsquo;d expect them to be launched after Windows 10 goes hits the market.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll have more on this story as it develops. Stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
