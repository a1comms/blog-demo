<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Until recently, the iPod touch hadn&rsquo;t seen a makeover since back in 2015. However, all that has changed. It&rsquo;s time to get excited!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Apple just announced the release of a brand-new iPod touch model that is available right away. Yes, please! So, what should you know about the music device and is it worth the hype? Let&rsquo;s take a look at the facts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Super Light and Thin</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the design hasn&rsquo;t changed greatly, there are some nice upgrades here. Sporting a neat 4-inch Retina display, you can expect a great level of screen clarity on this device. To make matters even better, it&rsquo;s also seriously thin and light. It comes in at just 88g and 6.1mm.</p>

<h2>Massive Internal Storage</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a metalhead or a poptastic music lover, one thing remains the same: You need a whole load of storage for your tunes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The new iPod touch comes with up to a massive 256GB of storage. That means that you can store a massive music library with ease. Of course, if you choose to get an Apple Music subscription, you can also stream as much music as your heart desires (without always having to download it!).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Powerful Chipset</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aside from the storage options, the iPod touch also runs on a A10 Fusion chipset. That&rsquo;s to say that using the device is a smooth and speedy experience. Apple says that this new addition means the new iPod offers twice the performance compared to previous models. Plus, they also say that the device graphics are a massive three times better!</p>

<h2>Free Device Engraving</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Want to make your device super unique? There&rsquo;s a free way in which you can do just that. When you buy the new iPod touch, you get the option to engrave your device for free. Needless to say, you can be as creative as you want when it comes to what you write.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>New Games Subscription</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about music. If you love gaming, you should know that the iPod touch will soon boast Apple Arcade too. The subscription-based feature will give users access to more than 100 new games in one place. The service is set to launch in autumn so there&rsquo;s still a lot we don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s well worth keeping your eyes peeled for the latest updates!</p>
