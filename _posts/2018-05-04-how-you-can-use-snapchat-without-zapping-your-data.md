<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This is great news for Three customers.</span></p>
<p>Come close and listen up. We&rsquo;ve got something to tell you. Some of your favourite apps are killing your data. It&rsquo;s true. If you find yourself running of data every darn month, there could be a very simple reason for that. You&rsquo;re an app-aholic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay&hellip; It&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem. You don&rsquo;t want to have to top up your data month after month. Or limit your phone usage. Nobody has time for that. Luckily, Three has the answer. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>What is Go Binge?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17372" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/op6DzN3PZNxlGb-d-Bnq-JKXfjS0HDsol3TlSYuGv_YXgcvCxjxQDVhm49rN6WKWAduCRwbrPGS4PlLkiLzAntI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Imagine a world where you could use your favourite apps as much as you pleased without ever worrying about draining your data. That&rsquo;s exactly the world that Three has created.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.three.co.uk/go-binge/">Go Binge</a> allows you to use unlimited amounts of data on some of the most popular apps (which also happen to be the ones that use up the most, too!).</p>
<p>Your entertainment game just got a whole load sweeter. The feature includes the likes of Netflix (hello infinite binge-watching!), Apple Music, Deezer, Dave, and Soundcloud.</p>
<p>That means that you can have all the music, TV shows, and more on the go. No need to download the things you want to watch when you get WiFi &ndash; just stream them!</p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you excited, there&rsquo;s more! Three has just added a brand-new app to the line-up and we&rsquo;re pretty sure you&rsquo;re going to want to hear about it.</p>
<h2>Get Snap Happy!</h2>

<p>Yes, if you happen to be a Snapchat fan, you&rsquo;re in luck. The app has just been added to the Go Binge list, which means that you can snap away without worrying about your plan. It&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
<p>Bonus: If you&rsquo;ve got a serious Snapstreak going on, you won&rsquo;t ever have to stop for a second. You can keep that baby going on and on. Oh, and that nagging voice that tells you to quit and &lsquo;save your data&rsquo; can shut up for once. Nice.</p>
<p>Plus, if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, if you have the Wuntu app (which is exclusive to Three customers and gets you free stuff), you get an exclusive Snapchat gyro lens! Get your hands on it to take yourself into the world of Three&rsquo;s super-furry Puggerfly.</p>
