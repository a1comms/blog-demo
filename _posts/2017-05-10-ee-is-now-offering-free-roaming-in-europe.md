<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">EE&rsquo;s <em>roam like home</em> is great news if you&rsquo;re about to go on holiday!</span></p>
<p>One of the major things that we all worry about when it comes to heading abroad is the killer roaming charges we&rsquo;ll get hit with. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than coming back from your break to a massive bill from your mobile phone provider. Yikes.</p>
<p>Of course, one option would be to simply not use our mobile phones while we&rsquo;re away. At least, not to surf the net, or check our social media apps. But, let&rsquo;s be honest, no one wants that. Most of us rely on our smartphones for <em>everything</em>, from finding our hotel to figuring out where to eat. They're as essential as sun scream.</p>
<p>If you happen to be an EE customer, though, you&rsquo;re in for some <em>very</em> good news. You'll be able to use your allowance (data, calls and texts) in a whopping <strong>47 EU destinations </strong>for the sweet, sweet price of nothing at all. It sounds too good to be true, right? Well, luckily for you, EE&rsquo;s new roam like home service is totally legit. And we have all the details.</p>

<h2>When Will EU Roaming Be Free on EE?</h2>
<p>Any new or upgrade pay-monthly contract deals bought on an EE plan, from 10 May, include free roaming in the EU as standard, allowing customers to &lsquo;roam like home&rsquo; as EE puts it, effectively meaning you can use your allowance just like you would here in the UK.</p>

<p>But what if you bought an EE upgrade or new contract <em>before </em>10 May? Never fear, you'll still benefit from free roaming in the EU; you just have to wait a tad longer. Though not much, because EE will be rolling out its complimentary roam like home service to everyone else from 15 June. Just in time for your summer holiday!</p>
<h2>What Countries Are Included in EE&rsquo;s Free Roaming?</h2>
<p>You need to make sure that the place you&rsquo;re planning on visiting this summer is eligible for free roaming, of course. Luckily for you, there are quite a few&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Austria, Azores, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Canary Islands, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, French Guyana, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Guernsey, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madeira, Malta, Martinique, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus (excluding Northern Cyprus), Reunion Islands, Rom&acirc;nia, Saint Martin, Saint Barthelemy, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Vatican City (Italy).</em></p>

<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re on a snazzy 4GEE Max plan, you get free EU roaming in all 47 of the countries listed above, plus five other non-EU countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the USA to boot.</p>
<p>Not having to worry about those pesky roaming charges anymore will be nothing short of bliss. Now, you can take your phone on holiday, and use it without the usual restraint.</p>
