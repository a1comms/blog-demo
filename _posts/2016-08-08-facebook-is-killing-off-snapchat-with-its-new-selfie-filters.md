<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Snapchat's little ghost has never felt more&nbsp;appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Facebook is continuing its quest for world domination, this time it has its sights firmly set on derailing the popular picture sending social app &ndash; Snapchat.</p>
<p>Already taking the fight to Snapchat is Instagram Stories, which the Facebook-owned company launched last week.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t caught up, Instagram Stories is a new feature that allows users to create a &lsquo;story&rsquo; through a series of timed posts, which can be edited to the Nth degree. Essentially, it&rsquo;s Snapchat built into Instagram.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/177180549?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Never content with playing second fiddle, Facebook is now testing instant filter integration within its app, having acquired MSQRD (pronounced <em>masquerade</em>), the popular live filter and face swap app, earlier this year.</p>
<p>Currently trialling in Brazil and Canada, Facebook&rsquo;s MSQRD feature prompts users to open their camera within the app, to then map their face and overlay the image with snazzy effects.</p>
<p>A user could, for example, transform themselves into everybody&rsquo;s favourite superhero, the invincible, indestructible Superman. Or, if you'd prefer, a panda.</p>

<p>Facebook&rsquo;s trial is running with an Olympic Games theme, of course, with various filters including face paint, masks, messages and more on offer, all designed to spruce up your selfies. And quietly kill off Snapchat.</p>

<p>But aside from eating up all of Snapchat&rsquo;s bread and butter, reports claim that Facebook&rsquo;s motivation behind this new filter feature is to reverse a 15% drop in original content sharing. Mark Zuckerberg has promised to put &ldquo;video at the heart of all of our apps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No news as to when this feature will roll out to Facebook users around the world. But you can bet Team Snapchat isn&rsquo;t in the mood for a selfie right now.</p>
