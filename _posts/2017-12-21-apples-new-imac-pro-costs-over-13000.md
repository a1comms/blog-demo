<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here's what you get for your money.</span></p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s new iMac Pro is finally here! It&rsquo;s been a long wait since the hefty piece of tech was promised to us at the WWDC back in June, but it&rsquo;s now over.</p>
<p>The latest iMac Pro is already available to buy through Apple&rsquo;s site, and will be available in stores too. So, what do we know about it so far? And, crucially, how much will you need to spend on it?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16000" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oSPLsGGcguP9lrf4s0HIbOjg049P7CtMj3tkfmuEVcqwPNYTdzsQNvdrLo5jmWGZXJUyN78i-UGkg2AZyXl_zaZl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well, should you want the new iMac Pro in its most basic form, it will set you back &pound;4,899. For that, you get the computer itself, complete with a 27-inch Retina 5K 5120x2880 P3 display, a 3.2GHz 8-core Intel Xeon W processor, 32GB 2666MHz ECC memory, 1TB storage, Radeon Pro Vega 56 with 8GB HBM2 memory, 10Gb Ethernet and four Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that you don&rsquo;t get the sleek trackpad included in this price. That's a paid-for extra I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16001" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AvhGq6rbviEo3zAtXOSh9l86TPLXAgU35csqoEMChA2Kct-rpk-TuKUyKpXry4Oh3L6QiF8OqAZKAO-5_HAqmwt-Rw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While no one would suggest that almost five grand is small change, it&rsquo;s not as expensive as it could be. Rather than buying just one package here, there&rsquo;s the option to customise your iMac Pro beyond belief.</p>
<p>That means that you can choose which specs you want or, indeed, <em>need</em>, so that your iMac Pro is unique to whatever demands you have. You also get the option to choose an upgraded graphics card, some pre-installed software packages, and Apple&rsquo;s stylish trackpad and mouse.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15998" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w_kKLI8QbZaqkb9MxKKN_ju_ig3tU6414m00hGVpaV8gTcEHKp18-6uJbZtoz0zmwvOD-VapiT-D1aJkImP7NtE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As you might imagine, each upgrade comes with its own price tag, so the cost can soon add up. Just for a minute, let's imagine that you&rsquo;re going to have everything on the highest of specs and get all the possible extras for the iMac Pro. That&rsquo;s a whole lot of gear, by the way. So, for just over &pound;13,000 of your hard-earned cash, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d get:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.3GHz 18-core Intel Xeon W processor (with Turbo Boost of up to 4.3GHz)</li>
<li>128GB 2666MHz DDR4 ECC memory</li>
<li>4TB SSD storage</li>
<li>Radeon Pro Vega 64 with 16GB of HBM2 memory</li>
<li>The Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2</li>
<li>The VESA Mount Adapter Kit</li>
<li>Final Cut Pro (pre-installed software)</li>
<li>Logic Pro X (pre-installed software)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, once you&rsquo;ve bolted-on all the above, the iMac Pro is a seriously hardcore machine. There&rsquo;s no doubt that it will be the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the entire MacOS family &ndash; I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole point of it, right?</p>
<p>However, whether you need a machine as powerful as that is up to you. Unless you absolutely <em>need </em>every one of these extras for your work or, indeed, personal life, you can probably get away with the standard configuration option. After all, we already know that every incarnation of the tech will be rather impressive, sleek, and functional.</p>
