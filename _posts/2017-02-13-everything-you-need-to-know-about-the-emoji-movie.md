<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Will it be a load of old &#x1f4a9; or a massive &#x1f44d;?</span></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a complete messaging addict or just dabble in Facebook chat now and then, you will have come across the humble emoji. These little icons help us to express the things that we just can&rsquo;t find the words to say.</p>
<p>From a range of emotions to little pictures of objects, there is honestly a picture for almost any reference. What&rsquo;s more, the library of emojis keeps on getting bigger and bigger. Soon enough, we will likely stop using text altogether, in favour of symbols, smiley faces and poop icons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say: emojis are now a part of our everyday communication. Still, it&rsquo;s quite weird to think that someone would actually make a film about them. Apparently, Sony Pictures Animation has done just that. Yep, it&rsquo;s gone ahead and created a movie based on the little icons, aptly named &lsquo;The Emoji Movie&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>So, What&rsquo;s The Emoji Movie About?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine where the creators would go with a movie like this one, but we do know some vague points about the plot. For one thing, the action all takes place in the fictional city of Textopolis, which is supposedly located somewhere inside your mobile phone. There, we find all the best-loved emojis living in harmony together. And, of course, each emoji has just the one expression - the Angry Face is always angry, and the Laughing Face is always amused etc.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just one catch. A little emoji named Gene has an entire range of emotions, just like you or I. And his one wish is to lead a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life&hellip; in Textopolis, that means expressing one, single emotion, just like the rest of his pals. It&rsquo;s then that he teams up with Hi-Five (a hand emoji) and Jailbreak (a code breaker) to try his very best to fix himself. Hence, a wild, fun-filled adventure ensues. All sounds very metaphorical, right?</p>
<h2>Who&rsquo;s Signed up for The Emoji Movie</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13138" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/patrick-stewart-poop-emoji.jpg" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>This is certainly no B-Movie. There are actually a whole load of high profile actors voicing some of our favourite emojis. From Patrick Stewart (who will be voicing the Poop Emoji) to James Corden (playing High-Five), there are a surprising amount of big names to be found here. While the idea for the flick may sound a tad odd, it would seem that the script managed to pull more than a few A-listers.</p>
<h2>When is The Emoji Movie out in Cinemas</h2>
<p>If The Emoji Movie sounds like your kind of film, you may be wondering when you can watch it on the big screen. Well, the movie is set to hit cinemas on 4 August 2017, bang in the middle of your kids&rsquo; summer holiday. What a delightful coincidence. &#x1f612;</p>
