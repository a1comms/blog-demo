<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Check out the latest S10 rumours here!</span></p>
<p>As the new year looms, it&rsquo;s time to start getting excited about the new mobiles that 2019 will bring. Sure, there&rsquo;s bound to be a whole load, but two of the most highly-awaited new additions will be the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus</a>.</p>
<p>Rumoured to be announced at the Mobile World Congress in February 2019, there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation surrounding these devices and what they will have to offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the release of Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus will mark Samsung&rsquo;s tenth anniversary in the flagship series. With that in mind, they&rsquo;re certain to be pretty darn special.</p>

<h2>Brand New Names</h2>
<p>One of the major S10 rumours that&rsquo;s floating around right now is that Samsung will be giving each of these devices a totally new name... What?</p>
<p>Oh yes, a popular theory is that the devices may be called Samsung Rize, according to a post on the <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-rize/">tech blog</a>, Let&rsquo;s Go Digital. Since the manufacturer has applied a trademark to the names Rize10, Rize20, and Rize30, it&rsquo;s a logical leap to expect these names to be used in the near future.</p>
<h2>Corner Notch</h2>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t know all that much so far, there<em> is </em>another delicious nugget of information to be found on the internet. Have you heard about it yet? Could the Galaxy S10 feature a corner notch?</p>
<p>One supposedly leaked image posted on a Vietnamese Facebook page shows a mock-up of the device with a disguised corner notch, according to a recent report by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/09/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumor-hints-at-corner-notch/">Engadget</a>. It could merely be one of the many design ideas that the company is considering right now but it does look kind of cool.</p>

<h2>Dual-Lens Selfie Cam</h2>
<p>And then, there&rsquo;s the suggestion that there will be two camera lenses on the front of the devices, resulting in even sharper selfies. The theory stands that the lenses will allow both wide angle and standard shots. Considering that <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/could-samsung-galaxy-s10-come-with-a-huge-48mp-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung&rsquo;s selfie game is already on point</a>, this would only elevate the flagship phones to new heights. Nice.</p>
<h2>Watch This Space!</h2>
<p>Of course, none of the above have been confirmed by Samsung. They are remaining tight-lipped about the new devices until the time is right. The S10 rumours flitting around at the moment may be nothing more than mere whispers. However, it&rsquo;s still interesting to think about what the new flagships might have in store for us come the new year.</p>
