<p><span class="postStandFirst">UK consumers can now call 0800 and 0808 numbers free from both mobiles and landlines, as of 1 July.</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7285 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/19321831426_52a00f2fcb_z.jpg" alt="Woman on phone" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>The changes, brought in by new <a href="http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2013/Telephone-call-charges-to-be-made-simpler/" target="_blank">Ofcom rules</a>, affect 175 million &lsquo;Freephone&rsquo; numbers, strong-arming service providers into doing away with any costs.</p>
<p>In addition, they&rsquo;ll increase transparency surrounding landline and mobile charges for calling service numbers starting 084, 087, 09 and 118.</p>
<p>Research conducted by Ofcom revealed that callers in the UK spend a total of 250m hours calling service numbers, each year, equating to around &pound;900m in call charges.</p>
<p>Up until now, UK consumers have not been made fully aware of the costs incurred when calling service providers. Though thanks to new changes, prices will be cleared up in telephone bills, marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>From 1 July, charges for services numbers will comprise of an &lsquo;access charge&rsquo; that&rsquo;s to be absorbed by the phone company, as well as a &lsquo;service charge&rsquo; set by the company being called.</p>
<p>Telecoms companies will be responsible for fixing their access charge, and will be required to outline details in customers&rsquo; bills and at the point of signing a new contract.</p>
<p>Mobile users have previously been forced to pay for the privilege of calling 0800 numbers, adding just a pinch of irony to the term &lsquo;freephone numbers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ofcom CEO Sharon White said: "UK Calling is the biggest change to telephone calls in over a decade.</p>
<p>"Together we spend around &pound;900 million a year calling service numbers, so it's important that people understand the cost before they pick up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>"Callers will be able to see what they're paying and where their money is going."</strong></p>
