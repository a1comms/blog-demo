<p><span class="postStandFirst">Following hot on the heels of the popular BlackBerry Z10, the Q10 is a return to form for BlackBerry which sees the comeback of the QWERTY keyboard.</span></p>
<p>Featuring a sleek and slim design, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/blackberry/blackberry-q10">BlackBerry Q10</a>&nbsp;is a beautiful looking device that has a slight retro feel to it.</p>
<p>Sporting a stunning 3.1 inch Super AMOLED display, which is both crisp and vibrant, the handset showcases the attractive BB10 operating system perfectly. The return of a full QWERTY keyboard is a welcome sight and works perfectly in conjunction with BB10, allowing for quick and accurate text replication.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/blackberry_q10.jpg" width="123" height="227" />The rear of the device is very aesthetically pleasing with a minimalist carbon fibre finish. There is a very capable 8 megapixel camera unit located in the upper section of the frame which has the ability to take beautifully detailed photos.</p>
<p>Powering the device is a speedy 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, backed up by 2GB of RAM, which is fuelled by a 2100 mAh battery to keep the device ticking over nicely.</p>
<p>On the media side of things, BlackBerry has included a hefty 16GB of internal storage and has also incorporated a microSD card reader that supports up to 64GB of extra storage, meaning plenty of room for photos, music and movies.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has created the perfect QWERTY smartphone with the Q10 and the device has even been 'future-proofed' with the inclusion of the latest technologies such as 4G LTE connectivity, Near Field Communication (NFC) and an HDMI port.</p>
<p><strong>The return to form for the Canadian firm has been a long time coming, and the BlackBerry Q10 showcases exactly what it is that BlackBerry do so well. This being the integration of the best communications platform with a great balance of looks and functionality.</strong></p>
