<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here's how to protect your iPhone from the latest message prank.</span></p>
<p>Someone remotely hacking your iPhone might sound like something out of a crazy Black Mirror episode, but it could be more of a threat than you imagine. In fact, right now, there's not one but <em>two</em> hacker messages going around which could temporarily disable your iPhone. Eek.</p>
<p>Identified by a YouTuber in the video below, the first emoji prank is just a three-character-long text message, which causes your iPhone to freeze for around a minute. Luckily, the effects of this so-called prank (details below) are temporary, and your phone will return to normal after that period. Thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t work if your iPhone&rsquo;s running the latest versions of iOS.</p>
<p>So, what is this rather reckless, emoji message prank then? Well, it&rsquo;s quite simple: a white flag emoji, a numerical zero and a rainbow emoji. In that order. If you happen to be sent this message, you&rsquo;ll find that your touchscreen and home button stop working for a short period. (Don&rsquo;t panic! It shouldn&rsquo;t last too long&hellip;)</p>

<p>The second prank text, which <em>does</em> affect iOS 10, is a little more complicated. It manifests as a long string of contact information from the iCloud Drive app, and is harder to resolve since it reopens each time that you try to access your messages. Yikes.</p>
<h2>How Can You Stop These Pranks?</h2>
<p>There is some good news! The first bug is very easily avoided. You see, it only affects older versions of iOS. That means a simple upgrade to iOS 10 is all you need to protect your iPhone. Just go to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
<p>What about the second bug? Well, this one is actually more complex. It renders itself in the form of a rather long text message and can totally disable your iMessage app. That means every time you open it, the buggy message&nbsp;attempts to load and consequently crashes iMessage again and again. Oh the anger.</p>

<p>One way around this problem is to click this link (on your iPhone <em>not </em>in your browser!). Next, you need to open the link in iMessage, create a new message, and delete the text that&rsquo;s causing your iPhone to crash. That should restore your device to normal use again.</p>
<p>But what if the same person keeps sending you the prank message? Try block them, and reevaluating your friendship circles. It&rsquo;s that plain and simple. You can block a contact by tapping&nbsp;the &lsquo;i&rsquo; icon, to the right of the contact,&nbsp;then select Block this Caller. That way, you can be sure that the hacker will quit harassing you with their annoying prank messages. Phew!</p>
