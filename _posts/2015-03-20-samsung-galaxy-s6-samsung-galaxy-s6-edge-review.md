<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has gone above and beyond expectations with its eye-catching new Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge.</span></p>
<p>When I consider some of the most celebrated smartphones to have launched over the last 6-12 months, namely iPhone 6, HTC One M8 and Sony Xperia Z3, there&rsquo;s at least one very noticeable trait that they all share.</p>
<p>An unmistakable emphasis on aesthetics.</p>
<p>Samsung, who for some years has been adopting an arguably <em>less</em> aesthetically-pleasing form, fashioned from plastic, has clearly felt the pressure to capitulate to this market trend.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m more than relieved to say that Samsung finally <em>has</em>, because otherwise I might not have the pleasure of presenting to you two of the most beautiful smartphones ever created&hellip;</p>
<p>Come and meet Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge.</p>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s the biggest talking point, it seems only natural to start with Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge&rsquo;s mouth-watering design, and the elements that make up its premium composition.</p>
<p>Both handsets have been stripped down and redressed from head to toe. Where plastic was once worn, on forebears like Samsung Galaxy S5 and S4, you&rsquo;ll now find a blend of precision-cut metal and crafted glass, much like the sumptuous iPhone 6.</p>
<p>Soft edges give these new-fangled Galaxy handsets a more organic look, and the collaboration of only the finest materials oozes resplendence at every angle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6416 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy-s6-exquisitely-crafted-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Design" width="960" height="512" /></p>
<p>Galaxy S6 flaunts a profile that&rsquo;s just 6.8mm thin, and S6 edge is imperceptibly thicker at 7mm. For comparative purposes, iPhone 6 sits nicely in the middle at 6.9mm. And Samsung Galaxy S5 is noticeably wider than these at 8.1mm, but still unlikely to tear the seams of your pocket anytime soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6417 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/gallery_galaxy_s6_black_sapphire_left_02.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Profile" width="702" height="38" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power key sits on the right-hand side of each device, above the SIM tray (a pin-to-open mechanism &ndash; like <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhones</a>); the volume controls reside on the upper left-hand side; and accommodated on the top, is a microphone hole and IR sensor.</p>
<p>The base of Galaxy S6 and S6 edge resembles that of iPhone 6, with precision-drilled speaker holes (which, by the way, are 1.5x louder than the set on Samsung Galaxy S5). Positioned at the center of the foot, is a microUSB port, and just across from that, you&rsquo;ll notice a headphone port, too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6418 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/SGS6-bottom.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 edge - Base" width="847" height="320" /></p>
<p>If I had to choose between Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, the latter of the two would emerge my favourite every time. Simply for its inspired display that flows beautifully into the chassis, creating a visual effect that&rsquo;s almost akin to gazing out across an infinity edge pool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6419 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/Galaxy_S6_edge_SideBottom_Gold_Platinum_Art_Photo-1024x767.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 edge - Base" width="960" height="719" /></p>
<p>Though, it would be unwise for the two to ever come into contact, as the water and dust-resistance that Galaxy S5 features, hasn&rsquo;t, unfortunately, been passed down the line. But hey, even the most desirable characteristics sometimes skip a generation.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the microSD card slot, which has been excluded in order to accommodate the all-new unibody design. Calling that&nbsp;a fair-trade would be an under-statement, especially since both Galaxy S6 and S6 edge will be available in three different sizes: 32GB, 64GB and 128GB.</p>
<h2><strong>Display</strong></h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Samsung didn&rsquo;t confine the flow of its proficiency to design alone, as Galaxy S6 and S6 edge both house class-leading displays, with the highest pixel density of any smartphone currently available on the market.</p>
<p>Built with 577 ppi, and a resolution of 1440 x 2560, the Quad HD display on Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge is dripping in pixels. So much so, that the naked eye simply wouldn&rsquo;t be able to discern any individual ones.</p>
<p>The contrast ratio surpasses many of its competitors, resulting in brilliant whites and atramentous blacks. And adaptive technology automatically optimises the brightness level depending on ambient light.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6420 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy-s6-edge-dazzling-display-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 edge - Display" width="960" height="512" /></p>
<p>When all of these display components converge, the result is a viewing experience that is simply one of the best you&rsquo;re likely to find right now&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and LG G3 sport their own stunning Quad HD display, which echo similar visual performances, on larger platforms.</p>
<p>And not forgetting Samsung Galaxy S5, which has always been an astute choice for visuals, with a 5.1-inch Full HD 1080p display. Although it does now pale somewhat in comparison to Galaxy S6 and its edgy counterpart. But you&rsquo;d be disappointed with Samsung if it didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2>
<p>Rather than needlessly swelling the megapixel count, Samsung has instead opted for a 16-megapixel sensor with a greater emphasis on quality of results, not size.</p>
<p>It features a brand-new f1.9 aperture that permits 34% more light into shot, for more radiant results. Auto HDR guarantees that your photos look rich in colour and detail, by taking two different photos, at different levels of exposure, and amalgamating the two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6422 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-Tracking-AF.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Tracking AF" width="1003" height="431" /></p>
<p>Optical image stabilisation takes care of shaky hands and natural movement, so your pictures aren&rsquo;t tainted by slightly unsettling blurred grins. And Tracking AF (autofocus) follows faces and other moving objects accurately, without having to refocus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6421 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy_s6_edge_front_gold_03.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 edge - Tracking AF" width="926" height="681" /></p>
<p>The camera app can be launched by pressing the home button twice, and takes just 0.7 seconds to do so. Which is particularly handy if you&rsquo;re&nbsp;to capture something quickly, before the moment passes.</p>
<p>The front sensor, now 5-megapixels, also permits in more light and features Auto HDR, so your &lsquo;selfies&rsquo; &ndash; yes, a small, but significant part of me does die every time I use that word &ndash; should glow as much as your smile.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6423 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy_s6_front_black_02.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Selfie" width="677" height="688" /></p>
<h2><strong>Power</strong></h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge have the power. There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. Both are endowed with a formidable 64-bit octa core Exynos 7420 chipset that&rsquo;s considerably faster and more power efficient than Galaxy S5, as well as the vast majority of competition.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re especially into mobile gaming, this is a huge green tick for you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6424 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy_s6_edge_front_gold_08.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - 64-bit" width="993" height="381" /></p>
<p>Samsung asserts that an extra gigabyte of RAM (3GB total) delivers a minimum of 40% performance improvements in some departments. You should notice a streamlined user experience, even with a myriad of apps and services running in the background.</p>
<p>Oddly, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge pack smaller batteries than Galaxy S5 (2800mAh), at 2550mAh and 2600mAh respectively. Realistically, though, this isn&rsquo;t likely to cause too much of a concern, owing to the increased chipset efficiency.</p>
<p>For those who&rsquo;re partial to a little bit of power prudency, you can always fall back on Ultra Power Saving Mode to help conserve as much juice as you need. But thanks to the inclusion of fast charging technology, you may not have to. Just 10 minutes of charge time can refuel Galaxy S6 and S6 edge with up to four hours of usage.</p>
<p>And of course wireless charging technology means that you don&rsquo;t ever have to actually plug in.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6425 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/galaxy-s6-charging-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Charging" width="960" height="512" /></p>
<h2><strong>Samsung Pay</strong></h2>
<p>Following last year&rsquo;s announcement of Apple Pay, Samsung has unveiled its own mobile payment service, aptly named Samsung Pay. In doing so, Samsung helps usher in a new era of card-less transactions.</p>
<p>Samsung Pay functions as an all-in-one payment application, leveraging Near Field Communication (NFC) and Magnetic Secure Transmission (NST) to make purchases much easier, faster and even more secure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6426 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/Samsung-Pay.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 - Samsung Pay" width="620" height="349" /></p>
<p>Initially available in just the US and South Korea, Samsung Pay will eventually expand to other global regions, including Europe.</p>
<h2><strong>Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Samsung has shifted the trajectory of its focus with Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, and in doing so, has delivered two products that I really can&rsquo;t take my eyes off. I&rsquo;m finally seeing two Samsung Galaxy S smartphones that truly offer a first-grade performance <em>and </em>design.</p>
<p><strong>You can order&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge now.</strong></p>
