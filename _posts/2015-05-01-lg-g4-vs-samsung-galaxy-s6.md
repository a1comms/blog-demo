<p><span class="postStandFirst">The radical new LG G4 is being dubbed as LG&rsquo;s &lsquo;most ambitious&rsquo; creation to date. It&rsquo;s a bold statement, that we totally agree with. But how does it compare to the lauded Samsung Galaxy S6?</span></p>
<p>Unveiled on 28<sup>th</sup> April, LG G4 has been dominating the headlines, chiefly for its genuine leather rear cover and professional-quality camera, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dIzvyZaN4U&amp;list=PLShKiWbiCfxad3OOf9nFG6jOEp4k2p8D-&amp;index=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed by famous photographer, Colby Brown</a>.</p>
<p>Impressions thus far indicate that we&rsquo;re seeing a smartphone to be reckoned with. On paper, LG G4 looks formidable. But is it enough to outshine the resplendence of Samsung Galaxy S6, which some have already crowned best mobile phone of the year?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say. But we can say that LG has really delivered on its promise of innovation, in LG G4.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>This year, the smartphone industry is starting to see a clear, and heavily weighted focus on aesthetics. Why? Because people are no longer contented with a smartphone that has a sweet camera, glossy screen and top-drawer specs; they want all of that, but they want it wrapped up in something that genuinely <em>looks</em> desirable.</p>
<p>In LG G4, LG has achieved just that, albeit in a slightly unorthodox fashion. The device is adorned with a genuine full grain leather back cover that would quite honestly put the interior of my car to shame. The leather is entirely handcrafted, with actual threaded stitches running down the length of it. It&rsquo;s almost too awesome to be true.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6641 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/11193225_985880878089899_8880907806651338026_n.png" alt="LG G4" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>The form factor itself is shaped to a slim arch, for reasons that arrive two-fold. Firstly, the gradual curvature better fits the contours of your hand, for more natural and comfortable usability. And secondly, LG is saying that its bowed body offers 20% more durability, in comparison to conventional flat mobiles, when dropped face down.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6, on the other hand, has been taken down another route entirely, crafted from a sumptuous blend of reinforced glass and precision-cut metal. The materials boast a jewellery grade finish and iridescent shimmer, making a welcomed change to Samsung&rsquo;s former inclination towards plastic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6642" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/galaxy-s6-exquisitely-crafted-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6" width="800" height="428" /></p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 feels incredibly compact, despite the large screen, and feels impressively slim (2mm slimmer than the G4), too. The power button, positioned on the right side, and volume toggles, left side, feel like they&rsquo;re sat in the natural place. Whereas LG G4&rsquo;s reside on the rear, just beneath the camera lens. That does, admittedly, take some getting used to, but eventually feels just as practical.</p>
<p>In respect to their designs, LG G4 and Samsung Galaxy S6 are as different as the sun and the moon. But both yield uncommonly desirable looks. LG G4 probably suits those who profess a little more edge and eccentricity, whilst Galaxy S6 is arguably more of a crowd-pleaser, likely favoured by the majority.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Samsung, LG, if you haven&rsquo;t already, give yourselves a pat on the back. Galaxy S6 and the G4 are equipped with two of the finest displays on the market right now, both capable of unimaginable things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dissect LG G4&rsquo;s first, a 5.5-inch Quad HD display with a ridiculous resolution of 1440 x 2560 and 538 ppi. The more astute tech aficionados might notice that these are same numbers LG G3 operates with, which, on the face of things, sounds a little discouraging, right?</p>
<p>When in reality, the experience is on an entirely different level, owing to LG G4&rsquo;s new IPS Quantum Display. It&rsquo;s a <em>quantum</em> leap in screen technology, offering 20% greater colour reproduction, 25% more brightness and 50% greater contrast, leaving the G3 totally eclipsed by the new and improved G4.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6643" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/bg_section6.jpg" alt="LG G4 IPS Quantum Display" width="800" height="699" /></p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, is LG G4 features Advanced In-cell Technology (AIT) that combines the LCD and touch sensor to a single layer for better colour reproduction and touch sensitivity. To use a desperately hackneyed word, LG G4&rsquo;s display looks&nbsp;<em>epic</em>.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 houses a smaller 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, but similarly to LG G4, it&rsquo;s a Quad HD unit with a resolution of 1440 x 2560. It one-ups the G4 on pixel density, however, with an astounding 588 ppi &ndash; making it the sharpest display currently available.</p>
<p>Adaptive technology promises excellent visibility both indoors and out, and the display itself can be cranked up to brightness levels that could dazzle even the blindest of moles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6644" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/galaxy-s6-dazzling-display-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 display" width="800" height="428" /></p>
<p>It terms of colour reproduction, I&rsquo;d say that LG G4 offers a more authentic experience, and the added size is great for enjoying movies. Though Samsung Galaxy S6 is more convenient for one-handed use, and the sharpness of its screen is unparalleled.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>LG looks to have gone one step beyond creating a camera that surpasses its rivals, and may have just slapped an expiry date on Digital SLRs. The camera that&rsquo;s been built into LG G4 is the Korean company&rsquo;s most advanced yet, and by some distance, too.</p>
<p>So what are we working with? Well, it&rsquo;s a 16-megapixel unit, giving it a bump up from LG G3, and carries an <em>f</em>1.8 aperture lens that allows 80% more light to reach the sensor. As such, performance in poor lighting is outstanding.</p>
<p>Photos are guaranteed to look steadier than ever, now OIS 2.0 is on board. Vibrations are said to have been reduced by twice as much, making it easier to snap away whilst walking.</p>
<p>The introduction of Manual Mode will likely attract the more experienced photographers, giving them the ability to unleash their artistic creativity, by controlling aspects like focus, shutter speed, ISO, exposure and white balance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6645" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/11077332_985880351423285_2560633914775182739_o-1024x575.png" alt="LG G4 Camera Shot" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>The camera unit is speedier than ever, bragging a launch time of just 0.6 seconds &ndash; clocking the fastest time around. Thanks to LG UX 4.0, the G4 now features Quick Shot, enabling you to capture a photo by double pressing the Rear Key when the display is sleeping.</p>
<p>An 8-megapixel front camera is at your selfie service, capable of responding to hand gestures and taking four pictures in just two seconds. That&rsquo;s right &ndash; four times the selfies! What a time to be alive&hellip;</p>
<p>As expected, LG G4 gives you the camcorder capabilities to film in 2160p at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. There&rsquo;s a notable omission of slowmo, which is kind of a shame.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6&rsquo;s camera mirrors the resolution of the G4&rsquo;s, at 16-megapixels. However, its <em>f</em>1.9 aperture lens isn&rsquo;t quite as large. 0.1 in measurement may seem negligible, but it really does carry significance. Still, Galaxy S6 performs admirably in low-light, just not quite to the same standard as LG G4.</p>
<p>OIS contributes massively to creating steady shots, and a speedy auto focus ensures that precious milliseconds are never wasted. And by pressing the home button twice, you can launch the camera app in just 0.7 seconds.</p>
<p>There are copious amounts of neat shooting modes to select from, to help broaden your scope of results. Pick from Auto, Pro, Selective Focus, Panorama, Sports and more. Bokeh effect is particularly cool, allowing you to capture three shots of the same scene, then reset the focus.</p>
<p>At 5-megapixels, Galaxy S6&rsquo;s front-facing camera isn&rsquo;t quite as full of detail, but you&rsquo;ll no doubt find it a joy to use thanks to functions like wide selfie mode (for group selfies&hellip; groupies?) and beauty shot (for an eerie doll-like makeover).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6646" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/galaxy_s6_front_black_02.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 Selfie" width="500" height="508" /></p>
<p>Just like LG G4, this mobile shoots video in 2160p at 30fps, 1080p at 60fps, and <em>does </em>include the option for filming in 120fps slowmo. At 720p, the quality isn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s still fun to experiment with.</p>
<p>Both are exceptional smartphones for recording your life. But I feel like LG G4 would be a better match for the more creative types, who understand the more intricate details of photography. Whereas Galaxy S6 seems like a more appropriate choice for the majority of us, who&rsquo;re happy to leave the complicated side of things to the handset itself.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>LG G4 draws its power from a brand-new Snapdragon 808 processor, with six cores working industriously to ensure the device never falters. Accompanied by a healthy 3GB of RAM, speed is very much of the essence here.</p>
<p>Apps load quickly, and run smoothly once open; games flow without any noticeable transitions; and Internet browsing is as fluid as a gushing tap.</p>
<p>Understandably, feelings of anxiety around battery often surface with a smartphone like LG G4, induced by the potential drawbacks of a Quad HD display. However, initial impressions seem positive; its 3000mAh battery is holding up well, and can be removed and replaced if you have a spare. LG claims that the G4&rsquo;s battery will persevere up to around 20% longer than the 3000mAh battery housed in LG G3.</p>

<p>Doing things a little differently, Samsung opted for its own 64-bit Samsung Exynos 7420 octa-core processor, which is smaller and more energy efficient than the likes of the Snapdragon 810 processor.</p>
<p>That processing power, fused with a generous 3GB of RAM, gives Samsung Galaxy S6 the capacity to handle graphic-intense games, extremely proficiently, and juggle apps with more deftness than a court jester.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, the battery performance doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to the sky-high standard that we all hoped it would. But it&rsquo;s certainly not a major issue, considering just 10 minutes of charge will refuel your Galaxy S6 with about four hours of usage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6648" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/galaxy-s6-peerless-performance-desktop-1024x547.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 Power" width="800" height="428" /></p>
<p>No doubt, the seamless nature of both LG G4 and Galaxy S6 will blow you away. They&rsquo;re both highly adept at handling the rigours of the modern world, whether that&rsquo;s streaming content from the web, balancing multiple apps or fuelling your lust for addictive mobile games.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>LG G4 is free of charge from &pound;38.49 a month, which will give you unlimited minutes, texts and 2GB of 4G data on EE. You can pick the G4 up SIM free if you&rsquo;re not ready for an upgrade, costing &pound;550.99.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 will set you back slightly more, available free of charge from &pound;41.99 a month. At that price point, you&rsquo;ll enjoy unlimited minutes, texts and 2GB of 4G data on EE.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Trying to pick my favourite between LG G4 and Samsung Galaxy S6 is as unfair as asking a mother to select her favourite child. I love them both, equally.</p>
<p>However, I would say that LG&rsquo;s offering is the more radical of the two, looking towards its handcrafted leather cover and flexible manual camera controls.</p>
<p>Conversely, Samsung Galaxy S6 feels so unbelievably premium; and I love the fact that in the time it takes me to have a shower, I can pump about four hours&rsquo; worth of juice into it.</p>
<p><strong>I genuinely do feel like there is no right or wrong choice here. Pick either LG or Samsung Galaxy S6 and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a sublime piece of kit right there.</strong></p>
