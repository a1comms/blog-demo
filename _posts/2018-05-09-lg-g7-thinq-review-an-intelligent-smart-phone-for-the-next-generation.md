<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s all about the display!</span></p>
<p>LG is back in the game with another flagship phone. The South Korean giant has just launched its latest offering &ndash; LG G7 ThinQ.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pause for a moment to talk about the name. After all, you don&rsquo;t want to make a major faux pas and end up pronouncing it incorrectly, right? Well, despite how it may look (and what your mind tells you is right!), this device is not called the &lsquo;think.&rsquo; No, it&rsquo;s pronounced the &lsquo;thin-queue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve cleared that one up, let&rsquo;s get down to business. What does the phone look like? What does it offer? And, most importantly, should you bother getting it? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Specs and Features</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite clear that LG is competing with the major players in the smartphone biz. The G7 ThinQ is packed with the Snapdragon 845 chipset, which you'll find in most flagship phones right now. It also has ample 4GB RAM and an impressive 64GB of storage too.</p>
<p>All of the above means that the flagship is in line to compete with some of the most popular devices out there (we&rsquo;re looking at you Samsung, Apple, and Huawei!). The operating system is nothing to sniff at either, with the phone boasting Android Oreo 8.</p>
<p>The 3000 mAh battery isn&rsquo;t bad either (although it&rsquo;s smaller than we&rsquo;ve seen on previous devices!). We don&rsquo;t need to tell you that wireless charging is the future &ndash; LG G7 ThinQ supports it, which is a real step in the right direction. It also supports QuickCharge 3.0 wired charging, so you can juice up the device super-fast.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the latest LG flagship really excels. The G7 ThinQ touts a pretty impressive sounding &lsquo;Boombox&rsquo; speaker. That means that the whole phone is essentially a speaker, which offers a pretty hefty amount of bass.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to use your device to play music without the help of an external speaker, this could be the phone for you. It&rsquo;s basically like having a little music box in your pocket.</p>
<p>Wait, there&rsquo;s more. When you&rsquo;re using wired earphones, you can get the latest DTS:X 3D sound right into your ears. Music fans are sure to notice the significant difference here &ndash;&nbsp;the sound quality is hard to beat.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>So, how does the phone look? Well, following the current trend of ultra large screen, LG G7 ThinQ comes with a stunning 6.1-inch Super Bright LCD. The vibrant 3120 x 1440 display should mean that seeing the screen outside in the sun is easier than ever. There are some pretty nice colour options too. It'll be available in Platinum Gray, Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue, and Raspberry Rose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s solid edge-to-edge design looks impressive when you put it next to some of the best phones of our time. There&rsquo;s a small notch at the top of the device too, and supports a clean Android interface. Plus, if you head to <em>Settings > Display > New Second Screen,</em> you can pretty much hide the notch with a colourful bezel across the top of the phone (if you so desire).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a special button on the side of the phone that gives you a quick burst of AI. Press it and you'll have the likes of Google Assistant right at your fingertips. It&rsquo;s surprising that LG hasn&rsquo;t brought out its own assistant yet, but the Google offering is, of course, pretty darn good!</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>Smart cameras that use artificial intelligence to improve pictures are a hot topic right now. LG is getting in on the action. The dual-lens AI offering is a great little feature. The idea is that the phone determines what the subject of the picture is and fine-tunes the image.</p>
<p>With an 8-megapixel selfie camera and 16-megapixel dual rear camera, the device stands up against some of the top phones on the market. It also has a Super Bright Camera mode, which supposedly makes the pictures a whopping four times brighter than those from the LG G6 (of course, you do lose <em>some </em>resolution quality when using this feature!).</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t wait to get your hands on the smart G7 ThinQ, here&rsquo;s what you should know. The flagship device launched in Korea and New York last week. The word right now is that the phone will be rolled out across Europe and the UK soon enough too.</p>
<p>LG has not released the official price details of the phone just yet. The LG G6 had an initial SIM-free release price of &pound;649. So, you might imagine that the price of the G7 ThinQ could be around that mark. Still, at the moment, we can only speculate. Watch this space.</p>
