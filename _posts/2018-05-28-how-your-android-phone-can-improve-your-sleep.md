<p>When was the last time you woke up feeling refreshed and ready to face the day?</p>
<p>For most of us, that feeling is a long-forgotten one. One that&rsquo;s been replaced with a now familiar state of sluggishness, with heavy eye lids to match.</p>
<p>Personally, I know that I don&rsquo;t get the quality of sleep that I really need every night, and there&rsquo;s one not-so-obvious reason why&hellip;</p>
<h2>The Reason You&rsquo;re Not Sleeping</h2>
<p>After changing into my pyjamas and completing my evening hygiene routine, I slip into bed and do the same thing every night. I just can&rsquo;t help myself... I reach over to my bedside cabinet to pick up my smartphone, and spend a good 20-30 minutes idly scrolling through Facebook and my emails.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you are guilty of the same habit. But did you know that this bedtime activity could be affecting the quality of your sleep?</p>
<p>The bright glow of your smartphone emits what is known as 'blue light,' and it&rsquo;s likely the cause behind you being awake until the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11868" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Zach-Braff-awake-in-bed.gif" alt="zach-braff-awake-in-bed" width="600" height="250" /></p>
<p>There have been numerous <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/blue-light-from-electronics-disturbs-sleep-especially-for-teenagers/2014/08/29/3edd2726-27a7-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> into smartphones and blue light, which have concluded that this particular luminosity messes with your circadian rhythms. Essentially, blue light dupes your brain into believing that it&rsquo;s still daytime, resulting in increased alertness and decreased snoozing.</p>
<p>So, when you eventually switch your smartphone off to try and get some kip, you might just find that it&rsquo;s a lot harder than you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<h2>How to Get a Better Night&rsquo;s Sleep</h2>
<p>The easiest way to combat sleep trouble is to quit looking at your Android mobile an hour before you go to bed&hellip; But we know that&rsquo;s not the popular option, because we all love using our smartphones, whatever time of the day.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s another solution that means you can continue using your Android, and <em>still</em> get a night of deep, replenishing sleep. That solution comes in the form of an app, well, a couple of apps. What they do is filter out your smartphone&rsquo;s blue light, preventing the signal that would normally keep your brain active and alert.</p>
<p>There are few options in the Google Play app store, but our two favourites are Twilight and Bluelight Filter for Eye Care. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h2>Twilight</h2>
<p>After a quick and easy setup, Twilight will filter out your mobile&rsquo;s blue light as the sun begins to set. The resulting screen hue is red and much easier on the eyes, although a little bit odd if you&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen it before. Thankfully, the light change isn&rsquo;t abrupt; it happens so gradually that you&rsquo;re unlikely to even notice at first, helping you get used to it.</p>

<p>After your initial setup, Twilight will run quietly in the background, kicking in when required, to tone down blue light as you prepare for a night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Download Twilight for free.</p>
<h2>Bluelight Filter for Eye Care</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth considering Bluelight Filter for Eye Care as a solution to your sleepless nights. This Android app works in a similar way to Twilight, in that you can simply apply some settings and leave it to work in the background. Once the clock on your phone indicates the sun has set, Bluelight Filter for Eye Care will start gradually filtering out you know what. Rather than the red screen tinge that Twilight offers, you can choose yours.</p>
<p>Moreover, if, for example, you find yourself pulling an all-nighter, there&rsquo;s a quick way to deactivate Bluelight Filter for Eye Care, in the form of a one-click enable/disable switch.</p>

<h2>Sleep as Android</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ven-_kI2GIk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about when you go to sleep and wake up; it&rsquo;s also about the quality of sleep you ultimately end up having.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep as Android</a> comes into play. The app uses your phone&rsquo;s accelerometer to track your muscle movements (no, seriously!) and work out when you&rsquo;re awake and when you&rsquo;re asleep. It then looks at your sleep cycle and helps you tweak it so that you have the best possible night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Sleep as Android has actually been around for quite some time, and a whole load of other features have been added into the mix. It can now sync with Google Fit and S Health, as well as offering little extras such as natural lullaby sounds and sleep talk recording.</p>

<h2>SnoreLab: Record Your Snoring</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17580" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6rMWfRWteosOll8_ougO80qiCWn1WtXydaVQXu3DTSTwAZ68hKqgxXsooJAvZs4radWLJgqL-za88d14KzPb8OMWLg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Snoring is an extremely common sleep complaint that many people struggle with. Not only is this an annoying problem, but it can also interrupt your sleep more than you know. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snorelab.app">SnoreLab</a> could be the answer.</p>
<p>The first step is understanding <em>when </em>you snore so that you might get a chance to figure out what causes it. The app records (yikes!) your snoring and lets you know when it happens and how bad it was. It then gives you a Snore Score which tells you what your current rating is.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can identify the cause of the problem and make lifestyle changes to fix it.</p>

<h2>Sleep Well Hypnosis</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17581" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f25hLkMhODjk5zyG6W1IPsk6hlFcdOwwBS6ohOlw14RKRu03XaTMFn3vyn7-DP-1ufIcXzKZU71k0SPqxIG56rVe=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it: Hypnotherapy isn&rsquo;t for everyone. However, if you&rsquo;ve tried everything else and don&rsquo;t really fancy forking out loads of cash for a specialist, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.surfcityapps.sleepwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Well Hypnosis</a> app is worth a quick try.</p>
<p>The app includes an audio session from a certified hypnotherapist which promises to help you nod off in no time at all. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to ward off jet lag or just get more rest, the app&rsquo;s creators claim it could be the magic key.</p>

<h2>Digipill</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17579" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YwUJOL-L98xeAMWdGbB2h7yU9xoX1IduLcHC0HRnXqRHsZ9o9uciwc1WY8wO9WVxLkgsHWC0Nw3xMnRz9dL1xVs1=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Forget taking a pill to help you fall asleep! Say hello to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yuza.digipill.droid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digipill</a> &ndash; the technological alternative. All you have to do is enter how you&rsquo;re feeling along with some helpful information about yourself. After that, the app goes ahead and &lsquo;prescribes&rsquo; a <em>digipill</em> for you.</p>
<p>Note: These are not <em>actual </em>pills but things that may help you feel more rested and better. For example, it might suggest that you try a guided meditation or a moment of mindfulness, i.e. natural solutions to your problem.</p>
<p>Download&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yuza.digipill.droid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digipill</a> for free.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As technology moves forward, it&rsquo;s only natural that we&rsquo;re going to end up using it more and more. That&rsquo;s a given. Using the apps here, you can not only try and prevent your phone from interfering with your sleep, but also use it to help get a better quality of rest.</p>
<p>Despite this, it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that too much screen-time can be bad for your health. Be sure to take regular breaks to give your eyes and your mind a quick break. Now, go get your 40 winks. You deserve them!</p>
