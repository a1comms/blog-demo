<p><span class="postStandFirst">The latest, greatest iPhone to date has finally been announced... and here it is!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5881" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/topic_iphone_5.png" alt="iphone 5" width="480" height="480" /></p>
<p>Firstly, we can confirm that the latest smartphone offering from Apple is indeed called the&nbsp;iPhone 5!</p>
<p>As predicted the handset is thinner and lighter &ndash; weighing in at just 112 grams, a 20% improvement on the&nbsp;iPhone 4S, and measuring just 7.6mm thin which is 18% slimmer than the previous iteration.</p>
<p>The screen has received an increase too measuring in at 4 inches - it also boasts 1136 x 640 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, to make video viewing an even more pleasurable experience! This larger screen is also capable of hosting an extra row of app icons on the display.</p>
<p>The design is still the smooth and iconic glass form we all know and love, although now it has a stylish metal back to boot.</p>
<p>The battery life on the iPhone 5 will provide 8 hours of 3G talktime and a staggering 225 hours of standby time, which technically means that your iPhone 5 could last up to nine days!</p>
<p>The camera, while still an 8 megapixel sensor, is also improved. It features backside illumination, faster photo capture and a dynamic low light mode which means your camera will produce much better images in low light conditions. There is also a panoramic capture feature, which will produce fantastic wide-screen images. Plus, the front-facing camera will boast 1080p HD, meaning FaceTime will never be the same again!</p>
<p>Apple has done away with the 30-pin connector we all know and love, replacing it with an 8-pin reversible version. There will be an adaptor available so that existing Apple users can still utilise all their old devices together with their new iPhone 5.</p>
