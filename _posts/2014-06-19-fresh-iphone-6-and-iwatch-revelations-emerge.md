<p><span class="postStandFirst">Since our last iPhone 6 rumour roundup, fresh speculation has emerged from China, claiming that the iPhone 6 and iWatch are due to launch in tandem with each other, sometime this October.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4187 aligncenter" alt="iPhone 6 and iWatch rumours fuelled by iOS 8 Health app" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-19-at-15.50.13.png" width="460" height="442" /></p>

<h2>iPhone 6</h2>
<p>The same report seems assured that we will indeed be graced with two iPhones this year, much like the release of the Apple iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c.</p>
<p>One iteration, which will apparently sport a 4.7&rdquo; screen fashioned from Gorilla Glass, could be dubbed the iPhone 6 Air.</p>
<p>The other, which is said to house a massive 5.5&rdquo; display made from sapphire, is allegedly being labeled as the iPhone 6 Pro.</p>
<p>These names may just be an educated prediction, based on Apple&rsquo;s trends when it comes to its laptops. But either way, we quite like the idea.</p>
<h2>iWatch</h2>
<p>The iWatch, on the other hand, is perhaps even more elusive than the iPhone 6.</p>
<p>Very little information regarding Apple&rsquo;s mythical smartwatch has actually managed to slip through the net. So little, in fact, that it may well not even exist.</p>
<p>However, this industry wouldn&rsquo;t be the dynamic and exhilarating one that it is, if we all entertained such dull thoughts.</p>
<p>What we have picked up is that the iWatch could feature health and fitness tracking technology, which makes of lot of sense in light of Apple&rsquo;s announcement regarding a new Health app for iOS 8.</p>
<p>Rumours are pricing the fabled iWatch at around &pound;200. It&rsquo;s too early to comment, since we&rsquo;ve not seen any confirmed specs, features or designs, but you can&rsquo;t grumble at that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty likely we will finally have some official light shed on all of the above, sometime in September.</p>
<p><strong>As ever, we aim to fish out all the iPhone 6 and iWatch news we can. Watch this space for more updates.</strong></p>
