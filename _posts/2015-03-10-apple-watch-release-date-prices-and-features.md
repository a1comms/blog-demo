<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple Watch is set for launch on 24<sup>th</sup> April, with prices starting from &pound;299 and finishing much, much higher.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6304 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/apple-watch-release-date-970-80.jpg" alt="Apple Watch" width="624" height="351" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a> aficionados around the world will be syncing their primitive timepieces, in anticipation of the forthcoming launch of Apple Watch, set for pre-order from 10<sup>th</sup> April and general sale on 24<sup>th</sup> April.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s presuming they haven&rsquo;t yet sold their watches, to help offset the lucrative cost of some of Apple&rsquo;s higher-end editions of Apple Watch. The most expensive of which commanding a price tag of &pound;13,500. Youch.</p>
<p>Other editions, as revealed by Apple yesterday (during its keynote), are much more moderately priced. Apple Watch Sport, aimed at the health-conscious and fitness fanatics, starts at &pound;299, and rises to &pound;339 depending on the band size (38mm or 42mm).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6305 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/Apple-Watch-Sport-blue.png" alt="Apple Watch Sport" width="462" height="485" /></p>
<p>Apple Watch (with a stainless steel case) charges a little more for the pleasure of its company, starting from &pound;479. Again, depending on the band size and material, the price of this model can climb up considerably, to &pound;949.</p>

<p>Yet, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch (and their comparatively paltry price tags) are immediately eclipsed by Apple Watch Edition. Fashioned from 18-karat gold, in custom rose or yellow alloys, this resplendent piece of tech starts from &pound;8,000 and soars up to, as previously alluded to, &pound;13,500.</p>

<h2>So what is Apple Watch all about?</h2>
<p>Much like other smartwatches, like Samsung Gear S and Pebble Watch, Apple Watch is a wearable piece of tech that aims to simultaneously simplify and enhance your lifestyle, by bringing functions you&rsquo;d typically find on a smartphone, right to your wrist.</p>
<p>So, to elaborate, Apple Watch is able to perform oodles of everyday tasks, like allowing you to read emails, interact with Siri, receive calls and track fitness goals (including calories burnt, active minutes and inactive minutes) &ndash; all at a glance.</p>

<p>Apple Watch also acts as a miniature gateway to your favourite apps, albeit, in a simplified format. Users can retrieve updates from social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, and even browse The Guardian for all of the latest news.</p>
<p>Many of Apple&rsquo;s own native apps feature, too. Including iMessage, Calendar, Weather, Health, Mail, a&nbsp;Camera shutter button, Photos, Apple Maps and Passbook with Apple Pay.</p>
<p>By and large, Apple Watch is a shinier, more compact version of your <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, remoulded for your wrist. But to benefit from the complete Apple Watch experience, the two need to be paired over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>One obvious flaw is its battery life, which is designed to endure up to 18 hours of typical use. In other words, Apple Watch requires revitalising every night. Just like you.</p>
<p><strong>Initial launch will include several countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, United Kingdom (hurrah!) and United States.</strong></p>
