<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&lsquo;Crude&rsquo; and &lsquo;sick&rsquo;, or just a bit of fun? You decide&hellip;</span></p>
<p>If you tuned into Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent last weekend, you might have noticed something a little, um, <em>different</em> among the adverts.</p>
<p>In fact, it was one particular commercial (watch below) that got some TV audiences all riled up, going so far as to demand it be banned.</p>
<p>Do you know the particular advert we&rsquo;re referring to? Were you paying close enough attention?</p>
<p>The commercial, which played in the advert break of BGT, was for the music-streaming service, Spotify. It shows a girl walking down a corridor, holding a speaker playing the ever-so-popular tune &lsquo;Love Yourself&rsquo; by Justin Bieber. So far, so good, right?</p>
<p>The girl then stops in front of a bedroom door, plants the speaker on the floor in front of it, and says this daring line,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yep, Bieber's 'Love Yourself'. I think we all know what's going on in there.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>...</p>

<p>Awkward? You decide&hellip;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4A0TaubMFNU?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The advert is trying to promote Spotify&rsquo;s Premium for Family service, which allows up to six different users to have full access to the account for an overall fee of &pound;14.99 per month. The idea is that everyone in a household can have a personal account without it costing an absolute fortune.</p>
<p>Not quite going down as intended, the advert appeared to have upset watchers, as some took to Twitter to emphasise just how unimpressed they were. Words like &lsquo;crude&rsquo;, &lsquo;gross&rsquo; and &lsquo;disgraceful&rsquo; were bandied about, with some even asserting how ashamed Spotify should be.</p>
<p>Below are some less-than-impressed Tweets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>While some people were, apparently, outraged, it seems others were willing to see the funny side of things. Yep, not everyone took offense; in fact, one user even Tweeted that this particular commercial was the &lsquo;best Spotify advert in ages.&rsquo; High acclaim, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one Twitter user who wasn't sure if she was offended or not.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Someone explain that Spotify advert (with the Bieber music) to me. &#x1f628; I think I've got the wrong idea &#x1f628; actually I think I'm right but &#x1f628;</p>

<p>After the Twitter storm, Spotify released a statement apologising for the advert and any offence that it may have caused. Here&rsquo;s what it had to say:</p>
<p><em>"With this campaign we took our inspiration from some of the joys and frustrations of families, and how music can play a part in soundtracking some of family life's more offbeat and humorous moments. It was absolutely not our intention to cause any offence, but if we have done so, we are very sorry."</em></p>
