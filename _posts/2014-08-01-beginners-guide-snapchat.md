<p><span class="postStandFirst">Snapchat is rapidly becoming one of the most popular messaging apps in the mobile world, with 700 million Snaps sent every day, and rumours of the company behind the app being worth $10 billion. We take a look at Snapchat actually is, how it works, and what makes it unique, namely that any photo you send through it will automatically self-destruct once it&rsquo;s been viewed...</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4787" alt="snapchat" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/375518_201045846657_787275m.jpg" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>There are all sorts of apps out there, but some of the most popular are messaging apps. There&rsquo;s Skype, of course, perhaps the most well-known of the lot, but there are a wealth others, like Whatsapp, Yahoo Messenger, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger...</p>
<p>And then, there&rsquo;s Snapchat, an app that&rsquo;s rapidly becoming one of the most popular on the market. With somewhere in the region of 700 <i>million</i> messages being sent between Snapchat users every single day, and rumours that the company is worth around $10 billion, it&rsquo;s fair to say that Snapchat is enjoying something of a meteoric rise!</p>
<p>But what <i>is</i> Snapchat, and what makes it stand out from a sea of other messaging apps out there? What is it about the service that&rsquo;s attracted so many users, and should you join them?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p>
<h2>1) So, how does Snapchat work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4788" alt="snapchat" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/f99109d38ff0884216cee667e77dc50e_400x400.png" width="280" height="280" /></p>
<p>Like we said earlier, Snapchat is a messaging and photo-sharing app, but the key difference, the big thing that makes it unique (and that everybody else is trying furiously to copy), is the fact that the photos and videos you send through the app (called, collectively, &ldquo;Snaps&rdquo;) disappear after they&rsquo;ve been viewed by the person you sent them to. On top of that, you can specify a time limit for your contact to view the Snap (ranging from 1 to 10 seconds), and once that time limit has passed, the Snap is hidden from their device, and deleted from Snapchat&rsquo;s servers.</p>
<p>So, basically, for anyone old enough to remember <i>Mission: Impossible</i>, Snapchat works very much like the self-destructing message tapes the agents used in that, although naturally, they don&rsquo;t take your phone with them when they self-destruct.</p>
<p>That last part&rsquo;s probably quite a good thing; we can imagine it would get expensive to replace something like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the LG G3 every time someone sent you a photo...</p>
<p>So, why would people <i>want</i> to send self-destructing messages?</p>
<h2><b>2) Why do people use Snapchat?</b></h2>
<p>Ask anyone who knows how Snapchat works what they reckon people actually use the app for, and you can almost guarantee that their answer would be, &ldquo;To send something you wouldn&rsquo;t want to show your gran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, words to that effect, anyway...</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising, though, is that researchers have looked into how people use Snapchat, and the truth is that the majority of people <i>don&rsquo;t</i> use Snapchat for anything furtive and/or a bit mucky. Instead, most answered that it&rsquo;s because Snapchat is <i>fun</i> (well, that and sending funny content, like the stupid face they may have pulled, or possibly, trolling their friends).</p>
<p>Oh, and it&rsquo;s free, which is never to be sniffed at.</p>
<h2><b>3) Go on, then, how do I get Snapchat?</b></h2>
<p>Ah, well, this one&rsquo;s easy: you just head on over to Google Play (if you&rsquo;ve got an Android phone like the HTC One M8) or the Apple App Store, find Snapchat on there, and hit &lsquo;Install&rsquo;. Alas, though, it&rsquo;s only available for iOS and Android, although we live in hope that it will come to Windows Phone, too.</p>
<p><strong>And that, in a nutshell, is Snapchat. While it might not be to everyone&rsquo;s tastes, it&rsquo;s amassing more and more of a following every day, so give it a try, and see what you think.</strong></p>
