<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Say hello to facepalm, bacon, and&hellip;. creepy clowns! Watch the video below to see all emojis.</span></p>
<p>Long gone are the days when words were the most effective form of expression. Our generation has, by all appearances, outgrown them. Instead of typing out reams of endless text, we can simply select a few choice emojis and hit send. A picture really does tell a thousand words, right?</p>
<p>Well, when the much-awaited iOS 10.2 update hits our iPhones, there&rsquo;s a little surprise in store for Apple fans. Yes, this latest update is coming jam-packed with not one, not two but a whopping 72 new emojis!</p>
<p>But what new delights can we expect, once iOS 10.2 rolls out? Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Facepalm Like Patrick Stewart</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12220" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/11/Facepalm.jpg" alt="facepalm" width="600" height="314" /></p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re chatting away IRL, there are lots of weird and wonderful hand gestures we do, that, you would&rsquo;ve thought, couldn&rsquo;t be expressed in the form of an emoji. Well, Apple heard your cries, designing everything from the facepalm to a shrug, and even a selfie emoji. God forbid.</p>
<h2>May Harambe Rest in Peace</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thanks @Apple for finally giving Harambe the respect he deserves with the new emojis. <a href="https://t.co/VhrI3Oi4ng">pic.twitter.com/VhrI3Oi4ng</a></p>

<p>Besides giving us new ways to express typical gestures, Apple is also including an array of pop culture specific emojis, with the release of iOS 10.2. A few to look out for include Harambe, creepy clowns, and David Bowie&hellip; or, rather Ziggy Stardust, in this case. Now, when you&rsquo;re chit-chatting about a specific news event or the like, you&rsquo;ll have the ideal emoji to illustrate your point. Neat, huh?</p>
<h2>Equal Rights for Emojis</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12218" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/11/gender-equal-emojis-1.jpg" alt="gender-equal-emojis" width="600" height="460" /></p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re honest, the world of emojis has never reflected true gender equality. Male emojis take up certain jobs, such as workmen and detectives, which, apparently, are too far out of reach for the female emojis out there.</p>
<p>Finally, Apple has decided to get with the times and will be rolling out female empowering emojis, with women wearing hardhats and detective gear. The message? Ladies can (and do) take on the same roles as men. Right on.</p>
<h2>Food, Glorious Food!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12221" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/11/Food-Emojis.jpg" alt="food-emojis" width="1200" height="514" /></p>
<p>And now for everyone&rsquo;s favourite subject: food.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is an area Apple has not neglected in iOS 10.2, the new update. We&rsquo;ve been crying out for an avocado emoji for years, and it looks like the guac-loving community is about to get what it wants. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;ll also be everything from a salad emoji, to a pineapple, carrot and even a cucumber. Mmm&hellip; healthy.</p>
<h2>And So Much More&hellip;</h2>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a whole load more emojis on top of the ones mentioned so far. Other standouts you may want to look out for include the fox, duck, pregnant woman (a great way to tell people you&rsquo;re expecting!), and drum. They really have thought of every emoji we could possibly need.</p>
<h2>How to Download the New Emojis</h2>
<p>While the beta iOS 10.2 update is already available, the official update doesn&rsquo;t have a release date just yet. So if you can&rsquo;t wait, sign up to Apple&rsquo;s Developer program (it&rsquo;s free) and download all 72 new emojis right away.</p>
<p>In future, the quickest way to check if the official update is ready to download, is by going to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
