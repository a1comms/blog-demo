<p><span class="postStandFirst">We take an in-depth look at what Samsung magic the Galaxy S4 has hidden inside it to make it stand out from the rest.</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it Samsung has created a technological wonder in the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4, but what is it that gives this device the upper hand over its rivals?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/samsung_galaxy_s4.jpg" width="176" height="351" /></p>
<p>The answer is: software.</p>
<p>Samsung has thought long and hard about the evolvution of its Galaxy smartphones and has incorporated some amazing software tricks into the latest flagship handset.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S4 is the first handset outside of the Nexus 4 to ship with Jelly Bean 4.2, the latest build of the Android operating system.</p>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s custom Android skin is known as TouchWiz and each generation of Galaxy handset has seen more and more improvements. The latest version of TouchWiz has jumped forward spectacularly with Samsung wanting the user to interact with the Galaxy S4 like never before.</p>
<p>The first advancement is Air Gestures - this being the ability to control your phone without even touching the display. Secondly, Smart features have been given a boost with the inclusion of Smart Scroll which allows the user to read through text just by moving their eyes as eye movements are picked up by the front-facing camera.</p>
<p>Samsung has also embraced the importance of having your smartphone as a lifestyle tool and, therefore, included new software features such as S Health, an app with the ability to monitor health and fitness. The Galaxy S4 also features Group Play which allows you, and up to seven other Galaxy S4 users, to share music and play it through all the handsets as one giant stereo system, or even play games against each other.</p>
<p><strong>These are just a few of the incredible features that are included on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and help to make this it one of the most exciting devices to come out in 2013.</strong></p>
