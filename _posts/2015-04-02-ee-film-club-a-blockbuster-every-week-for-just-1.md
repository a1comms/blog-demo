<p><span class="postStandFirst">EE has officially launched EE Film Club, an exciting new service that allows all new and existing customers to stream a film of their choice, for just &pound;1.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6477 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/1426259388232.jpg" alt="EE Film Club" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>EE is working in partnership with <a href="https://uk.wuaki.tv/" target="_blank">Wuaki.tv</a>, one of Europe&rsquo;s leading video-on-demand streaming services, to bring you an eclectic library of cinema classics &ndash; right to your living room.</p>
<p>Anyone with EE, Orange or T-Mobile simply needs to text &lsquo;Film&rsquo; to 141, in order to receive a promo code that can redeemed at&nbsp;https://uk.wuaki.tv/eefilmclub, between Monday and Wednesday, every week.</p>
<p><a href="https://uk.wuaki.tv/lists/ee-film-club/movies" target="_blank">EE Film Club</a> is accessible across multiple devices; you can download the Wuaki app for your smartphone, tablet or EE TV, or visit Wuaki.tv if you&rsquo;re using a computer.</p>
<p>This new service follows the exit of Orange Wednesday, and falls in line with a change in consumer behaviour, with 1 in 3 UK adults now downloading or streaming films and TV, each week.</p>
<p>Pippa Dunn, Chief Marketing Officer at EE, said:&nbsp;&ldquo;More people than ever before are downloading and streaming movies so they can watch at home or on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With 1 in 3 UK adults enjoying digital entertainment every week - and this number is only going to grow - our viewing habits are clearly evolving.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>With one blockbuster from the EE Film Club costing just &pound;1, and the text to EE itself 35p, your next first-date might just be your cheapest.</strong></p>
