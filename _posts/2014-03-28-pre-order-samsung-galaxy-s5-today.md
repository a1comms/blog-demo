<p><span class="postStandFirst">After the unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S5, the buzz was that this new superphone had rocked people&rsquo;s worlds. If you&rsquo;re one of those people, we&rsquo;re very happy to inform you that the Samsung Galaxy S5 is now available for you to pre-order!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4752" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" width="960" height="978" /></p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t whether or not you&rsquo;re one of those people, here&rsquo;s a quick run-down of why the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5&nbsp;is such an amazing phone.</p>
<p>It starts with the looks; the Galaxy S5 is, quite simply, a gorgeous phone, with a sleek body that measures just 8.1mm thick, a dimpled backplate that looks great&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;makes the phone feel good in the hand, and a 5.1-inch 1080p screen which has to be seen to be believed. Mind-bogglingly, in spite of how slim and sleek it is, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;water-resistant, much like the upcoming&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2, making it as tough as it is beautiful.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not all about looks, as the Galaxy S5 is one one truly powerful superphone, with a Snapdragon 801 processor (clocked to 2.5GHz), 2GB of RAM, and in a move unprecedented amongst Samsung phones, a fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>This scanner is also PayPal-certified, and yes, that means you&rsquo;ll be able to pay for things just by touching your finger to your phone!</p>
<p><strong>When it was announced, the Samsung Galaxy S5 rocked many people&rsquo;s worlds, and if you&rsquo;re ready to let this new superphone rock&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;world, get your pre-order in now! You really don&rsquo;t want to miss out on&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;one!</strong></p>
