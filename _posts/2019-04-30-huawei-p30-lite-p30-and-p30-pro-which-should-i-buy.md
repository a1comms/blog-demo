<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Three awesome smartphones go head-to-head!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Are you ready to upgrade? If you&rsquo;re thinking of giving Huawei a whirl, you&rsquo;re in luck. The company recently announced not one&hellip; but three brand new smartphones.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to make a choice, we&rsquo;ve got just the thing. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of what the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-lite-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P30 Lite</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P30</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-pro-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P30 Pro</a> have to offer.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfxwablloIw" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Impeccable Design</h2>
<p>Set the Huawei P30, P30 Pro and P30 Lite devices next to each other and you&rsquo;ll notice one thing. The three phones are strikingly similar in look. So, let&rsquo;s first take a moment to talk about their similarities.</p>
<p>All of the devices have a massive screen, a dewdrop notch, and a vertical camera setup on the back. At a glance, there&rsquo;s not a lot in it.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to screen bezels, the Huawei P30 Pro is leading the pack. The premium device has slimmer bezels running down the side of the screen than the other two models. Instead, it comes with slick, curved edges and a screen that appears to wrap around the side of the device.</p>
<p>Similarly, the other two Huawei phones have more of a visible edge around the side of their screens, and yet maintain an equally minimal style.</p>
<p>When it comes to colour, Huawei has gone big on choice. The P30 model comes in Black, Aurora, and Crystal while the P30 Pro has the same options with the addition of the Amber Sunrise tone.</p>
<p>If you choose the P30 Lite, on the other hand, the colour options are entirely different &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got Blue, Black and White here.</p>

<h2>Beautiful Display<strong>s</strong></h2>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s talk display. As you might imagine, there&rsquo;s something of a size difference here.</p>
<p>The Huawei P30 model comes in with a stunning 6.1-inch OLED display while the P30 Lite has a slightly bigger 6.15-inch OLED offering. The P30 Pro takes things to a whole new level with a 6.47-inch OLED display. All of the devices have a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot between these sizes, which means that users won&rsquo;t notice a huge difference. Each of the new Huawei phones should fit right in the palm of your hand while giving you the freedom to reach both sides of the screen.</p>
<p>Getting the slightly large screen on the P30 Pro may well sway some people though.</p>
<h2>Masters of Photography</h2>
<p>Huawei has seriously invested when it comes to smartphone cameras. Each of the P30 models has a triple or Quad lens setup on the rear.</p>
<p>First up, let&rsquo;s talk about the Huawei P30 Lite. The setup includes a 24-, 8-, and 2-megapixel offering, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. The device is also packed with cool photography features, such as the 120 degree Ultra-Wide Angle lens and AI scene recognition technology, which should help you to seriously up your game.</p>
<p>When we take a look at the P30 Pro, we&rsquo;ve got an impressive Leica Triple Camera System. The offering includes 40-megapixel Super Sensing Camera, a 16-megapixel Ultra-Wide Angle Lens, and, finally, an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. Nice. There&rsquo;s also the 5x hybrid zoom plus a 30x digital zoom, which are not to be sniffed at.</p>

<p>So, how can the P30 Pro take things up a notch? Well, the Quad lens action is more impressive still on this device. You&rsquo;ve got a 40-megapixel Super Sensing Camera, a 20-megapixel Ultra-Wide Angle Lens, 8-megapixel and a Huawei TOF Camera all in one package. The zoom quality is a little more intense too with 10x hybrid zoom and 50x digital zoom.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCLG_UFlVrQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the cameras get progressively better throughout this range. One of the major differences between the phones is the quality of their setup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the P30 Lite option is a fantastic one, despite it being the lowest tech. That means that everything the other two have to offer is simply a bonus &ndash;&nbsp;the icing on top of the cake.</p>
<h2>Amazing Phone Features</h2>
<p>Each device in the brand new Huawei collection has a range of sparkling features. For one thing, they all offer the latest fingerprint technology. The only difference is that while the P30 and P30 Pro has an in-screen sensor, the Lite version has a sensor on the rear.</p>
<p>All of the phones also support Quick Charging, which means that you can juice up in no time. Both the P30 and P30 Lite devices have a headphone jack. On the other hand, the Pro model has a USB-C fitting, similar to what you may find on a modern-day iPhone.</p>
<p>Only the Huawei P30 Pro has the reverse charge feature. This one allows you to use your smartphone to charge up other Bluetooth devices simply by placing them on the back of the phone. Essentially, it means that the device works as a charging pad.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20523" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2019/03/huawei-p30-pro-wireless-reverse-charging.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="294" /></p>
<p>Of course, all of the devices come with a great, easy-to-use interface along with a whole load of features too. When it comes to choosing between the three latest Huawei phones, you may have to consider whether you want extras such as the reverse charge, in-screen finger sensor, and a more modern headphone fitting.</p>
<h2>Storage and Power</h2>
<p>When it comes to RAM, the phones go in order of their value. The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-lite-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P30 Lite</a> comes in at 4GB, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P30</a> has 6GB and then the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p30-pro-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P30 Pro</a> has a whopping 8GB. The P30 and P30 Lite both have 128GB ROM, while the P30 Pro has up to 256GB instead (Amber only).</p>
<p>So, when we&rsquo;re talking about power and speed, the chances are that the latter is the most impressive. Then again, it&rsquo;s worth noting that all of the devices can have their memory extended.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already covered, the devices all have Quick Charging, but what battery sizes do they have? Again, these go in the order of the phone&rsquo;s value. So, the Huawei P30 Lite has a 3340 mAh offering, the standard P30 has a 3650 mAh battery and the P30 Pro has a 4200 mAh battery.</p>
<p>Of course, due to the size differences and different functionality of the phones, there&rsquo;s no saying what effect these batteries will have on the power.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that these devices go up in power and storage incrementally &ndash;&nbsp;each one is a little better than the last. However, since the starting point is already great quality, the average user will likely be happy with any of the above.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20521" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2019/03/huawei-p30-pro-performance.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<h2>Price and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s see how much each device costs. The Huawei P30 Lite comes in at &pound;329 while the P30 model is &pound;699 and the Pro version is &pound;899. That&rsquo;s quite a difference in costs there, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that there is a huge leap in terms of tech between the three newest Huawei smartphones.</p>
<p>So, which should you choose? Well, that will depend on both your budget and what you need from your phone. The P30 Lite is an excellent value smartphone, offering some surprisingly great photography features.</p>
<p>Then, the P30 is a flagship device, offering extras such as the in-screen sensor and higher-end screen too. Of course, the most powerful and snazzy of the three is the P30 Pro, which has a larger price tag to match. It&rsquo;s got extras such as reverse charge and an epic camera. It&rsquo;s a hard one! Choices, choices.</p>
