<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Everything you love about iPhone just got that much better.</span></p>
<p>Love them, or hate them, Apple know how to put on a show.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s keynote featured a Carpool Karaoke skit with Tim Cook, James Corden and Pharrell Williams. We saw chart-topper Sia wrap events up with a memorable vocal performance. And, in between, Super Mario announced his comeback with a new game heading to iOS this year.</p>
<p>Despite competing with so many household names, the real stars of the show were undoubtedly <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7</a> and <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a> &ndash; the latest generation in Apple&rsquo;s line up of smartphones.</p>
<p>Their arrival ushers in a new era of water-resistant iOS devices, equipped with what could be the best smartphone cameras available, as well as a list of other exciting new features that we know you will love.</p>

<p>You can watch Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 7 keynote in full on page 2, or find out all of the key features right here in our iPhone 7 review.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Price and Release Date</h2>
<p>iPhone 7 is open to pre-orders. You can check out pricing on our site right now, and secure yourself a spot on the priority list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to start dishing out any solid release dates. Early indications suggest that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may not ship at the same time, as initially expected. The popularity of certain storage sizes and colours are likely to affect availability, though the smaller iPhone looks to be in good supply and ready for launch next week.</p>
<p>More on this to come.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11450 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iphone-7-pre-order.jpg" alt="iphone-7-pre-order" width="600" height="67" /></a></p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Design</h2>
<p>The cynics out there might roll their eyes at what looks like <em>just another iPhone</em>, but then again, cynics are cynics, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the appearance, <em>at a glance</em>, resembles iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, but there are reasons aplenty to get excited about iPhone 7&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the two new colour options. Ditching the comparatively lacklustre grey variant, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in a classy matt-effect black, and a high-gloss jet black, the latter of which we predict to be the choice finish for this generation of iPhones.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11451" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iPhone-7-design-colours.jpg" alt="iphone-7-design-colours" width="600" height="289" /></p>
<p>The new options join the signature line up that includes <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-silver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silver</a>, <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-rose-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rose gold</a>, all of which are fashioned from 7000 Series aluminium, designed to endure life&rsquo;s bumps and bruises.</p>
<p>iPhone 7 isn&rsquo;t just built to fend off physical wear, but liquid damage too. These are in fact the first iPhones to boast water (and dust) resistance, meaning you don&rsquo;t need to lose your head every time the situation gets a bit soggy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11452" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/design-water-resistant.jpg" alt="design-water-resistant" width="600" height="335" /></p>
<p>The Home button has seen a noteworthy revamp. It&rsquo;s now pressure-sensitive, and works much in the same way as the 3D Touch-enabled display. By varying the amount of pressure you apply to it, you can perform different commands and quicker actions.</p>
<p>Remember the uproar around the rumour that Apple was ditching the headphone jack? Yeah, well, they kind of went and did it anyway. Neither iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus feature a single headphone jack between them. Anywhere. We&rsquo;ve checked.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11453" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iPhone-7-bottom.jpg" alt="iphone-7-bottom" width="600" height="369" /></p>
<p>Apple has instead decided to consolidate the design, making better use of the Lightning port, which now supports headphones with a compatible connector. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. Those Beats headphones you just had to eBay your kidney for are starting to look like a gloomy mistake.</p>
<p>Worry not, Apple is including a pair of Lightning Connector earphones with every iPhone, as well as an adapter that will support your existing 3.5mm jack earphones.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11455" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Winning-1.gif" alt="winning" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>The final design change worth a mention is the relocation of the antenna strips. They&rsquo;re now sat at the very top and bottom of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which tidies things up, presenting a more complete appearance.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Display</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear by now that Apple isn&rsquo;t interested in playing the numbers game. iPhone 7, at 4.7-inches, sports a 750p HD display. And iPhone 7 Plus, the larger of the two at 5.5-inches, features 1080p Full HD display.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an Android flagship-user reading this, then you&rsquo;re probably thinking <em>whoop dee doo</em>. With the rest of the market pushing for pixels, reeling out smartphones with Quad HD displays, it feels like iPhones are puzzlingly outdated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case. When you&rsquo;re dealing with smartphone displays, which are comparatively minute compared to TVs, it becomes less about resolution, and more about colour, contrast and saturation. Apple is focusing on overall quality, not sharpness for the sake of it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11456" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iPhone-7-display.jpg" alt="iphone-7-display" width="1312" height="640" /></p>
<p>Apple dub these the &ldquo;brightest, most colourful iPhone displays&rdquo; yet, after introducing a new, wider colour gamut, which they say can &ldquo;deliver cinema-standard colours.&rdquo; In effect, that means the colour palette looks more accurate and more vibrant.</p>
<p>3D Touch makes an expected return, bringing with it deeper ways of interacting with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. iPhone 6s users will be all too familiar with how it works; when you press the display a little harder you launch different shortcuts or commands, much like the right click on a computer mouse.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Sound and Music</h2>
<p>With Apple making the <em>courageous </em>decision to discard the headphone jack, music has certainly played a central role in the iPhone 7 debate. Now, for the first time, it comes equipped with two speakers (top and bottom) for enhanced, stereo sound.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just about a boost in volume, although it is much louder; iPhone 7 offers a more dynamic range that can be enjoyed at different angles. In other words, you don&rsquo;t have to tilt the base of your iPhone to your ear anymore, if you&rsquo;re straining to listen to something in a loud environment. The increased output simply does a better job of reaching you.</p>
<p>Importantly, your video content will sound a lot more immersive, and is particularly enjoyable on iPhone 7 Plus, which sports the larger 5.5-inch display.</p>

<h2>iPhone 7 Camera</h2>
<p>Two of the world&rsquo;s best smartphone cameras just got even better. Starting with iPhone 7, Apple has added optical image stabilisation to the 12-megapixel shooter (a feature that was previously exclusive to the Plus variant), helping reduce blur caused by unsteady hands and erratic movements.</p>
<p>A larger f/1.8 aperture lens takes in more light than iPhone 6s, and the result is brighter shots in low-light situations. Handy when in-doors or caught in glum, overcast weather. In addition, the Quad-LED True Tone flash will light up any dark moments the large lens can&rsquo;t fix.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_11457" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-11457" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iPhone-7-photo.jpg" alt="Taken on iPhone 7" width="600" height="450" /> Taken on iPhone 7[/caption]</p>
<p>For the first time, the Plus variant feels like a true upgrade from the smaller one. Built with dual 12-megapixel wide-angle and telephoto cameras, iPhone 7 Plus is capable of getting closer to the action with a 2x optical zoom, and 10x digital zoom. Because of the sophistication of the technology, you don&rsquo;t compromise on the quality of your photos.</p>
<p>Further highlighting iPhone 7 Plus&rsquo; superiority for photography, is the snazzy depth-of-field effect that you get on professional DSLR cameras. iPhone 7 Plus&rsquo; dual cameras work together to bring an object into focus, while blurring out the background. It&rsquo;s called the bokeh effect, and makes you look way better at photography than you actually are.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_11458" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-11458" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/iPhone-7-Plus-photo.jpg" alt="Bokeh effect on iPhone 7 Plus" width="600" height="328" /> Bokeh effect on iPhone 7 Plus[/caption]</p>
<p>Both iPhones feature a new 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that will improve the sharpness of your video calls and Snapchat selfies. They also offer a wide range of filming modes, including 4K, slo-mo and time-lapse. And Live Photos are on board, of course, bringing your photo albums to life.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Battery and Power</h2>
<p>Thanks to the impressively efficient A10 Fusion chip, you&rsquo;ll get two more hours of battery life from iPhone 7, and one more from iPhone 7 Plus, than you would from the last generation.</p>
<p>You also get more power and speed, thanks to the upgraded four-core design that Apple say is 2x faster than iPhone 6. It&rsquo;s not as if iPhones have ever lacked in this department, but who are we to turn down more power and efficiency when it&rsquo;s offered.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Verdict</h2>
<p>This is isn&rsquo;t the radical change that some might have hoped for, cosmetically at least, but Apple certainly hasn&rsquo;t held back on innovation, particularly regards to iPhone 7 Plus.</p>
<p>There are a number of new features that impress, chiefly the dual-cameras, water-resistant design and more efficient chipset. And with <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/how-to-get-ios-10-today">iOS 10</a> bringing with it a host of advanced features, we think the iPhone experience is better than it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
