<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">And here&rsquo;s why it won&rsquo;t ever happen again.</span></p>
<p>Doubtless one of the biggest tech stories of 2016 was the rather unexpected Samsung Galaxy Note7 fiasco. It was around September when reports emerged, claiming units were overheating, setting on fire, and, in rare cases, even exploding.</p>
<p>Of course, the team at Samsung reacted to this news quickly and professionally. After launching a replacement program, it seemed the troubles were over, but that was not the case&hellip;</p>
<p>Some of the replacement Note 7 units had the same issues (overheating and occasionally combusting). It was then that the South Korean tech giant halted production of the Note 7 entirely. Since then, a whopping 97% of the 3 million devices sold have been returned.</p>
<p>While customers have been fully reimbursed, the officials still had the job of getting to the root of the problem. All may have been quiet over at camp Samsung in the last few months, but you should know that Samsung has been hard at work to make sure that a problem like this never occurs again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We assembled 700 engineers who completed months of testing on more than 200,000 devices and 30,000 batteries,&rdquo; Samsung officials explain in a statement. &ldquo;Then we reviewed every aspect of our process, from hardware, software, assembly, testing to logistics in detail. Finally, it was concluded that the <strong>batteries had been the cause</strong> of the issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, what is the Samsung team doing to make sure that it never happens again? Well, in the very same statement, Samsung has set out its master plan. First of all, it has highlighted an 8-point battery safety test, and, in addition, improved the battery quality too.</p>
<h2>The 8-Point Battery Safety Check</h2>
<p>Since the batteries were at fault in the Note 7 devices, it&rsquo;s now crucial that Samsung works to make sure that all further products are safe. So, what will the battery check actually consist of? Here are the different steps of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Durability test</li>
<li>X-Ray</li>
<li>Visual inspection</li>
<li>Charge and discharge test</li>
<li>Total Volatile Organic Compound test</li>
<li>Delta Open Circuit Voltage test</li>
<li>Dissembling test</li>
<li>Accelerated usage test</li>
</ul>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not all; the team also went on to explain that they will now be using a panel of experts to check their battery safety. &ldquo;We have invited a team of experts from academia and research centres so they can continue to provide us with their objective analysis to ensure the safety of the battery,&rdquo; reads the official statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that officials are keen to restore faith in the Samsung brand, and that they&rsquo;re doing all they can to prevent further issues. &ldquo;From reassessing every step of our smartphone manufacturing process to redesigning our quality assurance program, we are committed to implementing every learning to ensure the quality and safety going forward.&rdquo; Phew! Well, that&rsquo;s good news.</p>
