<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new iPhone 6 image has appeared online, which seems to reveal a box insert for the upcoming iPhone. While there are some real doubts that this is the genuine article, if it <i>is</i>, it shows that some running changes have been implemented, like the placement the iPhone 6 buttons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-4966 aligncenter" alt="iPhone 6 image" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/iPhone-6-666x1024.jpg" width="666" height="1024" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Want to win an iPhone 6? Enter our competition where you could win one, in addition to Apple TV and a Sony 50&rdquo; TV.</em></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting closer and closer to the supposed date that the iPhone 6 is rumoured to be unveiled, and as time goes on, we&rsquo;re seeing more and more leaks which purport to reveal new nuggets of information about said upcoming iPhone (or <i>iPhones</i>, if the rumour about multiple variants is true).</p>
<p>And now, we have a <i>new</i> leak, an image that <i>purports</i> to show part of the box contents for the iPhone 6, according to MacRumors.</p>
<p>We say that it <i>purports</i> to show part of the box contents, because there&rsquo;s some debate over whether this image is the genuine article. The biggest cause for doubt is the fact that the fonts on the unconfirmed image don&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> match up to the official fonts Apple uses, both on actual phones like the iPhone 5s, and on printed material in the box.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are slashes missing in the text on the purported box insert, where the relevant parts should be written as &ldquo;Ring/Silent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home Button/Touch ID&rdquo;, and it <i>does</i> seem unlikely that Apple would let an error like that slip through the next, even if this was a mock-up of the final box insert.</p>
<p>However, if it is genuine, it <i>does</i> show some interesting things about the next iPhone, namely that some of the buttons and connectors (the volume buttons and the Lightning connector port) have been relocated and redesigned.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6 is allegedly set to be unveiled on September 9th, and it&rsquo;s going to be very interesting to see how it stacks up against rival superphones like the LG G3, or the new phone that&rsquo;s designed <i>specifically</i> to take on the iPhone, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re excited for the launch of the iPhone 6, make sure you enter our fantastic competition where you can win one, as well as Apple TV <i>and </i>a 50&rdquo; Sony TV.&nbsp;</strong></p>
