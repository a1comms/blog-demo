<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">iPhone could have been <em>so </em>different&hellip;</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that the world of tech has come a long way in the last 30 years. Back in 1987, some of the gadgets we know and love today would have been considered more science fiction than realistic possibilities.</p>
<p>This year is a particularly special one. It marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone (released <em>way</em> back in 2007!). If you look at that first device, it doesn&rsquo;t feel totally alien to the iPhones of today. Sure, it&rsquo;s a little on the clunky side, and perhaps less refined, but the core distinctive characteristics haven&rsquo;t changed all that much.</p>

<p>The touchscreen, home button, and slick design are all still very much present.</p>
<p>But what about, instead of looking forward, we looked back? Have you ever imagined what iPhone would&rsquo;ve looked like, had it been released back in 1987?</p>
<p>Well, no, neither had I, but now you don&rsquo;t have to. You see, artist Pierre Cerveau has done all the thinking (and designing) for you. In a series of pictures, he reimagined what the phone <em>may </em>have looked like if it had come 20 years earlier. And yes, it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p>So, what would have changed? Well, one of the important things you should remember when looking at this imagined design is that 1987 was a different, simpler time in terms of technology.</p>
<p>Gadgets were yet to become streamlined and svelte. It simply wasn&rsquo;t possible to fit a powerful machine into a small, sleek little package. With that in mind, the 1987-edition iPhone that Cerveau has created is far chunkier than modern-day phones. It would also have come in a less-than-attractive off-white colour. Yuck&hellip;</p>

<p>Complete with a pixelated screen and 512 KB of storage, this retrospective iPhone looks like something inspired from the original Macintosh range. Since touchscreens weren&rsquo;t widely available 30 years ago, the phone has a standard screen, a nine-pin DVI port and a physical scrolling wheel. In theory, the wheel would work in a similar manner as the ones on original iPods.</p>

<p>This is actually not the first gadget that Cerveau has reimagined in the name of art. In the past, he&rsquo;s also gone to town on the Walkman and the gramophone. While this 1987 version of the original iPhone (sorry, Macintosh Phone!) is doubtless imaginative, I know that I&rsquo;m glad Apple waited until 2007.</p>
