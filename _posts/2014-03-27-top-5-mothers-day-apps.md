<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s that time of year again, the time when we all honour the lady who brought us up, before shoving us out the door in an attempt to make us at least try to be adults; yes, folks, Mother&rsquo;s Day is this weekend!</span></p>
<p>Unlike the dim and distant past, mums of today are savvy people, who aren&rsquo;t afraid to use the latest in consumer electronics, even if some of them were more or less forced into using them by their kids (<em>side note, apropos of nothing: hello mum!</em>). Put simply, mums use smartphones and tablets, and they like apps, so what are the best apps for your mum this Mother&rsquo;s Day?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look, in no particular order, at 5 of the best...</p>
<h2>Flowerly</h2>
<p>This first one is a tiny bit of a cheat, as you don&rsquo;t actually install the Flowerly app on your mum&rsquo;s device; instead, you install it on your&nbsp;<em>own</em>&nbsp;device (and since it&rsquo;s iOS-only, you&rsquo;ll need something like the&nbsp;iPhone 5s, or the bright and cheerful&nbsp;iPhone 5c), and then you can send virtual flowers to either your mum&rsquo;s Facebook or her email.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the simplest gestures are the nicest ones, so sending her flowers, even virtual ones, will be sure to make her day (and keep you in her good graces, in case you need your washing doing; we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;been there)...</p>

<h2>Zinio</h2>
<p>Digital magazines are big business, largely because, with the huge boom in smartphones and news online, print magazines are on the wane. The Zinio app is perhaps the best way to buy and read magazines through a mobile device. Available on all three platforms, Zinio will let your mum keep up to date with her magazines all in one place, whether she reads&nbsp;<em>Hello!</em>,&nbsp;<em>Elle</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Autocar</em>&nbsp;(yes, mums can like cars, too).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/13463612564_a59d8f318f_q.jpg" width="146" height="146" /></p>
<h2>Evernote</h2>
<p>Mums can remember&nbsp;<em>everything</em>, we all know this. They remember birthdays without having to check, and anniversaries, and you can guarantee they&rsquo;ll remember every embarrassing thing you&rsquo;ve ever done (we suspect this superpower comes from trying to keep us in line when we were kids).</p>
<p>However, remembering&nbsp;<em>literally everything</em>&nbsp;is bound to take its toll on your mum, so why not treat her to the Evernote app, and let her smartphone or tablet share the memory load?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/13463255965_105c3bbd08_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h2>Sudoku</h2>
<p>Some people (i.e. me) might not see the appeal of Sudoku, but it&rsquo;s surprising how many mums swear by it (as opposed to swearing&nbsp;<em>at</em>&nbsp;it, for being too hard, which is what I&rsquo;d do). Perhaps it&rsquo;s because mums are genetically good at&nbsp;<em>everything</em>, but number puzzles just give in in terror at their matriarchal glare.</p>
<p>There are loads of Sudoku apps available on all three platforms, so whether she&rsquo;s got an iOS device, an Android device like the Moto G, or a Windows phone like the Nokia Lumia 520, there&rsquo;s plenty to choose from!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/13463355523_57cbb17ef4_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h2>Epicurious</h2>
<p>No matter how good a cook you are, your mum is better. That&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<em>law</em>. With the Epicurious app, she can get access to hundreds of new recipes, and go on to work even more miracles in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Plus, of course, if she&rsquo;s using a water-resistant phone like the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5, she can just pop the phone down with the recipe onscreen, safe in the knowledge it won&rsquo;t get damaged (as long as she doesn&rsquo;t pop it down over the chip pan, say; it&rsquo;s water-resistant, not deep-fry-resistant).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7050/13463255085_a06e75f815_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p><strong>Mums are awesome, so if your mum is the tech-savvy type (and in the modern world, it&rsquo;s likely she is), grab her one of these apps, and make her Mother&rsquo;s Day a bit more special!</strong></p>
