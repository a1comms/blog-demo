<p><span class="postStandFirst">Angry Birds is most definitely not just a game series. It may have began life that way, but it&rsquo;s become a legitimate social phenomenon, crossing over from games, into media and toys. The rise of Angry Birds has been, in short, truly meteoric.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3714/13123463484_277b6a95d7_z.jpg" width="591" height="331" /></p>
<p>But why is that? What is it about the&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;franchise, that began life as a game originally played on predecessors to the&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note 3, that has made it so successful?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>1) Rock Solid Gameplay</h2>
<p>Much has been made of the fact that&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;is hauntingly similar to a free Flash game made before it, called&nbsp;<em>Crush The Castle</em>, and we&rsquo;d be completely disingenuous if we said that we couldn&rsquo;t see the similarities. However, there are some really rather crucial differences, which actually serve to make the core gameplay even&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;solid.</p>
<p>Simply put,&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;plays like a dream, whether you&rsquo;re playing it on a tablet, through the Chrome browser, or on a smartphone like the iPhone 5c.</p>
<p>However, the appeal of&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;goes beyond the gameplay...</p>
<h2>2) Loveable Characters</h2>
<p><em>Crush The Castle</em>&nbsp;was a fun game, no doubt about it, but one thing that it always felt like it lacked was personality. The same cannot be said of&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>, as the larger than life avians have even gone to become well-known characters outside of the mobile world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Red, the red bird (no surprises, there). There&rsquo;s Chuck, the yellow bird. There&rsquo;s Terence the big bird, Stella the pink bird, Matilda the egg-laying bird... the list goes on, but anyone who plays the games will be familiar with those characters.</p>
<h2>3) Stunning 2D Graphics</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency, among some gamers, to say that a game is only as good as its graphics, and that anything not rendered in super-photorealistic, 4K resolution graphics is, well, rubbish. They forget that&nbsp;<em>art style</em>&nbsp;is more important than graphical intensity, and&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;has style in spades. It&rsquo;s a cartoony style, sure, but it looks brilliant, and the 2D graphics mean that the game will happily play on a wider range of phones, including budget devices, which helped it to sell more copies.</p>

<h2>4) Ad-Free Option</h2>
<p><em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;is an example of the ad-supported app model done right; there are two versions of the games, one version being paid while the other is free/ad-supported, but the crucial point is that the content is identical between the two versions.</p>
<p>In short, making it available for free convinced a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;more people to give it a try, who might not have done otherwise.</p>
<h2>5) Never-ending Fun</h2>
<p>The final point is an easy: all of the four previous points combine together into one big gestalt entity, and that gestalt entity&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;<em>FUN</em>&rdquo;. While some may complain about&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;being a casual game, and while some might not like developer&nbsp; Rovio&rsquo;s marketing blitzes, the simple fact remains that&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>&nbsp;is an unbelievably fun experience, and that, when you get right down to it, is why it&rsquo;s gone from game to social phenomenon. It is, quite simply, because it&rsquo;s awesomely good fun.</p>
<p><strong>Except for the Red&rsquo;s Mighty Feathers level pack, of course. That one was just&nbsp;<em>evil</em>...</strong></p>
