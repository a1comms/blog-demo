<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We hope the police catch &lsquo;em all!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Pok&eacute;mon GO addict, or <em>were</em>, you&rsquo;ll know that the app can be pretty immersive to say the least. Once you start an epic hunt, almost nothing will come between you and your many conquests.</p>
<p>Nothing except, perhaps, other Pok&eacute;mon GO players. Still, while most of us wouldn&rsquo;t dream of getting violent while catching &lsquo;em all, some just can&rsquo;t control themselves.</p>
<p>According to the Evening Standard, it&rsquo;s been revealed by Police that in one case last year, that started out as an innocent enough Pok&eacute;mon GO hunt, a whopping 30 gamers ended up in a brawl, apparently caused by the game. Police were called to break up the fight, which erupted in Surrey.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14621" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BUZjvZm6TCBbfW-bHqlwHuwCVUVJlA-JVY1_KSmxmO5hR29RK5C5Q7LAnN8vDZyGgBNiI-SlbfoYazNeSddZsv7N=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t reveal specific information about <em>why </em>and <em>how </em>the bust-up started, so the mind can only boggle. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how Pok&eacute;mon GO could get people so riled up that they&rsquo;d resort to blows. Surprisingly, this isn&rsquo;t an isolated Pok&eacute;mon-related crime...</p>
<p>The Evening Standard reports that the Liberal Democrats found out about the Pok&eacute;mon GO fight, after a Freedom of Information request. The details of the request were published, revealing a long list of Pok&eacute;mon GO related crimes (no, really!), including exposure in West Yorkshire, domestic violence crimes in the West Midlands and muggings around the UK.</p>
<p>Former Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said: &ldquo;Hearing serious crimes are committed using Pok&eacute;mon is worrying, especially as a dad with kids who love the game. It clearly shows nothing is 100 percent safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last summer, the BBC reported that there had been 290 crimes related to those playing Pok&eacute;mon GO, including theft and driving offences. So, the latest news should really come as no major shock. Needless to say, stay safe when Pok&eacute;mon hunting!</p>

<p><em>Pok&eacute;mon GO became an overnight hit when it was released in July 2016. In its first week, it was downloaded an incredible 10 million times, making it Apple&rsquo;s most downloaded app ever. Since then, it has remained a somewhat less popular game, despite regular updates and new features. </em></p>
