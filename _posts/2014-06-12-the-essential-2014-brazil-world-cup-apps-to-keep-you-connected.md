<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s pretty fair to say that the patience of every single football fan - from every corner of the globe - has been severely tested for four long, tortuous years. But alas, that wait is now over; breathe a sigh of relief and embrace the reprieve. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil kicks off today, and we bring you our favourite World Cup apps to keep you in-the-know at every stage!<br />
</span></p>
<p>We understand that, despite how much you might wish otherwise, your busy lifestyles don&rsquo;t stop when the World Cup starts. So we&rsquo;ve complied a list of the five most essential World Cup apps to keep you on top of the most anticipated competition the world has ever seen.</p>
<h2>1) Official FIFA World Cup app</h2>
<p>Since this is FIFA&rsquo;s official World Cup app, you&rsquo;ll get access to whole host of exclusives and live updates. Catch every goal, with in-play match commentary for each game, and keep abreast with all the latest World Cup news, as well as the latest results, fixture lists and group standings. This app will also give you access to some great videos and photos, on top of the latest FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can receive live score updates from 102 of the world&rsquo;s best football leagues, so this app is certainly worth keeping even after the World Cup finishes.</p>
<p>The Official FIFA app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play</p>

<h2>2) BBC Sport</h2>
<p>You won&rsquo;t miss a single World Cup highlight thanks to push alerts to your smartphone from the BBC Sport app. The BBC will be covering all 64 matches, in one way or another, so you can keep up to date with as much summer football as you like. Of those matches, 31 will be televised by the BBC and will be available to watch through this app. You can bet that the bright colours of Brazil&rsquo;s kit will look epic on the Sony Xperia Z2&rsquo;s stunning HD 5.2&rdquo; display.</p>
<p>Using this app will also give you access to World Cup news as and when it occurs in Brazil, including team selections, injuries and all of the remaining drama.</p>
<p>The BBC Sport app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play</p>

<h2>&nbsp;3) ITV Player</h2>
<p>Watch live coverage of the World Cup, or simply catch up on the highlights &ndash; all with the ITV Player app. ITV will be broadcasting 34 of the games in Brazil, live on TV and through its app, starting with the World Cup&rsquo;s opening fixture between the hosts, Brazil, and Croatia. Can you imagine how hair-raisingly electrifying the atmosphere is going to sound, on a device like the HTC One M8 with its dual stereo speakers and HTC BoomSound technology? I&rsquo;m getting goosebumps just thinking about it!</p>
<p>Just like the BBC, ITV will also be producing live content throughout the entire competition, even if its not live on TV or online, ready for you to digest and enjoy through its app.</p>
<p>The ITV Player app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play</p>

<h2>4) FIFA 14</h2>
<p>FIFA 14 needs no introduction to most, I&rsquo;m sure; but after the latest update, the mobile app now boasts the officially licensed 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil national teams. So even if the real World Cup chews England up and spits us out (again &ndash; but we sincerely hope not!), you can rewrite history and create your own fairytale ending on the FIFA 14 app.</p>
<p>This app is by far the most authentic, life-like football game available on a smartphone, so make sure you get the most out of it with a device like the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, which packs a blazing fast 2.5GHz quad-core processor and a beautiful 5.1&rdquo; HD display.</p>
<p>Of course the fun doesn&rsquo;t end when the World Cup does, as the FIFA 14 app features various game modes at club level, so you can test your gaming abilities against the top teams in Europe too!</p>
<p>The FIFA 14 app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play</p>

<h2>5) Panini Online Sticker Album</h2>
<p>The FIFA World Panini Sticker Album has finally been launched in to the digital sphere! It&rsquo;s every football fan&rsquo;s favourite excuse to regress back into their childhood once again, and attempt the difficult, but ultimately rewarding, task of filling a sticker book full of the 32 teams that have succeeded in reaching the World Cup Finals.</p>
<p>The mobile app is the real deal! Open up to five sticker packs a day, and earn a bonus pack whenever you complete a full team. You can swap duplicate stickers with other football fans from around the world&hellip; got, got, need! You can join and create groups of collectors, get entered into the Hall of Fame and even win prizes. Who thought a sticker book could be so fun, right?</p>
<p>The Panini Online Sticker Album is free to download from the App Store and Google Play</p>
