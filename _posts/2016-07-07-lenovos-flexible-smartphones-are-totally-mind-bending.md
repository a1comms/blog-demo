<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The Lenovo CPlus and Folio are bending it like Beckham. That's still a cool reference, right?</span></p>
<p>2017 is set to be the year that smartphones turn the corner towards a foldable future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always hearing talk of the &lsquo;Next Big Thing&rsquo; in the mobile industry&hellip; there are shouts of everything ranging from holographic screens to bendable phones, and although some of these are fiction not&nbsp;fact, it turns out <em>bendable smartphones</em> are set to be a reality!</p>
<p>Samsung has been an early adopter of this new, slightly surreal technology, and has shown various concept models at shows such as CES. It&rsquo;s believed that the first official, market-ready device from the South Korean company will be called Samsung Galaxy X.</p>

<p>Of course, this kind of hardware has only manifested itself so far as a pipedream, with years of quiet development behind closed doors. But it looks like Lenovo is turning that dream into a reality.</p>
<p>At the recent Lenovo Tech World show, two remarkable devices were revealed. The first, a smartphone called Lenovo CPlus that can wrap around your wrist, and the other, a tablet called Lenovo Folio that folds in half to become a double-sided mobile phone.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_10820" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-10820" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/wristband.jpg" alt="wristband" width="600" height="450" /> Lenovo CPlus - a foldable Android mobile that turns into a smartwatch[/caption]</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_10813" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-10813" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/tablet-phone.jpg" alt="tablet-phone" width="600" height="401" /> Lenovo Folio - a foldable Android tablet set to hit the market in 2017[/caption]</p>
<p>As you can see, the devices are very different in design, but feature the same technology that&rsquo;s as physically bending as it is mind bending.</p>
<p>The Lenovo CPlus is a 4.7-inch mobile phone that can wrap round the user&rsquo;s arm, transforming into a powerful smartwatch. It runs on Android, so will feature all the usual goodies we&rsquo;re used to on our smartphones, thus making it a more capable device than current smartwatches.</p>
<p>The second device, Lenovo Folio, is an 8-inch Android tablet that literally folds in half, essentially making a mobile with two displays&hellip; Again, this device is powered by Android, and will probably look similar to the fabled Samsung Galaxy X we mentioned above.</p>
<p>Lenovo did make it clear that these two bendable contraptions are still in development, but you get the idea of how they look and work. Apparently both will be ready to hit the market in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>So, next year&rsquo;s shaping up to be an exciting one for the mobile phone industry, not just because of bendable tech finally beginning to dip its toe in the market, but also with the emergence of modular smartphones. Roll on 2017!</strong></p>
