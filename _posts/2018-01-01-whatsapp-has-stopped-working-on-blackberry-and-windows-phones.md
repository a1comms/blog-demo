<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We think it&rsquo;s time to upgrade&hellip;</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the one billion plus people who use WhatsApp, we have some important news for you. Brace yourself. Take a seat. As of the new year (a.k.a. 2018), the messaging app will be waving goodbye to some older smartphone operating systems.</p>
<p>So, if you happen to own a device running Windows 8.0 (or older) or BlackBerry OS, you&rsquo;ll no longer be able to create a new account on your phone, or re-verify an existing account. Time for a change?</p>

<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, the Facebook-owned messaging app has said that it could stop working on these operating systems any time from 1 January 2018. So, one day soon, you might be in the middle of a WhatsApp conversation, before - *poof* - all support is gone.</p>
<p>This will affect devices that are running the very latest BlackBerry operating system &ndash; BlackBerry 10 &ndash; and Windows Phone 8.0 or older. If you want to keep using WhatsApp on Windows phones, update your software to Windows 10, if it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it may well be time to consider upgrading your smartphone sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>This latest move from WhatsApp is a sign that the company is slowly moving away from the operating systems of the past, and is focussing on more popular devices instead. Being Android and iPhone, of course.</p>
<p>While this decision to ditch Windows and BlackBerry will leave some people in the dark, it won&rsquo;t affect too many users as most of us upgrade every couple of years, and probably own either an Android or iPhone, which are both safe.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp has treated its users to a whole host of new and improved features. For example, we now have the &lsquo;<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/whatsapp-will-let-you-recall-and-delete-messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick delete</a>&rsquo; function, the universal emoji, and location-sharing services.</p>
<p>The latter is perhaps the most useful, allowing us to let people know <em>just </em>where we are at all times. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s plain to see why WhatsApp is one of the biggest messaging systems in the world.</p>
