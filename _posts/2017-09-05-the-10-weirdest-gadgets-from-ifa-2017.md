<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Weird but wonderful, these new gadgets will blow your mind.</span></p>
<p>Things are coming to a close over at the IFA 2017 in Berlin. The global tech show has given guests a sneak preview at gizmos and gadgets that&rsquo;ll soon hit the market. Among the smart devices and new games, there have been some weird gadgets that we feel the need to share with you. Yep, here are 10 new tech inventions that might just raise a few eyebrows.</p>
<h2>1) HiMirror: for Spotting Spots</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XaJe816I14o" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We all have those days when we gaze in the mirror and point out our annoying flaws. Checking out how bad our skin looks, or how huge our pores appear, can be utterly exhausting. Luckily, now there&rsquo;s a mirror that will do all that hard work for you. Yes, the HiMirror analyses your skin and lets you know just what&rsquo;s going wrong with it. It also gives you handy tips on how to improve your skincare routine. Phew.</p>
<h2>2) Kineti La Table: the Future of Coffee Breaks</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nC0DE7RUJFE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>How would you like a coffee table that doubles as a huge Windows 10 tablet? Well, that&rsquo;s just what the Kineti La Table is, as featured at IFA 2017. The stylish piece of furniture doubles as an interactive gadget that you can use with pure ease. Sure, some may say it&rsquo;s excessive to have such a large tablet built into your table, but why on earth not?</p>
<h2>3) Panasonic Ku: the Fridge that Comes to You</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7f5GLeJzEg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Just when you thought that your home couldn&rsquo;t get any &lsquo;smarter,&rsquo; someone at Panasonic thought up this neat gadget. The voice-controlled fridge is just what it says on the box. When you call this fridge, it will hear you and come to your aid, bringing drinks or whatever treats you happen to have stored inside it.</p>
<p>The device is meant to map out your home&rsquo;s floor so that it never bumps into things on its journey from the kitchen to wherever you happen to be. Just imagine yourself saying these words: &ldquo;Fridge! Bring me some more beer!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>4) Panasonic Robot Ball: Story Time Taken Care of</h2>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/H2zzwFYX22nuM" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cute-looking round robot that helps parents educate their little ones? Yes, please! Another winning gadget from the likes of Panasonic is the Robot Ball. Its friendly look and interactive capabilities are sure to make it one of the hottest gadgets in town when it&rsquo;s released. It tells stories and plays games, and will soon become your child&rsquo;s new best friend. Sadly, though, that&rsquo;s not likely to be for another 3-4 years.</p>
<h2>5) Aurai Eye Massager:</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioUGFQhvxHQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re as squeamish as I am, the very notion of an &lsquo;eye massager&rsquo; is likely enough to make you feel out of sorts. However, the idea behind this gadget is truly great. Staring at screens all day, every day is the norm for most of us. It&rsquo;s probably not the best for your eyes. So, the Aurai Eye Massager helps to ease the strain by using vibration pulses and a water circulation system to massage the area in mere minutes.</p>

<h2>6) PowerVision PowerRay: Explore the Oceans!</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4XRjbph4qo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Picture an underwater drone, and you&rsquo;ll pretty much understand what the PowerVision PowerRay has to offer. The gadget has one purpose: to explore the depths of the ocean and photograph (well, record) all it sees down there. The drone can go for four hours at a time, capturing all the weird and wonderful sights of the sea. Nice!</p>
<h2>7) Rio 60 Second Neck Toner: What Double Chin?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14861" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDKTEV_waMnnPwXKQCOINiuPJHFuIkVBdtAGlFgPoV1V9RekeYanw0iGjgIX5lWAYpiPxK4OgCS4ipCs21U5WJhP=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fighting signs of ageing one massage at a time, the Rio 60 Second Neck Toner could very well be a huge hit if it really works. The device is meant to get rid of any potential double chin you may have so long as you commit to using it for a minute each day. In short, it uses vibrations to tone up your neck muscles and help give you back your youthful neckline. What could be better than that?</p>
<h2>8) Livall Smart Helmet: The World's Smartest Bike Helmet</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5mpsvLU0Ms" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Cyclists will love this next one. The Smart Helmet connects to your mobile device and allows you to make hands-free calls as you ride. What&rsquo;s more, it can also play stereo-sound music, has an LED indicating signal, and an SOS feature on the app as well. The only slight downside is that this is a gadget that links to your mobile, rather than acting as a standalone gadget. Still, you have to admit, it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<h2>9) ESkin: A Freaky Costume for Gamers</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14862" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W9vTR1YeciewmNCjD9C4nYKe04era2zKLkOTTe6uIMxWIRRlrUevAXqCLAEvl4aZGwSQrPrne8MK1zJGBJ1dZe0r=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As the sci-fi sounding name suggests, ESkin is a crazy futuristic &lsquo;wearable&rsquo; that could have come straight out of a movie. The piece of high-tech clothing, spotted at IFA 2017, was developed by Japanese company Xenoma Inc. and can do pretty much everything from monitoring your body&rsquo;s temperature to sensing your activity. Just the type of thing that could be used in the fitness tech sphere or, indeed, as part of a gaming device.</p>
<h2>10) Panasonic Crystal TV: More Art Than Entertainment</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14863" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vYnQwkzM94g3tO1DcKANoBO6MBM8aN6w8MWHKloj35Ufj9K65547Ff2GpMyWNCf94vHkS_Iq6LD1WOCByP1rkyCB=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s this beauty&hellip; As creative as it is impressive, the Panasonic Crystal TV is worth checking out. The concept TV is the height of luxury and looks like a whopping glass shard poking out of the ground. Rather than opting for the ultra-thin design which seems to be popular right now, this model boasts a thick and clear exterior. Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s more of an art piece than it is a gadget!</p>
