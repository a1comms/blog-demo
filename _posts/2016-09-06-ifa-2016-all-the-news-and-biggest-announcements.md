<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Another epic IFA 2016 means lots of goodies to read about.</span></p>
<p>As we say Auf Wiedersehen to IFA 2016, the mahoosive annual technology show hosted in Berlin, we take a look at the hottest news and the most exciting announcements. And if you're wondering who the fiery red head is, that's Miss IFA.&nbsp;We like her.</p>
<p>From 2-7 September, many of the biggest names in the industry descended on IFA with bags full of their latest products and innovations. To save you trying to catch up on the entire event, we&rsquo;ve rounded up all the need-to-know highlights.</p>
<h2>Samsung: <em>time</em> to shine</h2>
<p>There was once a time when Sammy used IFA as a launch platform for its Note series. Seemingly, those days are no more, after the tech manufacturer held its own dedicated Note event last month.</p>
<p>So what did Samsung bring to the show in 2016? This year, it was the <em>time </em>of the smartwatch, as the new Galaxy Gear S3 was unveiled.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11432" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Gear-S3.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Gear S3" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>Following hot on the heels of 2015&rsquo;s edition &ndash; the Gear 2 &ndash; we&rsquo;re seeing much improved specs this time around, with a longer battery life and more attractive design. It runs on Samsung&rsquo;s own OS, named Tizen, in place of Android Wear.</p>
<p>In addition, the large circular AMOLED display is protected by Gorilla Glass SR+, and now features a built in speaker for calls and music playback.</p>
<h2>Sony: full of flagships</h2>
<p>IFA 2016 was a big one for the smartphone division at Sony, who announced two beautiful flagship devices: Xperia XZ and Xperia X Compact. Both boast typically gorgeous designs made from metal and glass, with curves in all the right places.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_11431" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-11431" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Sony-Xperia-XZ.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia XZ" width="600" height="266" /> Sony Xperia XZ[/caption]</p>
<p>Whilst either new Xperia will offer the top-of-the-range specs you want, the key factor to differentiate them is size. Sony Xperia XZ features a large 5.2-inch FHD display, while the Xperia X Compact sports a, you guessed it, more compact display, at 4.6-inches.</p>
<h2>Huawei: your night out sorted</h2>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a particularly quiet event for Huawei either, who took the opportunity to flaunt two new smartphones, and a new tablet too.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have Huawei Nova, dubbed the &lsquo;perfect Saturday night device&rsquo;. Confusing at first, what that means is it features an 8-megapixel camera that&rsquo;s great for selfies. Rising just above it, is Huawei Nova +, which offers many of the same experiences, in a larger 5.5-inch body.</p>

<h2>Lenovo: the flexible tablet</h2>
<p>Lenovo, the slightly more obscure brand that now owns the better-known brand Motorola / Moto, announced a plethora or goodies at IFA, including some rather delightful tablets and netbooks.</p>
<p>By far the most noteworthy is the Lenovo Yoga Book, a snazzy 2-in-1 tablet PC available on either Windows or Android. It features a nippy Intel Atom chipset, 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage. The display measures in at 10.2-inches, which makes it ideal for use as a laptop (moving on to that shortly), and offers a super-crisp 1080p Full HD resolution.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11433" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Lenovo-Yoga-Book.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Book" width="600" height="479" /></p>
<p>So what makes the Lenovo Yoga Book such a great 2-in-1 tablet PC, aside from the aforementioned spec list, is the Halo keyboard, which offers the option to type, write and draw, and is complete with haptic feedback. You might say, the Yoga Book is as flexible as the name suggests&hellip;</p>
<p>On the mobile phone side of things, Lenovo took the wrappings off a more affordable Moto Z model, called the Moto Z Play. This mid-ranger features the same design as its more powerful siblings, meaning it&rsquo;s compatible with Moto&rsquo;s cool mods.</p>
<h2>Asus: time that lasts</h2>
<p>True to form, Asus reeled out a host of new Android tablets and phablets, in addition to a new Android Wear smartwatch.</p>
<p>Called Asus ZenWatch 3, this sleek and stylish device is the first from Asus to don a circular watch face. It&rsquo;s also one of the first wearables to use the new speedy Snapdragon 2100 chipset, giving it a boost in battery performance and charging.</p>
