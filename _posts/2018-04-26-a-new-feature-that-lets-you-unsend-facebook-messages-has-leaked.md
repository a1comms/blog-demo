<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s finally happening!</span></p>
<p>The Facebook Messenger feature we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for may soon be a reality. Yes, judging by a recently leaked image, it might not be long before we have the chance to unsend messages via the app. Just imagine that kind of power.</p>
<p>With just the touch of a button, you&rsquo;ll be able to unsend those icky drunken messages you sent to your ex before they even see them. You&rsquo;ll be able to correct embarrassing spelling mistakes before the reader realises that you made them. You&rsquo;ll even be able to take back that <em>slightly </em>passive aggressive reply you sent to your flaky friend. The sky&rsquo;s the limit here.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the deal? Well, when the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal was going down, we all learned something surprising. Facebook deleted messages from Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s inbox and messages he&rsquo;d sent from other user&rsquo;s inboxes. It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17296" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qRyoY3iookqoXwpSO3v5Fmtacn7fAdXzfZJld7xMw8sGIVQdyljoIM_ba25LQtDSBoDwUYOhovkpsmmVHdqI1cLe=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the rest of us got a little upset about the whole shebang and wanted in on the action.</p>
<p>The powers at Facebook responded to this by promising us all that we&rsquo;d soon have an <em>Unsend</em> feature that everyone can use. And, it looks like it may come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17297" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X94ggFOUu-ItZFSjvyRrNmRPIFn8QoZBoxLFaXrMhRHG-VR7smS01RDV-dkOmIGM-b2tIO17ON-ZbS4M8HYDfzk=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2018/04/20/facebook-messenger-unsend-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Next Web</a> just released a screengrab, which appears to show how the delete feature will look on iOS devices. The caption on the image reads, &ldquo;Delete message? If you delete this message, no one in this conversation will be able to see it any more. This can&rsquo;t be undone.&rdquo; There are two options &ndash;&nbsp;&rdquo;Delete&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>Interesting&hellip; </em></p>
<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t know exactly how the feature will work or when it will come out.</p>
<p>However, this leak seems to suggest that it will be available in the near future. It&rsquo;s quite likely that there will be some kind of time limit on deleting messages, like we&rsquo;ve seen with other apps. Despite that, the feature is sure to be a huge hit. Watch this space!</p>
