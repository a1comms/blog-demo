<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Um, yeah&hellip; don&rsquo;t use these!</span></p>
<p>Like a person&rsquo;s diary, your password is very personal and private. For the most part, we all have a few different words that we use for just about everything. The word you use the most may have been one that you chose years and years ago. Now, you are so very used to it, you type it without having to even think.</p>
<h2>Spoiler: Many of us choose similar passwords</h2>
<p>While we all probably like to think that we are utterly individual and unique, it turns out that is not the case at all. There are some frequent phrases that pop up time and time again when it comes to passwords. Not only does this mean that we all lack imagination, but it can also make our accounts susceptible to hacking. Yikes. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want those wicked little hackers to get into your Facebook or, worse, you online banking account, you should always ensure that you have a super strong password. We already know that mixing letters with numbers helps, but what if that&rsquo;s just not enough?</p>

<p>Back in 2012, some cheeky little fella leaked the Yahoo database of passwords, which means that we can now see what the most popular ones are. If you have one of the following words as yours, you might just want to change it ASAP. Here are the top ten most popular (and therefore most hackable) passwords: </p>
<p>1. &ldquo;123456&rdquo;<br />
2. &ldquo;password&rdquo;<br />
3. &ldquo;welcome&rdquo;<br />
4. &ldquo;ninja&rdquo;<br />
5. &ldquo;abc123&rdquo;<br />
6. &ldquo;123456789&rdquo;<br />
7. &ldquo;12345678&rdquo;<br />
8. &ldquo;sunshine&rdquo;<br />
9. &ldquo;princess&rdquo;<br />
10. &ldquo;qwerty&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Why do [some] use such obvious passwords? A main reason I think is that they're either unaware of or don't understand the risks of online security," explained Dr Jeff Yan from Lancaster University when he spoke to the MailOnline."Just like everybody knows what one should do when red lights are on in the road, eventually everybody will know 123456 or the like is not a good password choice."</p>
<p>Oh, and if you don&rsquo;t use any of the above passwords, don&rsquo;t go thinking you&rsquo;re off the hook. You&rsquo;re so not. The leaked information also revealed that many users have versions of their names, ages, or birthdays as their passwords. I shouldn&rsquo;t need to tell you that these words do not make for strong passwords. People who know you can guess these in an instant, which means that you will always be in danger.</p>
<h2>If you&rsquo;re wondering, here&rsquo;s how you can choose a strong password:</h2>

<p>Got that? Online security is a massive problem, and so it&rsquo;s crucial that you do all you can to protect yourself. As much of our everyday dealings go online, protecting your passwords is certain to become a more serious issue than ever. So, please, stop using &lsquo;princess&rsquo; as your password for every account. </p>
