<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">What&rsquo;s the equivalent of 100GB data in songs or downloads? Let's find out. </span></p>
<p>Data, data, data&hellip; We all need it, but how much of it do we need? While many plans offer around the 30GB-mark, there&rsquo;s a new, awesome deal in town that may just pique your interest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a sneaky look at what you can really do when you opt to have an epic 100GB (or 100000MB) of data!</p>
<h2>Downloads, Downloads, Downloads</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the most important things most of us want from our smartphone plan is the ability to download content. No one wants to have to sit inside, using their home WiFi, just to get a new song or download a movie to their handset. Luckily, with a whopping 100GB of data, that&rsquo;s no longer a problem.</p>
<p>That amount of data means that you can download a massive 20,000 songs per month (hello, new Spotify playlist!), or around 800 apps.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on the go, you won&rsquo;t need to worry when you want to download something new. Plus, you should find that it takes mere minutes to get just what you need. Bonus.</p>

<h2>Keep in Touch Wherever, Whenever</h2>
<p>No matter where you happen to be in the world, keeping in touch with your loved ones is super important. Of course, you can always audio call your friends and family, but sometimes you really want to see their faces too.</p>
<p>In truth, there&rsquo;s something so much more intimate about video calling. When you have 100GB data, you don&rsquo;t have to keep these calls short and sweet. Instead, you can keep that call going for a whopping 230 hours. That&rsquo;s a whole load of chit-chatting!</p>

<h2>Surf the Net Freely</h2>
<p>Life is nothing without the internet. Whether you&rsquo;re checking into your favourite coffee spot on Facebook or just Googling the name of that film you can&rsquo;t put your finger on, there&rsquo;s so much to do.</p>
<p>Running out of data can be something of a nightmare, especially when it happens somewhat unexpectedly. With 100GB data, that&rsquo;s seriously unlikely to happen. You can spend 5,000 hours online without it cutting out.</p>
<p>Those of you who live for your emails will be pleased too. In fact, you can also download around 40,000 emails, should you be so popular. That means that when you&rsquo;re out of the office, you can still be sure to get all the messages you need without ever missing a beat. Let&rsquo;s be honest, checking your emails has never felt quite so efficient.</p>
