<p><span class="postStandFirst">Siri: personal assistant by name, bestower of banter by nature.</span></p>
<p>Siri recently found itself trending worldwide on Twitter, after iPhone users chanced upon one of its feistier responses, in which it completely demolishes anyone who dares to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 0&divide;0?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Siri&rsquo;s certainly no one-trick pony. Ask the right questions, and you&rsquo;ll be met with all sorts of witty and unlikely responses.</p>
<p>In some cases, asking a second or third time will yield different and equally hilarious replies.</p>
<p>So hold down the home button, work through these questions and watch Siri do its thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever fallen in love?</li>
<li>What is zero divided by zero?</li>
<li>Talk dirty to me</li>
<li>When is the world going to end?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your best chat up line?</li>
<li>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m drunk</li>
<li>Make me a sandwich?</li>
<li>What is Inception about?</li>
<li>What are you doing, Siri?</li>
<li>Why are fire trucks red?</li>
<li>Do you have a boyfriend?</li>
<li>What are you wearing?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m naked</li>
<li>Do you follow the three laws of robotics?</li>
<li>What is the meaning of life?</li>
<li>What is the best operating system?</li>
<li>Tell me a story?</li>
<li>Will you marry me?</li>
<li>Are you real?</li>
</ol>
