<p><span class="postStandFirst">Archive your WhatsApp chats by backing them up to Google Drive, and access them whenever you like, from any device.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me and my friends, WhatsApp&rsquo;s the go-to app for the majority of your texting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got group chats, for organising big get-togethers and roasting each other to the point of no return. You can send media files, for free, rather than taking the hit from your network. And something about it feels a little more friendly and socialable than traditional text messaging.</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons are for loving WhatsApp, you no doubt value some of the content contained within your chats. Be it important work info, some juicy gossip or an embarrassing picture of a mate.</p>
<p>The good news is, you can now back it all up on Google Drive, and keep hold of it for as long as you want. Your grandchildren could even revisit it years down the line, like some sort of weird and potentially massively inappropriate time capsule.</p>
<p>The bad news, however, is the Google Drive backup feature is only available to Android users right now. Apple and Windows users, sit tight.</p>
<p>So, how&rsquo;s it done?</p>
<h2>1) Update WhatsApp</h2>
<p>Head to the Google Play store and see if you&rsquo;re running on the latest version of WhatsApp. If you&rsquo;re not, update it.</p>
<h2>2) See if it&rsquo;s there</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re up to date, launch WhatsApp and go to Settings > Chats and calls, and you should spot a heading titled &lsquo;Chat backup&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>3) Back it up</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re within the &lsquo;Chat backup&rsquo; section, under &lsquo;Google Drive backup&rsquo;, you can back your messages and media files up, so even if you lose or change your phone, everything it stowed away safely.</p>
<h2>4)&nbsp;What if WhatsApp is up to date, and the option to backup isn&rsquo;t there?</h2>
<p>In all likelihood, this means the latest software update hasn&rsquo;t rolled out to your device yet. In which case, you can manually update it yourself. First of all, uninstall WhatsApp, then head to WhatsApp&rsquo;s site to download the official .apk file. Locate this file (called WhatsApp.apk) in your downloads and install it. If your handset won&rsquo;t allow you to run the install, you need to allow the installation of third party apps, which can be done in Settings > Security > Enable in the &lsquo;Unknown sources&rsquo; section.</p>
