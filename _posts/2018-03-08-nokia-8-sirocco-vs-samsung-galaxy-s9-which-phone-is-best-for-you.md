<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Need help choosing your next smartphone?</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying the fact that the upcoming <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> is set to be one of the best phones of the year. That much is obvious.</p>
<p>But, what about all the other smartphones that are coming out soon? Let&rsquo;s take a look at the newly announced Nokia 8 Sirocco too and see how the two compare with one another. It's&nbsp;Nokia 8 Sirocco vs. Samsung Galaxy S9!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be mistaken by the Nokia phones from yesteryear. They&rsquo;re long gone. This is a new era in the world of smartphones for the iconic brand.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s why Nokia has opted for such a minimal design with the 8 Sirocco. Sporting a cool Gorilla Glass 5 casing, curved edges, and a stainless-steel casing, there&rsquo;s a whole lot to love here. The device sits neatly in your hand and looks as good as it feels. It&rsquo;s a quality gadget, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16740" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ngAHWnhFYGbiIbrRy4Iw6up89llRQWsKQXDvwzVwFOcRie9wMUKVoyfXGkuFq0oSpqzsbvv9EOY2TrVMOzIIYYIr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S9 has a truly established look. It&rsquo;s the natural progression in the company&rsquo;s series, with minimal features and, of course, a huge screen. As far as colour options go, there&rsquo;s the new Lilac Purple, which is sure to draw more than a few in. With the trademark curved edges and a sleeker, more refined look, it&rsquo;s hard to say anything remotely critical about this Samsung device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16864" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A6aeA0Ktv0G7TjBrTm0lvz0IJF7bZgqMwhe_cwq9r8ifBGRu-MzEy1E0gOqsDEmlHLNb_N6vXZ6QhXCO70fx81Ye=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The only area Nokia 8 Sirocco seems to fall short is colour options, available only in black. That&rsquo;s pretty unfortunate, given that these days most devices come in an array of colours. Samsung Galaxy S9, on the other hand, could be yours in Midnight Black, Coral Blue, or Lilac Purple.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>This is a serious area of strength for Nokia 8 Sirocco, at 5.5-inches and complete with a Quad HD resolution and Plastic OLED 18:9 display. While it&rsquo;s not as large as some of the other smartphone screens we&rsquo;ve seen, it more than matches in quality.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S9 features a slightly larger screen at 5.8-inches. The almost bezeless Infinity Display adds to the modern look, and then there&rsquo;s the quality 2960 &times; 1440 resolution. Since the display is where much of Samsung&rsquo;s strengths lie, it should come as no surprise that the team has pulled off another epic one here.</p>
<p>Both devices boast Corning Gorilla Glass v5 for added strength and durability.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The two flagship phones actually have a lot in common. There&rsquo;s Qi wireless charging, fast charging, water-resistance, and a fingerprint sensor too. Nokia has decided to ditch the headphone jack on this 8 Sirocco. If you want to get Nokia&rsquo;s own Bluetooth headphones, you&rsquo;ll need to pay extra for them.</p>

<p>True to form, Samsung has held onto this aspect of its latest phone and even added the likes of stereo speakers into the mix too. That&rsquo;s not all. The phone also has an array of features including Bixby (with the new Bixby Food), DeX capabilities, and AR Emoji to boot. While the Nokia is truly a great phone, it lacks comparable extras.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Should you fancy yourself something of a pro photographer, you may just end up falling in love with the Nokia 8 Sirocco. It&rsquo;s packed with the aptly named Pro Camera, which lets you adjust images manually. You can alter the white balance, shutter speed, exposure, and more. Plus, the main 12MP camera with ZEISS optics and optical zoom is a high-end offering, to say the least. The front cam is not so impressive at 5MP, but you can&rsquo;t have it all!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16867" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/scKpMBqO3F1jzU9BIPYrQe7o-DHllVaxv4TfqvEPoX_xjnCa6g9IDbKQN8sFBfzFoKLfEVsv05WHUf-vphBbyTQqpg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, Samsung has always been known for its quality cameras, and so the 12MP rear and 8MP front cameras should come as no big surprise. There&rsquo;s also a Pro Mode and adjustable aperture feature on the Galaxy S9 too, which may well prove to be effective. So, right now, which has the greatest snapper is yet to be seen. Though with all of Samsung&rsquo;s hype around the S9 camera, we expect big things.</p>

<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk specifics. What sort of performance are we in for? Nokia 8 Sirocco has some killer storage at 128GB, alongside 6GB RAM. The processor is less impressive, since the device has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. There&rsquo;s already an upgraded chipset sported by many flagships, you might have expected better here.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy S9 with its new Exynos 9810 chipset, 64GB storage and 4GB RAM. It houses a more than adequate 3,000mAh battery with some serious user time too. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s packed with top of the range specs that you can&rsquo;t really knock.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>So, how many pennies do you need to spend to nab yourself one of these latest devices? Well, the Samsung Galaxy S9 launch price is set at &pound;739. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is slightly cheaper with a start price of around &pound;649. But we&rsquo;ll have more on this closer to its official launch!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got all the information you need, which phone is right for you? While the Galaxy S9 is already set to be one of the biggest of the year, it could be worth checking out the Nokia 8 Sirocco too before you make your decision. The phone offers many of the same specs and features as the S9 with a slightly more budget-friendly price tag!</p>
