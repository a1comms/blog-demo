<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Are you a fan of Windows Phone, the smartphone OS made by Microsoft, that supplanted Windows Mobile back in the day, and that is currently in the process of being supplanted by Windows 10 Mobile? Have you been considering making the jump to Windows 10, and found yourself looking for reasons why you should?</span></p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s take a look at the best features in Windows 10 Mobile (available, for now, in the Lumia 950 and the Lumia 950XL), and see why you might just need Windows 10 Mobile in your life...</p>
<h2><strong>Vastly improved UI customisation</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most complaints levelled at previous versions of Windows Phone was that the UI, while having brilliant utility and being easy to use, looked a bit <em>dull</em>; with those Live Tiles, and not much in the way of customisation options, your phone&rsquo;s screen was basically a collection of squares.</p>
<p>Basically, it looked more like a street map of Manhattan island than a phone UI...</p>
<p>Now, of course, the squares have returned in Windows 10 Mobile, but a couple of extra features have been included. For one, you can add a picture as the background, behind the squares; combine that with the new ability to change the opacity of the Live Tiles, making them somewhat see-through, and you end up with a front screen that has the same functionality as its predecessor, while looking <em>way</em> prettier!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Edge browser</strong></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-known, by now, that Windows 10 Mobile has a new browser. It&rsquo;s called Edge, And Microsoft has spent ages getting it right, tweaking and tinkering to give it a huge boost in performance.</p>
<p>You can take it as read that it&rsquo;s way better than Internet Explorer (although let&rsquo;s be honest, that&rsquo;s not <em>much</em> of a yardstick to measure things by), but it now does a great job standing shoulder to shoulder with the big boys, namely browser like Google Chrome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Universal apps</strong></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a big focus on apps in Windows 10 Mobile, too, with Microsoft&rsquo;s big goal being universal apps. Put simple, the goal is to make it easy to port apps from the full fat PC version of Windows 10 to the mobile version, to give both mobile and desktop users a comparable (although not completely identical, due to the vastly different screen sizes) experience across both versions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant thing, and it&rsquo;s made possible by one simple fact: Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile are basically the same operating system, which leads us onto the single coolest feature on this list...</p>
<p><a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Universal-apps.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-9809"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9809 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Universal-apps-1024x576.jpg" alt="Universal apps Windows 10" width="810" height="456" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Continuum</strong></h2>
<p><em>Many</em> words have been written about the feature known as Continuum, and there&rsquo;s a really good reason for that. Continuum isn&rsquo;t just the best feature in Windows 10, you see; rather, it&rsquo;s the realisation of a dream that&rsquo;s been bandied about for years.</p>
<p>Since the mobile and desktop versions of Windows 10 are part of the same platform, that means you can plug your Windows 10 phone into a docking station, connected to a monitor, and the operating system expands, <em>becoming the desktop version of Windows 10</em>.</p>
<p>Combine that with the idea of universal apps, and what you end up with is a full PC in your pocket. That&rsquo;s an absolutely glorious idea, and it&rsquo;s been made a reality with Windows 10 Mobile!</p>
<p><a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Continuum.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-9814"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9814" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Continuum-1024x576.jpg" alt="Continuum" width="810" height="456" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And so, as you can see, Windows 10 Mobile is good. Really very good <em>indeed</em>. If you like the sound of these features, then the conclusion is inescapable: Windows 10 might just be the operating system you&rsquo;ve been waiting for! </strong></p>
