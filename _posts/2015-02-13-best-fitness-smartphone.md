<p><span class="postStandFirst">Recent research has suggested that you might not need a fitness tracker to, well, track your fitness. You might just need a smartphone, but in that case, which is the best smartphone to choose? Join us as we take a look at our top choices for best fitness smartphone...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The smartphone world has become a little bit obsessed with health and fitness apps, but that&rsquo;s understandable really, when you consider that such things do seem to be what customers really want. We&rsquo;ve seen a load of fitness trackers hit the market, but there&rsquo;s a bit of an elephant in the room.</p>
<p>How do you take advantage of all these health and fitness features if you don&rsquo;t have, or can&rsquo;t afford, a separate fitness tracker?</p>
<p>Funnily enough, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2108876">the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> has actually been doing some research into the matter, and according to their findings, it turns out that smartphones themselves are just as good at tracking your fitness as dedicated fitness trackers. However, while that answers one question (you can just use your smartphone), it <em>raises</em> another.</p>
<p>If you want to use your smartphone, on its own, as a fitness and health tracker, which one is best?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>HTC One M8</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6247" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/4c22039e-f137-422e-a7e9-9b9879a0aafe-620x3721.jpeg" alt="4c22039e-f137-422e-a7e9-9b9879a0aafe-620x372" width="372" height="620" /></p>
<p>HTC has recently partnered up with Fitbit, and while Fitbit would very much like it if you bought one of their fitness trackers, the simple fact is that you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to. Instead, you just download the free Fitbit app, sign in or crate an account, and then tap the button that says &ldquo;Set up your phone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Voil&agrave;! Your HTC One M8 can now act as a fitness tracker without you needing to buy another accessory, and the Fitbit app can even plug itself into the BlinkFeed homescreen on the phone!</p>
<h2>LG G3</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6248" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/lg-health-app.jpg" alt="lg-health-app" width="246" height="454" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much the same story with the LG G3, although this time, the health app in question is an in-house app developed by LG. It&rsquo;s called LG Health, and it does everything you&rsquo;d expect a health and fitness app to do, but brilliantly, it does it all using the phone&rsquo;s sensors, so that you don&rsquo;t have to spend more money on a fitness tracker!</p>
<h2>Sony Lifelog</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6249" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg" alt="maxresdefault" width="524" height="295" /></p>
<p>The coolest thing about Sony&rsquo;s Lifelog app is that you don&rsquo;t actually need a Sony phone to use it. Sure, you&rsquo;ll arguably get the best experience if you&rsquo;re using a Sony Xperia Z3, say, but the Japanese manufacturer recently opened up the app to be installed on a multitude of other smartphones!</p>
<p>And so, if you want to log <em>everything</em> about your life (things like the music you listen to and the apps you use, beyond a mere count of how many steps you walk in a day), the Lifelog might just be perfect for you!</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 4</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6250" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/1.png" alt="1" width="623" height="513" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 famously has a couple of extra sensors, which none of the other phones on this list have. The first is a UV sensor, telling you how much UV light there is around you, so that you know to get out of the sun and not overdo it. The other is an SpO2 sensor, which can measure the oxygen saturation of your blood (how much oxygen it&rsquo;s carrying, basically), to make sure you maintaining healthy levels.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6251" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/HJVHF-1024x576.jpg" alt="HJVHF" width="592" height="333" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to focus on the iPhone 6 here, largely because the iPhone 6 Plus is, well, <em>bigger</em>, and it&rsquo;d therefore be a lot heavier to lug about when going for your morning run, for example. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that <em>both</em> of the current iPhones have one brilliant feature, however, which can make the whole process of monitoring your health and your fitness a lot easier. It&rsquo;s called Healthkit, and the first-party app that uses it is simply called &ldquo;Health&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The way it works is simple: the Health pulls in and aggregates data from all the other health and fitness apps on your iPhone 6, putting all the stats and data in one place, so you can more effectively manage your fitness regimen.</p>
<p><strong>And so, as you can see, not having a fitness tracker is no obstacle to keeping your health and fitness in check! While we reckon the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the iPhone 6 are arguably the best choice, the truth is that <em>any</em> phone on this list would meet your needs admirably!</strong></p>
