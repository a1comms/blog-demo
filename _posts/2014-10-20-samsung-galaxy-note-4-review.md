<p><span class="postStandFirst">Join us as we take an in-depth look at Samsung Galaxy Note 4, to see just how awesome Samsung&rsquo;s new hotness is. Is the screen as good as everyone makes it out to be? Is the S-Pen a good thing to have, or just a gimmick? Well, settle in and get ready, because it&rsquo;s time to find out...</span></p>
<p>The world, it seems, has gone mad for phablets. These big-screen beauties fly off shelves, and it gives you an idea of how popular this particular genre of device has become when even Apple changes its worldview to make one of its own, in iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>By far the most well-known range of phablets in the world is the one made by Samsung, the product line that originally created the idea of a &ldquo;phablet&rdquo;, and the latest phone in that lineage is of course Samsung Galaxy Note 4. But can this super-sized superphone live up to the memory of its predecessors? Is this the epic sequel everyone&rsquo;s been waiting for, or is it a white elephant?</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise about Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is that it&rsquo;s virtually the same size as last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note 3. That did come as a bit of a shock when the phone was first unveiled, largely because we&rsquo;d all been conditioned by years of increasing sizes into thinking that this year&rsquo;s model would follow that same trend, and be even bigger still.</p>
<p>Except it isn&rsquo;t &ndash; it comes in at only a couple of millimeters larger, with dimensions of 153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm. Although, the near-replication of size isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing; Galaxy Note 3, despite being a rather big phone, was&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;a phone that you could comfortably hold in one hand for extended periods of time if you were, say, in the middle of a phone call. The exact same thing is true in the case of Galaxy Note 4, and that&rsquo;s gratifying to see, since a phone that you can&rsquo;t hold for longer than a few minutes is a phone that fails at its main job!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the size that&rsquo;s remained more or less the same; the faux-leather finish from its predecessor makes a return on Samsung Galaxy Note 4. We&rsquo;ll admit that when Galaxy Note 3 was first unveiled, we kind of thought the same thing as many other people, namely, &ldquo;Why is the back all crinkly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After handling both that phone and this year&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the reason for that leathery finish (and note that it&rsquo;s not actual leather, instead being textured plastic) becomes apparent: it&rsquo;s there to make it a lot easier to keep a grip on the phone. It basically exists for the same reason that the &lsquo;swimming pool&rsquo; texture on Samsung Galaxy S5&nbsp;helps you to keep a grip on&nbsp;that&nbsp;phone when it gets wet.</p>
<p>That brings us onto another point about the design, and this one is less positive: during the pre-launch period, there was many a rumour scooting about, which said that Samsung Galaxy Note 4 would be water-resistant. It isn&rsquo;t, unfortunately. That lack of waterproofing is by no means a deal-breaker, of course, it&rsquo;s just something that would have been nice to see included, as a sort of extra cherry on the cake.</p>
<p>So just make sure you don&rsquo;t take it swimming with you, as unlike its smaller sibling, it&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;drown...</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6904 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15582585702_f757e6297d_z.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Design" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>While the physical body-shell of Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has remained more or less the same size, the screen is&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;the same size as its predecessor, coming in at 5.7-inches. It&rsquo;s also a Super-AMOLED screen, once again like its predecessor, so you can expect to see rich colour saturation, and incredible contrast, the kind that LCD screens can only dream of.</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking it&rsquo;s therefore the same screen, because there&rsquo;s one crucial difference: the&nbsp;<em>resolution</em>&nbsp;has changed.</p>
<p>Where Galaxy Note 3 had a 1080p display, giving it a pixel density of around 386 pixels per inch (ppi), the new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a <em>Quad-HD</em>&nbsp;(or 2K, or even 1440p, depending on what you want to call it) screen.</p>
<p>That gives this newest phablet a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;pixel density of 515ppi, second only to the mighty&nbsp;LG G3&nbsp;in terms of sharpness (and LG G3 only wins because it has a smaller screen, this meaning the pixels are packed in more tightly).</p>
<p>As for what that actually&nbsp;<em>means</em>, the pixel density isn&rsquo;t far off what you&rsquo;d find in&nbsp;<em>print</em>&nbsp;magazines, so everything will look sharper and nicer, while there&rsquo;s less potential for causing eye strain during extended periods of use.</p>
<p>One of the best parts about using any Galaxy Note phone is the fact that the screen has a digitizer built in, to work with the included S-Pen stylus. We&rsquo;ll get more into that side of things when we look at features of the phone, but suffice to say, for now, that the S-Pen is back, and it&rsquo;s even better than ever!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6905 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15581732105_c23418b752_z.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Display" width="640" height="442" /></p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, we&rsquo;ll note that this review is based on the&nbsp;<em>European</em>&nbsp;version of Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (the version the UK is getting), which uses a Snapdragon 805 processor, instead of the version with an octa-core Exynos chip. The processor it uses is, in fact, the Snapdragon 805, and in Galaxy Note 4, it&rsquo;s clocked to a&nbsp;<em>whopping</em>&nbsp;2.7GHz.</p>
<p>Combine that with the 3GB of RAM, and the fact that the phone uses a newer, more resource-friendly version of Android (namely KitKat, although it will presumably get an update to Android L in due course), and what you&rsquo;ve got here is a phone that absolutely&nbsp;<em>flies</em>.</p>
<p>Performance is&nbsp;<em>screamingly</em>&nbsp;fast, and as instantly responsive as you&rsquo;d expect from a modern flagship device. It sits right there in the top tier of superphones (it is actually one of the fastest phones we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<em>ever</em>&nbsp;seen), and the simple fact is that we really can&rsquo;t find anything to complain about, in terms of performance!</p>
<p>The Internet performance of Galaxy Note 4 is second-to-none, as well, as it uses an LTE (i.e. 4G) data connection. Granted, 4G Internet is still only available within selected areas round the UK (big cities, basically), but the service is being deployed in new areas all the time, and the Galaxy Note 4 is future-proofed to ensure that you&rsquo;re ready to rock when 4G hits your area &ndash; if it hasn&rsquo;t already!</p>
<p>Waiting times on Samsung Galaxy Note 4 are notably reduced too, as it now charges from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes. So even you can only spare a little bit of time, you know it doesn&rsquo;t take long for a top-up.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Just as the processor has been improved over the one in Galaxy Note 3, so has the camera; Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with a 16MP camera, and while that is indeed a bigger megapixel count than the 13MP camera in last year&rsquo;s phablet, the improvements don&rsquo;t end with a mere bump in numbers.</p>
<p>There are a couple of new camera features that make the whole camera experience even cooler, and the first is optical image stabilisation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there, when trying to take a photo, and it&rsquo;s windy, or you&rsquo;re swatting off seagulls, and the end result is that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to keep your hand steady;&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;is what optical image stabilisation mitigates against, keeping the lens steady, so your photos don&rsquo;t end up as a collection of streaky motion blur images.</p>
<p>The other noteworthy feature is the inclusion of a bigger 3.7MP camera on the front of the phone, used for selfies and video calling, whose higher resolution matches the increased resolution of the screen.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6907 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15579081551_d694798b5a_z.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Camera" width="640" height="489" /></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Beyond the raft of features present as part of the core operating system in every Android phone, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a nice list of&nbsp;<em>extra</em>&nbsp;features, including a couple that you won&rsquo;t find in&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;other phone.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to take a look at here is, as you might expect (not least because we mentioned it earlier), the S-Pen; that active stylus was always one of the best parts of using a Galaxy Note phone, and that remains true with Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a whole new list of cool stuff you can do with the S-Pen, from simple things like having multiple styles of pen in the S-Note app (if you fancied doing a bit of calligraphy), to the new Smart Select feature, which allows you to select content like images and text from multiple sources, all in one go, before (for example) pasting into an email to a friend. You can even instantly link to relevant apps using Smart Select, all with a couple of taps of the S-Pen!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6908 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/select_0.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Smart Select" width="589" height="570" /></p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re honest, we&rsquo;ve been fans of the added functionality the S-Pen brings, ever since the very first Galaxy Note, and with all the new features (which also include the ability to take a photo of a note, convert it to an editable object, and then add extra notes on the fly) have simply made one of the coolest ways you can interact with a phone&nbsp;<em>even cooler</em>.</p>
<p>Before we move onto the new hardware features, we&rsquo;d like to also take a moment to mention the seamless multitasking; a smartphone with multiple, resizable windows onscreen truly is a sight to behold!</p>
<p>So, on to hardware, and there are two new features we want to draw particular attention to, both of which are dedicated to health monitoring. The first is a UV sensor, the first of its kind on&nbsp;<em>any</em> mobile phone ever, and it&rsquo;s designed to monitor the levels of ultraviolet light around you, to help you ensure you don&rsquo;t get too much sun.</p>
<p>The second is the SpO2 sensor. If you&rsquo;re wondering what that does, it measures the oxygen content of your blood (using infra-red light), and offers another data point to use in your daily health monitoring via the S-Health app.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was always going to be a hard act to follow, but we&rsquo;re happy to report that Samsung Galaxy Note 4 pulls it off with aplomb! To summarise, it&rsquo;s a remarkable smartphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supremely powerful, it&rsquo;s packed with new and useful features, and that new Quad-HD screen is, quite frankly, glorious. While many phablets have hit the market since the launch of the first Galaxy Note, we reckon that Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is easily the best one yet.</p>
<p><strong>It would have been nice if it was water-resistant, sure, and we&rsquo;ll have to knock off a mark for that (as well as the fact that the higher-res screen tends to drain the battery quicker), but apart from those minor points, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is about as good as it gets!&nbsp;</strong></p>
