<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new rumour has emerged, stating that Apple is planning on making a smaller, more &ldquo;female-friendly&rdquo; (or perhaps, simply more friendly to people who like using their phone one-handed) iPhone. Said to have a 4-inch screen, this new iPhone would allegedly replace the iPhone 5c. But is the rumour true, and if it is, is there a market for such a phone?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6086" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/iphone6-34r-spgryiphone6plus-34l-spgry-flwr.jpg" alt="iphone6-34r-spgryiphone6plus-34l-spgry-flwr" width="370" height="515" /></p>
<p>After Apple did their double-headed unveiling of both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, a debate started happening online about whether they were too big for women to use easily. Many people had an opinion about that particular issue, and if a new rumour proves to be true, it seems that Apple may very well have been attention.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2866186/Is-Apple-set-launch-female-friendly-iPhone-mini-Claims-4inch-handset-sale-year.html">the Mail Online</a>, Apple is now planning to make a smaller iPhone, one that is described as being more &ldquo;female-friendly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the rumoured new iPhone beyond the fact that it will allegedly have a 4-inch screen, thus leading many people to call it a replacement for the iPhone 5c, which shares that screen size. What is also unclear is whether there&rsquo;s a market for such a phone, as the two new iPhones have been hugely successful, with the iPhone 6 Plus being an <em>enormous</em> hit in the USA.</p>
<p>However, there is precedent for this kind of thing, as some have pointed out; consider Sony, for example, who offer a shrunken-down version of the flagship Sony Xperia Z3 the aptly named Sony Xperia Z3 Compact), precisely for people who want the power of a flagship smartphone, but in a phone that&rsquo;s much easier to use one-handed.</p>
<p>Thus, while it&rsquo;s unclear whether this new mini iPhone (although &ldquo;mini&rdquo; in this case means &ldquo;the same size the normal iPhones were, up till this year&rdquo;) will happen, we can imagine that there is indeed a market for it.</p>
<p><strong>On thing&rsquo;s for sure, though: it&rsquo;s certainly going to be interesting to see how this plays out. Stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
