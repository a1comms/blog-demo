<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Spoiler: The concept is awesome!</span></p>
<p>The future is foldable. A couple of weeks ago, the powers at Samsung announced one of their most exciting smartphones to date as part of its Unpacked event.</p>
<p>Yes, the brand is soon to launch the much-awaited <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/all-the-incredible-highlights-from-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Fold</a>; a true phablet that you can fold into either a 4.6-inch device or a larger 7.3-inch tablet. That&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>Huawei has also got in on the action here, releasing the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/the-foldable-future-is-here-with-huawei-mate-x." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mate X</a>. The Chinese company&rsquo;s version of a foldable smartphone works in a similar way. Sporting a precision-engineered hinge, the phone can fold flush into itself. All in all, it&rsquo;s a neat looking machine.</p>
<p>With these two major brands releasing foldable devices, the obvious question has to be: when is Apple going to get on board?</p>
<p>While there have previously been rumours that the company is <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/apple-is-working-on-a-futuristic-foldable-iphone-for-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on a foldable device</a>, nothing concrete has been confirmed. However, luckily for us, we recently got a glimpse of how a foldable iPhone <em>could </em>look.</p>

<h2>iPhone X Fold Concept</h2>
<p>Can you imagine a foldable iPhone? Now you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Recently leaked pictures seem to show how a design from the major brand may work. The concept render was created by Dutch designer, <a href="https://www.roygilsing.com/?portfolio=iphone-x-fold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Gilsing</a>, for the publication Foldable News. Much like other foldable devices, this one appears to bend on a hinge in the middle of the larger screen.</p>
<p>The snazzy looking phone would have two displays &ndash;&nbsp;a 1:3 aspect ratio as the tablet screen and a foldable display with a 2:3 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you popped this particular design next to the likes of the Huawei Mate X or Galaxy Fold, it certainly would not look out of place. However, there are some flairs that look positively Apple-esque, such as the classic notch.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this particular design is how it could be used. One of the rendered images shows the foldable device being used much like a laptop, with the hinge at a 90-degree angle and the bottom half acting as a keyboard.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that this design has absolutely nothing to do with Apple.</p>
<p>It is merely a concept, created by a third party. Gilsing was asked to imagine the design for Foldable News and, as a result, came up with a plausible look. Still, it&rsquo;s impressive.</p>

<h2>Your Move, Apple!</h2>
<p>So, what does the future hold and can we see a foldable iPhone in our crystal balls?</p>
<p>Well, what happens next is entirely up to the good folk in Cupertino. Until now, no one from the company has officially announced anything. So, we can&rsquo;t actually be sure what they have up their sleeves.</p>
<p>However, with other leading brands launching foldable devices, it wouldn&rsquo;t be outlandish to expect Apple to follow suit.</p>
