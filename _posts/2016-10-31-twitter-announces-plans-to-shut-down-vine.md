<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Watch six of our favourite videos below in memory of Vine.</span></p>
<p><strong>Updated: Vine as we know and love it shuts down on 17/01/2017. Replacing it is Vine Camera, which posts your six-second videos directly to Twitter, or saves them to your camera roll. Make sure you download your Vine videos before it shuts down!</strong></p>
<p>If you love nothing more than creating and sharing short, hilarious videos with the world, we have some seriously sad news for you. Twitter recently announced that it&rsquo;s shutting down the video sharing app, Vine, in the coming months.</p>
<p>This latest move comes sharply after Twitter announced it would be letting 9% of its workforce go. It seems that the social media giant is looking for ways in which to trim the company fat, and Vine appears to be adding too much weight.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the PR guys at Twitter said in an official blog post: &ldquo;Nothing is happening to the apps, website or your Vines today. We value you, your Vines and are going to do this the right way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to access and download your Vines. We&rsquo;ll be keeping the website online because we think it&rsquo;s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twitter bought Vine back in 2012 from founder, Rus Yusupov. The app then went live in January 2013, and brought video sharing to the already successful Twitter platform.</p>
<p>Adding a new dimension to Twitter, users could do more than just Tweet their thoughts. They could express them through short clips of video, with some hilarious results to show for it. Here are six of our favourite Vine videos.</p>
<h2>1) Star Wars&nbsp;Cantina Band Theme</h2>

<h2>2)&nbsp;Kingbach to the rescue</h2>

<h2>3)&nbsp;Would You Miss Your Mum?</h2>

<h2>4)&nbsp;Party UP HERE!</h2>

<h2>5)&nbsp;Turnip for What!</h2>

<h2>6)&nbsp;Rooster Fight</h2>

<p>Clearly, with such a large user following, the closure of Vine comes as something of a shock.</p>
<p>Yusupov took to Twitter, naturally, to express his regrets around the gloomy news. In just one tweet, he conveyed a warning to any young entrepreneurs looking to follow in his footsteps. So, what was his advice?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don&rsquo;t sell your company!</p>
<p>&mdash; Rus (@rus) October 27, 2016</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Vine officially shuts down 17/01/2017, and users are being encouraged to download their videos before it does.&nbsp;So, in a way, a little piece of the app will live on long after the end - if only on our hard drives.</p>
