<p>Is there an old, forgotten smartphone sat in your drawer, gathering dust? Yes? Then you're sitting on a potential new gadget that could be used for no end of possibilities.</p>
<p>We've thought of five fun and creative ways to put your old smartphone to use, so it's not wastefully taking up drawer space. Whether you've got an old iPhone or Android, you can apply these tips and tricks to pretty much any phone.</p>
<h2>1) The Ultimate Car Fixture</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12711" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/car-mount-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="346" /></p>
<p>Get yourself a car dashboard mount and you can turn your old mobile into a permanent car fixture. It could operate as a sat nav (using Maps, Google Maps etc.), an MP3 player for streaming music (Spotify, Apple Music etc.) and, if you've got Bluetooth integrated into your car, you'll be able to take hands-free calls too.</p>
<h2>2) A Universal Remote</h2>

<p>The number of remote controls we have in our homes is getting ridiculous. With every new must-have media contraption, with it comes paired yet another remote to keep track off. It's a nightmare.</p>
<p>With the right app, though, you can consolidate all of your remote controls into just one: your old smartphone. Peel Smart Remote is one of the best universal remote apps, giving you control of Wi-Fi connected devices like your TV, DVD player, Apple TV and speakers. There are more options out there; just head to the App Store or Google Play and search 'universal remote' to see.</p>
<p>There are even apps to control your games consoles from your phone, like Xbox One SmartGlass.</p>
<h2>3) The Kids' Play Thing</h2>

<p>If you've got little ones, you've no doubt already realised their obsession with playing apps, taking photos and generally exploring every corner of your mobile phone. You'd rather they weren't using yours, let's face it, so why not turn your old phone into one that your children can play with. Cram it full of age-appropriate apps to keep them happy, and place restrictions on what they can and can't download themselves.</p>
<h2>4) Your Standalone Digital Camera</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12710" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/How-to-turn-your-old-iPhone-into-a-super-gadget.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Since most smartphones these days have great cameras, even previous generations going back a couple of years, it seems a waste to not take advantage, and turn your old phone into a standalone digital camera.</p>
<p>Perform a factory reset on your old mobile and you should be left with a load of storage space, ready for all your photos and videos. You could even accessorise and upgrade your camera with a cool lens kit from Amazon.</p>
<h2>5) A Baby Monitor / CCTV Camera</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12707" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/Presence.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="533" /></p>
<p>The security-conscious among you will want to convert your old smartphone into a smart security camera. With an app like Presence, you can pair two devices, using one as the camera, and the other to live stream the footage.</p>
<p>But you don't have to sit and watch the stream to catch anything suspect. Motion detected by your old phone alerts your new one, so you can check up as and when something happens. You could use Presence to turn your old phone into anything from a baby monitor to a pet cam to a surveillance cam.</p>
<p>A little creative thinking can go a long way&hellip; But, if you'd rather, you could trade your old phone in for a load of money. <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/trade-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compare the best trade-in prices to get the most cash</a>.</p>
