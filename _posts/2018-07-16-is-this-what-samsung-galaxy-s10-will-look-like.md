<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Revealing video could show us the next Galaxy S series phone!</span></p>
<p>What will Samsung&rsquo;s next phone look? It&rsquo;s an interesting question but not one we have a solid answer to yet. Could&nbsp;we see a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> or Galaxy X?</p>
<p>While the next Galaxy S flagship won't be launched until 2019, there&rsquo;s still a lot of speculation out there. Oh yes, rumours are rife! But there&rsquo;s one video, which has been created by the likes of DBS Designing, that might give us visual insight into the next Galaxy S series.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uPZtGMOHofI" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time we&rsquo;ve seen theories about this particular device. In fact, recent leaks have shown a mysterious full-screen Samsung phone in a wide range of colours. This latest peek into what the next device may look like could shed further light on what we can expect when the phone is finally released.</p>
<p>Shiny and sleek, the clip shows an ultra-thin bezel-less (all-screen) design, which appears to have a fingerprint scanner integrated into the screen. Of course, one of the major rumours we&rsquo;ve heard about the next Samsung device is that it may have its first ever &lsquo;under the screen&rsquo; fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deal with the elephant in the room. This description so far sounds a little iPhone X esque, but there&rsquo;s one major difference. There&rsquo;s no notch in sight. Instead, it&rsquo;s a <em>completely </em>screen-to-screen look. If the next Samsung does turn out to look like this, it&rsquo;s all set to be something of a crowd-pleaser.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when the clip takes a close look at the bottom half of the phone, there is in fact a headphone jack. When the phone design turns around and we see the back of the device, there are three camera lenses stacked vertically. That would be a real step forward &ndash; current Samsung devices have only two lenses.</p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get your heart racing with excitement, there&rsquo;s more. While the video starts off looking at a plain black device, towards the end of the clip, there are a few more additions to the lineup. If this clip is anything to go by, the device will come in black, white, purple, and a burgundy colour.</p>
<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t know much about the phone as the powers at Samsung are fairly tight-lipped. Nothing has been confirmed, which means that the next device could be exactly like the one we&rsquo;ve seen in the video, or... be a completely different phone. To find out, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until 2019. Tick tock.</p>
