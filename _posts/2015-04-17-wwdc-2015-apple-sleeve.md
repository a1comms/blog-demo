<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple is due to take the stage at WWDC 2015 in June, so it&rsquo;s time to take a look at the rumours so far, and try to work out what might be unveiled at the event.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6577" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Apple-WWDC-2015.png" alt="Apple WWDC 2015" width="720" height="563" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rapidly approaching that time of year, when Apple takes to the stage at its own Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), and with the date set for June, people&rsquo;s thoughts are naturally turning towards what we might see the Cupertino giant unveil.</p>
<p>The first question people invariably ask is, of course, whether we&rsquo;ll see a new iPhone...</p>
<p>However, the consensus amongst various commentators online is that this is unlikely to happen; iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were only announced in September of 2014, so it is unlikely that we&rsquo;ll see a new phone until that time <em>this</em> year (at a dedicated event, rather than as part of a developer-focused event). It is much the same situation with new iPads, as well.</p>
<p>What we <em>are</em> likely to see, however, is the next version of iOS, namely iOS 9, as that&rsquo;s something which developers will need to get their hands on early, to ensure their apps take advantage of any new features in the new version.</p>
<p>So, what new features can we expect to see in iOS 9, if it does indeed get unveiled?</p>
<p>There is no confirmation of what new stuff will be included, as of yet, but there have been a number of rumours published online already.</p>
<p>They may be disappointing for people expecting spangly new game-changing features, however, as all the rumours point toward iOS 9 being more focused on improving stability and hardware optimisation.</p>
<p>Those might not be headline-grabbing changes, but they&rsquo;re nonetheless a good sign, as anything that improves the experience of using a smartphone has to be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>WWDC 2015 is set to happen in June, and we will have more news as it happens, so stay tuned!</strong></p>
