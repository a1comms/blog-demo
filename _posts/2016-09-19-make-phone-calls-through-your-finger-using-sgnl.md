<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">VIDEO BELOW: Sgnl&nbsp;takes the crown as the coolest Kickstarter project. Ever.</span></p>
<p>Kickstarter has long had a penchant for uncovering some of the most bad-ass tech projects around, like the <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/power-your-phone-like-a-jedi-using-this-levitating-charger" target="_blank">levitating phone charger</a> that, we&rsquo;re pretty sure, runs on Jedi powers.</p>
<p>But the latest Kickstarter coup is so next-level awesome, it unlocks hidden bonus levels no one knew existed. Called Sgnl, presumably because the creators were paying by the letter, this device lets you answer phone calls through your finger tip. We jest you not.</p>
<p>Worn on your wrist, Sgnl talks to your mobile phone via Bluetooth, much like a smartwatch, and it knows when you&rsquo;re receiving a call. But here&rsquo;s where things get interesting; through some new brand of dark arts, Sgnl then transmits your call through your finger and into your ear.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11599" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/Snape.jpg" alt="snape" width="600" height="379" /></p>
<p>As with any impressive trick, there&rsquo;s always a very practical explanation behind it. In the case of Sgnl, it isn&rsquo;t smoke and mirrors, but <em>science</em>. Apparently, when the wrist strap receives a voice signal from your phone, it generates vibrations that then transmit through your hand all the way to your fingertip. Place it in your ear and the vibrations echo to create amplified sound. Ipso facto, phone calls through your fingers.</p>

<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s a very real and serious danger of being likened to iconic 80s alien, ET, you won&rsquo;t have time to care, because you&rsquo;ve become a total rock star who takes calls through their finger. The strap even connects to your smartwatch (and classic watch), so there&rsquo;s no end to the amount of tech wizardry you could have occurring on your wrist.</p>

<p>As with all Kickstarter projects, there are different levels of pledges you can make to get your hands on Sgnl. Unfortunately for you, if you&rsquo;re only just learning about this now, you&rsquo;ve missed the early bird rates. Last time we checked, though, you could secure a Sgnl wrist strap for a cool $239 dollars (around &pound;185). All prices can be found on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sgnlstrap/sgnl-make-phone-calls-with-your-fingertip" target="_blank">Sgnl&rsquo;s Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
<p>According to said page, Sgnl&rsquo;s estimated delivery date is February 2017.</p>
