<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Another stunner from Sony, with not one, but <em>two</em> formidable cameras.</span></p>
<p>It seems that the Xperia Z range&rsquo;s reign has come to an end, having paved the way for a new series of flagships. The first instalment of which has been dubbed Sony Xperia X.</p>
<p>This state-of-the-art device continues and reinvigorates the svelte legacy left by the Z line, in the form of another glass and metal marvel with killer specs to boot. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what Sony has achieved with the Xperia X.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Keeping in touch with previous high-tier Sony handsets, the Xperia X takes on a premium and downright classy approach.</p>
<p>The device is clad in a metal and glass body, complete with Sony&rsquo;s signature omni-balance design, meaning the handset is perfectly weighted, achieving a level of balance not even the Karate Kid is capable of. Soft, plastic edges add a little extra comfort on top.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The front of the handset houses a beautiful 5-inch IPS HD display. While it &lsquo;only&rsquo; offers 1080p output, the screen is clear, crisp and has fantastic colour reproduction.</p>
<p>The display packs in 441 pixels per inch, which is maximised through Sony's TRILUMINOS and X-Reality screen tech &ndash; the very same that&rsquo;s used in Sony&rsquo;s epic Bravia Televisions.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Inside the device beats the heart of a hexa-core Snapdragon 650, and a generous helping of 3GB RAM. Sony Xperia X isn&rsquo;t as powerful as HTC 10 and LG G5, both of which have more advanced processors, though this combination does offer a snappy and fluid user experience, and will handle most tasks and apps with ease.</p>
<p>On top of the processing power is a slimmed down version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with a near stock offering. In other words, there&rsquo;s less manufacturer input, and more Google goodness.</p>

<p>All of which is powered by a 2620mAh battery that Sony claims can offer up to two days battery life. Presumably, that&rsquo;s less likely to be true if you&rsquo;re glued to your Xperia X all day, devouring power-hungry content, but seemingly not unreasonable for moderate use.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The Xperia X really excels when it comes to imaging, as if often the case with Sony smartphones.</p>
<p>Starting with the front-facing camera, Sony has added a wide angle F2.0 Exmor RS 13MP unit. This camera offers amazing lowlight capabilities and a wide field of vision&hellip; so when you&rsquo;re busting some shapes on the dance floor, and want to take the obligatory drunken selfie, it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>The rear of the handset features the more advanced of the two snappers, amounting to a 23MP Exmor RS wide-angle G lens module (wow, that&rsquo;s a mouthful), that&rsquo;s ready to capture all of your magic moments in superb quality.</p>

<p>This rear-facing camera essentially offers all of Sony&rsquo;s imaging wizardry, which includes superior low-light capture, 5x clear image zoom and Full HD video recording.</p>
<h2>Connectivity &amp; Sensors</h2>
<p>Inside Sony Xperia X, you&rsquo;ll find the usual connectivity options, such as GPS+, Bluetooth v4.2, Google Cast support and NFC. This handset also boasts a fingerprint scanner, conveniently built in to the power button, allowing you to access content more quickly and securely.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>With 32GB of internal storage as standard, there&rsquo;s ample room for your apps, music and video files. And if it isn&rsquo;t, the option to expand via a micro SD gives you another 200GB to play with. Sony Xperia X also sports stereo speakers, housed intuitively on the front, and supports clear audio+. In addition, PS4 Remote Play opens up the power to play your favourite PlayStation games on your mobile.</p>

<p>It really is beautiful, yet elegantly simply design, with enough horsepower and technical nous to keep even the most demanding users satisfied.</p>
