<p>&lsquo;Modular technology&rsquo; is as much a buzz word in 2016 as &lsquo;VR&rsquo;, with big players in the industry rolling the tech out into the mass market for us all to enjoy.</p>
<p>But what is modular technology? And&nbsp;what does it mean for the smartphone industry?</p>
<p>The idea of a modular device came into the limelight in 2013. The brainchild of Dutch designer Dave Hakkens, this device was aptly dubbed &ldquo;phonebloks&rdquo;, and was a modular smartphone with two philosophies: one to reduce electronic waste, and two to offer the consumer a customisable and unique smartphone experience.</p>
<p>This idea was so well received by the industry that search giant Google, and its then owned company Motorola, announced Project Ara &ndash; the first consumer-ready, fully modular device. Although Ara has hit a few snags, undergone many changes and in turn lost Motorola, the design, technology and concept has lived on and is due to hit the market at the end of 2016.</p>
<p>However, the rocky road that Google has been on hasn&rsquo;t stopped other big players in the mobile industry taking their own steps into modularity, with some incredible devices emerging, the biggest of which from LG and Lenovo.</p>
<h2>LG and all its Friends</h2>
<p>LG is the first mainstream manufacturer to release a modular smartphone, coming in the form of the mighty LG G5 and its Friends.</p>
<p>Not only is this device one of the most powerful smartphones on the market, but it also boasts the ability to upgrade the phone through the use of modular &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10606" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Break-The-Mould.jpg" alt="Break-The-Mould" width="600" height="431" /></p>
<p>These modules include a cam grip that adds additional shooting controls and extra battery, and a B&amp;O audio module that allows for 32bit DAC output, meaning that your music will sound phenomenal.</p>
<p>With more modules in the pipeline, LG G5 is an incredible handset that can be made even better with use of its &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Moto Mods are rocking</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels of the G5 are a pair of devices that Lenovo hope will change the value and functionality of smartphones. Earlier this month, tech mammoth Lenovo announced the next generation of Moto phones: the Moto Z and Moto Z Force.</p>
<p>These premium devices are a pair of flagship smartphones that&nbsp;only differ slightly from one another, but both offer a form of modularity through a magnetic modular connectivity port and a host of Moto Mods.</p>
<p>These Mods are, in essence, magnetic back plates that link through a smart connector and add additional hardware and features, all the while looking like snazzy cases.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10607" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Moto-Mods.jpg" alt="Moto Mods" width="600" height="413" /></p>
<p>The Mods available at present consist of bigger batteries, speakers and even a Pico projector for enjoying content on your phone in a big-screen format. The design of the Moto Z&rsquo;s and the Moto Mods allows for a simple and effective modular experience.</p>
<p>Although this technology is in its infancy, these big players, along with Google and Ara, will usher in a new age of smartphones by offering the consumer a different take and advancement in technology, with the end goal that your mobile phone really will become an all-in-one device.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s an exciting time to be alive, because modular devices allow endless possibilities and bring something fresh and exhilarating to the industry, and over time, the only restrictions are likely to be the reach of our own creativity.</strong></p>
