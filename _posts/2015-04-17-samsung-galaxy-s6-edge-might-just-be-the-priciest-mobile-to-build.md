<p><span class="postStandFirst">Analysts have completed a cost analysis of Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, and in doing so, have found out that it&rsquo;s possibly the most expensive phone to manufacture. Comparing that cost to build with consumers&rsquo; cost to purchase might just prove this phone to be the bargain of the year...</span></p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy S6 edge is one of the most eye-catching smartphones we&rsquo;ve seen in a <em>long</em> time, and a bit part of why it&rsquo;s so appealing is that gorgeous wraparound screen. However, features like that are expensive to make.</p>
<p>And now, thanks to Recode, we know that Galaxy S6 edge is, in fact, <em>very</em> expensive to make, costing more than even the super-sized iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>During a tear-down of the phone&rsquo;s components, analysts looked at what parts Samsung used, and then factored in things like labour costs, in order to come out with an overall cost to build of around $290 (around &pound;194). That makes it notably more expensive to build than last year&rsquo;s Galaxy S5, iPhone 6, and the aforementioned iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>It also presumably makes it more expensive than Samsung Galaxy S6, because the <em>most</em> expensive component was, as you might expect, the wraparound screen; experts say this screen costs Samsung $85 (just under &pound;57) to use.</p>

<p>In addition to the screen, analysts found that the phone&rsquo;s RAM is expensive, as Galaxy S6 edge uses DDR4 memory, more advanced and efficient than the DDR3 memory found in, say, iPhone 6.</p>
<p>The conclusion we have to reach from this is that, while Galaxy S6 edge is a little more expensive than those rivals mentioned above, there is a <em>very</em> good reason for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <em>relentlessly</em> high-end, premium phone, one that (if Samsung hadn&rsquo;t take a cut its profits to make the phone more affordable) <em>should</em> be a lot more expensive for us consumers than it actually is.</p>
<p><strong>When you look at it like that, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge might just be the bargain of the year!&nbsp; </strong></p>
