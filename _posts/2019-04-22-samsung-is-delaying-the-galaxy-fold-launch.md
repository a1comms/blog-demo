<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The company made an official announcement this week!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re keenly awaiting the first foldable smartphone to hit the market, you may have to wait a little longer than expected.</p>
<p>Yes, after officially announcing the Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphone back in February, Samsung has made the choice to delay its release.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r_UgNcJtzQ?start=65" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The groundbreaking smartphone was originally supposed to hit stores this week. However, after getting feedback from reviewers on the device, the company has decided to push that date back to get them a little more development time.</p>
<p>Despite the slight hold-up, Samsung have said that it's &lsquo;encouraged by the excitement around the Galaxy Fold so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While many reviewers shared with us the vast potential they see, some also showed us how the device needs further improvements that could ensure the best possible user experience,&rdquo; says the official <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-postpone-the-launch-of-the-galaxy-fold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> from Samsung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold. We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Samsung Are Perfecting the Hinge</h2>
<p>So, why is there a hold-up here? It has something to do with the all-important hinge design.</p>
<p>The company officials say that it will be investigating how the display could be impacted by the &lsquo;top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge&rsquo;. Put simply, that means that Samsung will be perfecting the screen, despite the fact that it can fold right down the middle.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Since the foldable tech is brand new, the strength of the screen is absolutely crucial. That&rsquo;s why the developers will also be looking into how it can strengthen the display protection as much as possible. All of the above is geared towards making sure that we get the &lsquo;best possible user experience&rsquo;. Nice.</p>
