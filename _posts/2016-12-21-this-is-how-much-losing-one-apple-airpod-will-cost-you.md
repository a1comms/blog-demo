<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You probably don't want to lose your AirPods.</span></p>
<p>Always looking to streamline and simplify where possible, Apple took a bold move by dispensing with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on iPhone 7, and instead integrated the support for headphones into the charging port.</p>
<p>Doing so could've caused a problem for iPhone 7 users, seeing as their existing headphones aren't designed to plug into an iPhone charging port&hellip; Apple, though, wasn't just going to leave you hanging.</p>
<p>Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ships with a pair of new Lightning port connector earphones (that work by plugging into the charging port), as well as an adapter that allows users to also plug in and use any standard 3.5mm jack headphones too. All bases covered.</p>

<p>But we think Apple's motivated by more than just design efficiency. With the upcoming release of the Cupertino company's AirPods, is it possible that Apple's trying to divert the mainstream towards a more advanced method of consuming music?</p>
<p>AirPods look like the now-iconic earphones that come boxed with iPhones, except they're wireless, completely negating the need of a headphone jack entirely.</p>
<p>After setting them up, AirPods are automatically on and always connected to your iPhone. They can sense when they're in your ears, and will pause your music when you take them out. Of course, AirPods tap into Siri, so you change your music track or volume, make a call or ask for directions somewhere.</p>

<p>And if you were worrying about battery life - don't. Apple's AirPods offer an 'industry-leading' 5 hours of listening time. When they're drained, all they require is a quick 15-minute charge to refuel up to 3 hours of go time.</p>
<p>Getting on to the cost, which we're sure you're desperate to know by now, a pair of AirPods come in at a reasonable &pound;159.00. And to replace one of them? Well, bearing in mind the size of these earphones and lack of wires, losing them seems like a real possibility, one that will cost you &pound;65 per AirPod.</p>
<p>The charging case included with your AirPods should see you don't lose them when they're not in use. But should one bury itself down the back of the sofa to forever remain unseen, AirPods do work independently of each other. So, every cloud&hellip;</p>
