<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple fans, it's finally time to start getting excited again.</span></p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) is a developer-focused event, where a load of technology enthusiasts get together to talk about all things Apple. In short, it&rsquo;s a chance for officials to share some of their upcoming software plans with the world and, particularly, developers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really not far away, now. WWDC17 will be taking place at the McEnery Convention Center, in San Jose, 5-9 June. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13244" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IY37hWaw2BTLsZX_1nPdXsucWyyRx1F46UpfufXr_vIwdXK1JXK_NuIehPcQUEn2zeAwGlvF1R7Zse4Vg04Zpy2OcQ=s0" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<h2>The Setting</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that this year&rsquo;s Apple event is so exhilarating is because 2017 will be the first in 15 years that Apple officials have held its WWDC at the San Jose venue. In fact, in recent years, they&rsquo;ve preferred San Francisco's Moscone West as their location of choice. It could be that there are some huge announcements coming our way at this conference.</p>

<h2>What Can You Expect at WWDC17?</h2>
<p>So, now that you know what the conference is, and <em>where </em>it is, let&rsquo;s talk about what we can expect at WWDC17. In the past, Apple officials have not only released information about their software at these events; they have also teased hardware changes too. If you just can&rsquo;t wait to see what the company&rsquo;s geniuses do next, paying close attention to any reports from this event might just be the way forward.</p>
<p>We anticipate some pretty big updates to Apple&rsquo;s three big software platforms: iOS (iPhone), Watch OS (Apple Watch) and macOS (Macs), including a brand-new Mac too.</p>
<h2>The One You&rsquo;re Waiting for: iOS 11</h2>
<p>We already know that iOS 11 will be out later this year, and it&rsquo;s likely to be massive, which means that Apple is more than likely to spend a sizable portion of the conference showcasing the features of their latest system.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13241" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eJs7tSh1Lj-KXsYiAxVB4l8gANZP6wcp9fbB0BltnYCq4IrCSXLwuKCxKb-gmGwFRKlmhBSVapHHQG0PFTMhoI6HsA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As yet, we&rsquo;re not entirely sure what the deal will be with the latest OS. We do know that it may have a &lsquo;Dark Mode&rsquo; which will prevent users from hurting their eyes when they use phones and tablets during the twilight hours.</p>
<p>Some sources have also suggested that Apple is&nbsp;currently working on &lsquo;enhanced social features&rsquo; for iOS 11. What that could mean is open to interpretation right now. The likelihood is that the developers will be creating faster and more streamlined ways of allowing users to stay in touch with one another. From social media apps to messaging services, there&rsquo;s a whole load of things that we will want to keep our eyes out for when the latest iOS platform launches.</p>

<p><strong>When will iOS 11 be announced? </strong>Likely on the first day of the WWDC 2017 event.</p>
<p><strong>When will iOS 11 be available? </strong>Approximately September.</p>
<h2>Watch OS 4</h2>
<p>Of course, with wearable tech becoming more and more popular, it would make sense that Apple will also talk about Watch OS 4, the system that the third series of watches will likely use. The new Watch 3 will be released either at the end of 2017 or the start of 2018. It should be interesting to see what the Apple team has planned for launch.</p>

<h2>Rumour: A brand new MacBook</h2>
<p>While many users are still getting used to the latest MacBook and MacBook Pro, they might not have to wait all that long for the next gen of laptops. It wouldn&rsquo;t be completely out of the realms of possibility for Apple to tease a new product at the event. Since it seems that it could be the Macbook&rsquo;s turn for something of an upgrade, it&rsquo;s fair to speculate that it could be the latest preview. The team will surely also be talking about the latest macOS update and how they plan to develop the current system. Watch this space!</p>
