<p><span class="postStandFirst">Amazon is being super nice and wants to give you loads of free apps.</span></p>
<p>Amazon has just launched a pretty rad shopping app that promises to deliver usually chargeable apps and games, for <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>Called Underground, Android users have access to over $10,000 (roughly &pound;6,500) of apps, games and in-app purchases, all of which are &lsquo;actually free&rsquo;, as Amazon puts it.</p>
<p>The retail giant has allegedly devised a new business model with app developers, where it pays them on a per-minute played basis, in return for waiving the standard charges we all hate.</p>
<p>In other words, Amazon is picking up the bill on this one.</p>
<p>Underground looks to offer some (semi) popular titles, including apps like <em>Frozen Free Fall</em>, <em>Star Wards Rebels: Recon Missions</em> and <em>Angry Birds Slingshot Stella</em>.</p>
<p>Because of Google Play Store&rsquo;s weird rules, you&rsquo;ll have to download Amazon Underground directly from Amazon&rsquo;s site.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unless you own a Fire HD or Fire HDX tablet, which both get the free apps automatically.</p>
<p>If the apps currently on offer in Underground don&rsquo;t interest you, it could be worth checking back. Amazon has labelled this as &lsquo;long-term program&rsquo;, with more benefits to come in the future.</p>
