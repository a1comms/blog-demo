<p><span class="postStandFirst">Join us as we take a look at the newest phone to be pegged as &ldquo;the iPhone-Killer&rdquo;, in Samsung Galaxy Alpha. How nice is the new industrial design? Is the phone as powerful as it should be? Does the 720p screen stand up well against its 1080p rivals? Read on to find out...</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long been known that the existence of the iPhone (as in the original iPhone) sent a shockwave through the industry, causing a lot of what we take for granted in the modern smartphone arena.</p>
<p>That fact helped to build up the legend of the iPhone, and as with all legends, it&rsquo;s only natural that&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;manufacturers would want to make phones that can beat the iPhone at its own game.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Alpha, in the simplest possible terms, is being dubbed as the Korean manufacturer&rsquo;s iPhone-Killer. Does it succeed in that mission? Let&rsquo;s find out...</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Alpha marks something of a departure for Korean manufacturer Samsung, as it&rsquo;s a phone whose marketing hasn&rsquo;t really focused on the technology nestled away inside the phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a smartphone that, in its marketing at least, seems to be trading first and foremost on its&nbsp;<em>looks</em>, and on the thing that the iPhone still has in spades, namely its perceived &lsquo;cool factor&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To put it in slightly more acerbic tones, if Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the big, uber-powerful beastie aimed at smartphone nerds, Samsung Galaxy Alpha is the fashionistas&rsquo; phone.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s a good job that Samsung Galaxy Alpha is really rather pretty, with elegant lines, and a slim body that looks genuinely mouth-watering (the phone is, in fact, just 6.7mm thin, making it one of the slimmest smartphones currently available in the UK, and easily the slimmest Galaxy phone ever made).</p>
<p>It is, however (and this does need to be noted), hauntingly reminiscent of the phone from which it&rsquo;s wanting to steal customers; rather than the gently curving back plates of phones like Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Alpha is more straight-edged, with large, flat surfaces and a look that perhaps is best described as &lsquo;iconically rectangular&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The chamfered edges of the metal band that slips elegantly round the sides of the phone also draw comparison with the iPhone range, leaving no doubt at whom this phone is targeted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a departure from what we&rsquo;ve seen in recent Samsung flagships, but it&nbsp;<em>works</em>, and the end result is a phone that&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye, whilst incredibly compact in the hand.</p>
<p>While it may appear that Samsung has simply decided, &ldquo;<em>Let&rsquo;s make it look like the iPhone</em>&rdquo; and called it a day, some genuine thought has gone into the design of the phone, best shown off by one little touch that we want to draw attention to: on the metal band that runs round the whole phone, there are flared sections on the corners, that rise up away from the body of the phone.</p>
<p>They exist to make it less likely for your fingers to slip off the edges when holding the phone, and its little touches like that which make it easy to say that the design of the Samsung Galaxy Alpha is a triumph!</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>If one were inclined to make comparisons between this and iPhone 6 (which, to be honest, everyone on the internet has done) to try and prove Samsung Galaxy Alpha is aimed at stealing away users from Apple, then one need look no further than the screen, since it measures the exact same 4.7-inches as Apple&rsquo;s new flagship.</p>
<p>We find it hard to believe that&rsquo;s accidental...</p>
<p>Of course, the big question is this: is the screen any good? Well the simple answer is that, yes, it&rsquo;s a Samsung, so of course it is.</p>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s Super-AMOLED screens are&nbsp;<em>unfailingly</em>&nbsp;brilliant, so it&rsquo;s not at all surprising to see that the screen on the Galaxy Alpha follows suit. In fact, this particular screen has been made even better than its predecessors, with improved sunlight legibility and better colour accuracy.</p>
<p>On top of that, it&rsquo;s been made more efficient, so it uses less power to run, and thus doesn&rsquo;t drain the battery as quickly. That is a&nbsp;<em>definite</em>&nbsp;plus point in the Galaxy Alpha&rsquo;s favour!</p>
<p>At this point, though, we&rsquo;d like to address something that we&rsquo;ve seen mentioned a lot online, namely the fact that the resolution doesn&rsquo;t come in at 1080p, instead coming in at 720p, thus making the screen less sharp than it would be with those extra pixels.</p>
<p>Yes, that&nbsp;<em>is </em>true, and a 1080p screen&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;be sharper (and in all honesty, it&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;have been nice to see this with a 1080p screen), but at 4.7-inches, a 720p screen is absolutely fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally accurate, therefore, to say that the screen isn&rsquo;t as sharp as it could be, but it&rsquo;s demonstrably inaccurate to say that this makes the phone worse. It doesn&rsquo;t, and considering that pay-off is having a phone with a longer battery life, we&rsquo;d say that this compromise was totally worth it!</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The UK variant of Samsung Galaxy Alpha boasts an Exynos 5 Octa-core processor, giving you lightning fast performance, while simultaneously increasing your battery life...</p>
<p>The key to how the Galaxy Alpha can pull off that magic trick is the architecture of that octa-core processor: it&rsquo;s actually two&nbsp;<em>quad-core</em>&nbsp;processors, bolted together, an arrangement that Samsung calls &ldquo;<em>big.LITTLE</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What you have, then, is a quad-core processor clocked at 1.8GHz, combined with a second processor clocked to 1.3GHz, and the Galaxy Alpha hits its highest performance figures when all eight cores are running at once.</p>
<p>Once you stop doing something power-intensive, the phone switches from all eight cores, to run just the four low power cores, which draw less power and thus extend the battery life. It&rsquo;s a brilliant arrangement, and from what we&rsquo;ve seen, it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>As far as that top-end performance goes, Samsung Galaxy Alpha isn&rsquo;t quite as fast as its flagship sibling, Samsung Galaxy S5, but then, as we discussed in the <em>Design</em> section, being an uber-powerful superphone isn&rsquo;t the reason for the Galaxy Alpha&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s explicitly a &ldquo;lifestyle enhancement&rdquo; first and foremost, and the processor does it job perfectly, essentially just being there to make cool things happen whenever you touch the screen, without being intrusive or going, &ldquo;<em>Look at how big all these numbers are!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>With Samsung phones, you often find that flagships phones will share technology, and the big thing they&rsquo;ll usually share is the camera (Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 have almost identical cameras to each other, for example).</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the case with Samsung Galaxy Alpha, because it marks the first time we&rsquo;ve seen a 12MP camera in a Samsung phone since (as far as we can remember) the days of the M8800 Pixon!</p>
<p>In terms of actually&nbsp;<em>using</em>&nbsp;the camera, though, the interface&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;shared with its siblings (it appears to be lifted directly from Galaxy S5), which is fine by us, as it means that camera comes with all the extra features you&rsquo;d expect in those flagships, including Panorama and Dual Camera.</p>
<p>One feature we really do like is the ability to download extra camera modes from the Galaxy App store (there&rsquo;s Surround Shot, for example, which is similar to Google&rsquo;s Photosphere or Streetview, in that it lets you take spherical panorama shots).</p>
<p>In addition to cracking still images, Galaxy Alpha is also one of only a handful of smartphones that can record video at 2160p resolution (or 4K as it&rsquo;s sometimes called).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>One of the biggest new features of Samsung Galaxy Alpha is its fingerprint scanner, which is comes PayPal-certified, so you can use your fingerprint to securely pay for things online (you can also use it to verify your Samsung account and sign into websites, which is a nice touch).</p>
<p>The fingerprint scanner is also linked to the Private mode found in Samsung Galaxy Alpha, whereby you can store important data (be it photos, voice recordings, sensitive documents or whatever), behind a kind of firewall, which can only be accessed while the phone is in Private mode, using your fingerprint to access.</p>
<p>Another feature of the Galaxy Alpha that we want to highlight is the Easy Mode offered by Samsung&rsquo;s TouchWiz interface. What this does is cut out some the learning curve that comes with using an Android phone for the first time, limiting the number of widgets onscreen for example, and given the market this phone is aimed at (previous iPhone users, who are jumping across to perhaps their first ever Android phone), we can see this feature being an absolute godsend!</p>
<p>The best part, of course, is that it&rsquo;s entirely up to you whether you want to use Easy Mode, or jump straight into the standard Android experience. The fact that it even exists, and gives&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;the choice on how complicated you want your phone to be, is perhaps the best feature of them all!</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come out and say it right now: we&rsquo;re not sure that Samsung Galaxy Alpha is the iPhone-Killer that everyone pegs it as, but it has to be noted that it&rsquo;s through no fault of its own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply that iPhone users tend (although we know this is a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;generalisation) to be loyal to that brand, and with iPhone 6 now offering a 4.7-inch screen, there&rsquo;s less of an incentive to jump ship.</p>
<p>What Samsung Galaxy Alpha&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;is, though, is a mighty fine phone in its own right! It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s packed with great features, and the departure from Samsung&rsquo;s usual industrial design has turned out to be a roaring success.</p>
<p><strong>The slightly lower resolution screen may put off some users since those users, but if we put aside the iPhone-Killer moniker and view Galaxy Alpha for what it actually is (i.e. a more</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>pocketable </strong></em><strong>interpretation of a Samsung superphone), then we have to say that it&rsquo;s a success!</strong></p>
