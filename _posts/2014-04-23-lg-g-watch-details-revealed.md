<p><span class="postStandFirst">LG has created a new teaser site to show off some more details of their upcoming wearable device, the LG G Watch. Running on the Android Wear platform, the G Watch also features a water-resistant body (similar to smartphones like the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5), and an &lsquo;always-on&rsquo; screen. While it remains to be seen how this will affect battery life, it makes the G Watch eminently more useful in its traditional role as a watch!</span></p>
<p>After the unveiling of the wearable-focused Android Wear platform, more and more companies are showing off their ideas about what smartwatches should be like, from Samsung to Motorola, and now, it&rsquo;s the turn of LG.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7180/13977421331_6fdd559597.jpg" width="500" height="349" /></strong></p>
<p>According to ShinyShiny, the Korean manufacturer has taken the wraps of its own wearable device, the Android Wear-powered LG G Watch.</p>
<p>The information comes as part of a new product site that LG has unveiled, dedicated to the new LG G Watch, and it shows off a couple of new details that hadn&rsquo;t been made public until now. The first is that the G Watch will be water- and dust-resistant, and in the same way that we hope other smartphones follow the lead of the Sony Xperia Z2 and the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> by becoming water-resistant, we can&rsquo;t help but hope that future smartwatches follow the G Watch&rsquo;s lead as well.</p>
<p>The second feature is one that&rsquo;s potentially more contentious, namely that unlike Samsung&rsquo;s smartwatches (which need to be woken up by a swipe of the hand), the screen on the LG G Watch <em>never</em> switches off. On the one hand, that&rsquo;s good, as it allows you to quickly glance at the watch to check the time (since that is, let&rsquo;s be honest, part of the purpose of a watch). On the other, we do not yet know the specs of the G Watch, nor do we know the battery capacity.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s too early to say whether this always-on screen will shorten the LG G Watch&rsquo;s battery life, but we shall be keeping a close eye out for more information. Stay tuned for updates! </strong></p>
