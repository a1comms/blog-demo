<p><span class="postStandFirst">LG is reporting its highest quarterly profits since 2011, and we&rsquo;re not remotely surprised after the launch of its latest smartphone. Join us as we put LG G3 under the spotlight, to work out why this device is turning LG&rsquo;s fortunes around.</span></p>
<p>For one reason or another, LG hasn&rsquo;t yet enjoyed the same amount of adulation as the likes of Apple and Samsung, but by no means should it be underestimated.</p>
<p>The success and innovation of LG G2&nbsp;helped illustrate just how forward-thinking LG is, and in many ways, it paved the way for LG G3.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable smartphone, as you will soon find out, and since its release, people are quickly realising that LG is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6986 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14801792798_e527b52d84_o.jpg" alt="LG G3 Design" width="465" height="302" /></p>
<p>For a handset sporting such a large screen, there&rsquo;s something rather understated about LG G3. Its ergonomic design, measuring 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9mm, oozes pure, unadulterated class, through a minimalistic approach and a premium brushed metal appearance.</p>
<p>Its narrow bezels and curved rear create a very sleek look and feel, and the quality and robustness of the build instil a reassuring sense of confidence.</p>
<p>Mirroring the innovation of LG G2, the power button and volume rocker has been accommodated on the rear of the device, just beneath the camera sensor.</p>
<p>Deviating from the orthodox industry design, this arrangement does admittedly take some getting used to. But after a day or two, it all becomes second nature.</p>
<p>Besides, power buttons are obsolete. By double tapping the screen, you can wake your LG G3 up, or, if it&rsquo;s already alert, double tap to put it to sleep.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6987 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/lg-mobile-G3-feature-display.jpg" alt="LG G3 Display" width="880" height="496" /></p>
<p>Meet LG G3&rsquo;s pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance. As you may have discerned from all of the hype, LG G3 is the first smartphone with a Quad HD display to hit the UK. And it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>Quad HD yields four times the quality of standard HD, or in terms of its pixel count, that&rsquo;s a staggering resolution of 2560 x 1140.</p>
<p>For comparison, let&rsquo;s take a look at the number of pixels per inch (ppi) other flagship smartphones boast. iPhone 5s, with its Retina screen, offers a fair 326ppi. Samsung Galaxy S5, however, trumps that with an impressive 432ppi.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both seem rather paltry compared to LG G3, which knocks them both right out of the park with an astounding 534ppi&hellip; Some have argued that the human eye isn&rsquo;t actually capable of recognising detail that high. But either way, we&rsquo;re awestruck.</p>
<p>All you really need to know is that LG G3 is simply the foremost smartphone for watching videos and movies, not just for its life-like detail, but also for its expansive screen size.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6988 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14988399355_ce1616a424_o.jpg" alt="LG G3 Performance" width="465" height="302" /></p>
<p>Some say it&rsquo;s not so much the size of the ship, but rather the motion of the ocean. LG G3 certainly gloats an impressive size, but the all-important question is: will it leave you satisfied?</p>
<p>Owing to a powerful quad-core Snapdragon 801 2.46GHz processor, and a sizeable 2GB of RAM, we&rsquo;re inclined to say <em>yes</em> on this one.</p>
<p>Such is the potency and prowess of said components, users can enjoy a smooth and continuous performance when playing games or running multiple apps simultaneously.</p>
<p>That chipset, coupled with Android 4.4 (KitKat) and a slick, minimalistic graphic user interface, delivers one of the finest, most seamless and enjoyable experiences on a smartphone.</p>
<p>And LG has designed its function features with different colours, so you&rsquo;re able to spot what you need in the blink of an eye.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6989 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14801852527_e8df022ebe_z.jpg" alt="LG G3 Camera" width="640" height="332" /></p>
<p>Smartphones like Nokia Lumia 930&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lumia 1020, with their respective 20MP and 41MP cameras, cast an unnerving shadow in the industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly understandable to assume that a lower pixel count might correspond to a lower quality of photography, especially when you consider the comparably meagre 13-megapixels that the camera on LG G3 is equipped with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be hoodwinked by this common misconception; the camera on LG G3 is by no means something to be overlooked.</p>
<p>It features a dual-tone flash (as found on flagship handsets like iPhone 5s and&nbsp;HTC One M8) and an industry first laser autofocus. Dual-tone flashes and laser beams all sound a bit James Bond; what do they do?</p>
<p>Well, a dual-tone flash consists of two LEDs, one white and one amber, which flash simultaneously to create a more natural look.</p>
<p>So when you take photos in dark environments, you won&rsquo;t look as though you&rsquo;re cursed with a sickly pallor, which can often result from a single white flash.</p>
<p>Secondly, what the pioneering laser focus allows LG G3 to do is to focus on a subject &lsquo;quicker than the blink of an eye&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It does so by emitting infrared light, much like laser beam range meters, which then refract from a surface and bounce back, allowing LG G3 to ascertain the exact range between itself and whatever it is you&rsquo;re trying to take a photo of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple, but smart, piece of technology that bears tremendous results.</p>
<p>To spice your photography up, LG G3 comes furnished with some brilliant software features, like Auto focus, Magic focus (for close ups/macro), Panorama mode (when you want to capture your entire environment) and Dual mode (which takes a photo with the front and rear camera simultaneously).</p>
<p>Of course, the video camera boasts some neat features, too. It shoots in ultra-high 4K resolution and you can even play back your life-like footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>The 2.1MP front-facing camera has been artfully constructed with a large image sensor, which allows copious amounts of light to flood into your shot, even in low-light situations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also gesture controlled, which we think is pretty cool. If you open the camera application, lift your hand so it's&nbsp;within shot, make a fist, and an automated 3-second countdown will initiate before taking a picture. Voil&agrave;! You have the perfect selfie.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6990 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/14801852407_9551786cb1_o.jpg" alt="LG G3 features" width="465" height="302" /></p>
<p>Smart Notice is a pretty neat feature. It suggests things that you may need, or want to do, before you even ask. Users receive prompts asking things like whether you want to delete an app that hasn&rsquo;t been used for a while, or reminders to call someone back.</p>
<p>LG G3 debuts LG&rsquo;s Knock Code, which the tech company describes as &lsquo;the most secure, simple and fun way to unlock your phone&rsquo;.&nbsp;Instead of the conventional four-digit code, users can unlock their LG G3 by knocking in a seemingly arbitrary pattern, from over 80,000 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Health apps seem to be en vogue at the minute, and LG hasn&rsquo;t missed the trend, as illustrated by the pre-installed LG Health app.</p>
<p>Users are required to enter their age, height and weight for the app to work out your Body Mass Index (BMI). Based on the results, the LG Health app then recommends how many steps a day you need to be completing in order to achieve the optimum BMI.</p>
<p>Like many of the top smartphones, LG G3 features 4G LTE connectivity for blazing-fast Internet speeds, Near Field Communication (NFC) for wireless device pairing, Bluetooth 4.0 and a microSD card slot to expand your internal storage.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, LG G3 delivers exquisite visibility, a stunning lightweight design and an extremely advanced camera. To date, it really is one of the greatest devices we&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of reviewing.</p>
<p><strong>LG G3 is spearheading an elite group of smartphones, including the likes of Samsung Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s, and you&rsquo;d be imprudent not to seriously consider it as your next smartphone.&nbsp;</strong></p>
