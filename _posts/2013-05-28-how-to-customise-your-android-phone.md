<p><span class="postStandFirst">It's easy to customise your Android handset to make it a truly personal experience. Here are our tips for making your Android device your own.</span></p>
<p>Android is one of the most widely used operating system in the world, spanning a multitude of smartphones and tablets. Manufacturers love the OS because of its adaptable nature and open source software, allowing them to bend and shape it to suit their brand image.</p>
<p>Consumers love it for exactly the same reason; customisation options run throughout Android devices letting users turn their smartphone into a truly unique personal possession.</p>
<p>In fact, there are so many customisation options that it&rsquo;s easy to miss some of them. Take a look at these tips for making your Android device your own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/8865683591_374c6c1815.jpg" alt="" width="157" height="312" /></p>
<h2>Lock screen</h2>
<p>The first thing that you see when you turn on your Android device is the lock screen &ndash; this is true of every Android phone, from the Samsung Galaxy range to the HTC models.</p>
<p>All manufacturers will have slightly different ways of customising the lock screen on their device but the basic principles are the same. On most Android devices you&rsquo;ll find the customisation options in the Lock Screen section of the Settings menu. This will let you change what you see on the lock screen, with everything from missed calls to the time and date easily changeable.</p>
<p>You can also change the image that you see on the lock screen. The default setting for this is usually the same image that you have for your wallpaper but this can be changed to the stock images preloaded on your phone or one of your own images.</p>

<p>Changing the wallpaper on your android phone is one of the easier things to change on an Android and you have plenty of options when it comes to what you want. You can either choose one of the preloaded wallpapers that the manufacturer has put on the phone or choose one of your own images.</p>
<p>To choose a preloaded image, go to the display section in the Settings menu and click on Wallpaper which will give you the manufacturer&rsquo;s options.</p>
<p>If you are choosing one of your own photos, simply click on Options when viewing the photo and select Set As... Wallpaper.</p>
<p>If you want something a little different, the Google Play app store has a range of moving &lsquo;live&rsquo; wallpapers that include animations.</p>
<h2>Android Apps &amp; Google Play</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the main things we use our smartphones for these days, even more than making phone calls, is downloading and using apps. There are hundreds of useful apps out there which you can download from Google Play. With so many around it can make our phones fairly cluttered. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to manage these apps and keep yoursmartphone tidy.<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5326/8866292320_cf1f57d446_m.jpg" alt="" width="121" height="240" /></p>
<p>To move your apps around or change their order, simply press and hold down the app you want to move until you have &lsquo;picked it up&rsquo;. You can then move it to a different position.</p>
<p>Most Android devices, including those in the Sony Xperia range, give you the option of change the order of all your apps at once. To do this, simply select the options menu (this will be in different place on different phones) when you&rsquo;re on the app screen and choose how you want your apps to be ordered.</p>
<p>If the number of apps you have is starting to really clutter your phone, it&rsquo;s a good idea to bunch them together into files to make them easier to find. To do this, &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; an app in the same way as mentioned earlier and drag and drop it on top of another app. This will create a file with both apps in, which you can rename and add other apps to</p>
<h2>Android Ringtones</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/8866292310_73f0078066_n.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="320" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2893/8865683601_f9300f419d_n.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="320" /></p>
<p>Ringtones have been one of the primary customisation options on mobile phones ever since the days of the Nokia 3310 and it&rsquo;s just as easy to change yours now as it was then.</p>
<p>To change yours, go to the Sounds section in your Settings menu and select the ringtone options. You can then choose from the default option or one of your own tracks.</p>
<p>Some Android devices let you edit songs so your ringtone starts with the chorus of a song, for example. Check the edit options in the Settings menu for this or download an editing app from the Google Play store.</p>
