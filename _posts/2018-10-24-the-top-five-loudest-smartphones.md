<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Pump, pump, pump it up. These are loudest mobile phones money can buy.</span></p>
<p>For the deep-sleepers who need extra volume that rouses. And the party-starters who want to raise the roof. We&rsquo;ve put together a compilation of the top five loudest smartphones that silence the competition.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, HTC was known for having the best and loudest smartphone speakers. While an HTC did not make the list this time, you&rsquo;ll see that newer brands are now making more noise. Which brands exactly? You might be surprised.</p>
<p>But before we delve into the results, it&rsquo;s important to establish something. Smartphone loudness is rated in decibels (dB), and each increase of 10 dB <em>doubles</em> the loudness.</p>
<p>So 20 dB is twice as loud as 10 dB, 30 dB is four times as loud as 10 dB, and 80 dB is 128 times lounder than 10 dB. In other words, there&rsquo;s a bigger difference than you might think between 50 dB and, say, 60 dB.</p>
<p>Put into real-world context, a lawn mower produces between 85-90 dB, a car horn around 110 dB, and a sperm whale 236 dB. Human ear drums burst at 160 dB, so maybe strike <em>swimming with whales</em> from your bucket list&hellip;</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&rsquo;s Buymobiles&rsquo; top five loudest smartphones.</p>
<h2>5) Samsung Galaxy A8 - 81.6 dB</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) has an impressive spec along with its pretty powerful speaker. At 81.6 dB, its nothing to be sniffed at, beating its other <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy</a> brothers and sisters to this top five loudest smartphones list. A single speaker positioned on the side of the handset releases Ultra High Quality Audio Playback for all to hear. Did we mention, a headphone jack comes as standard too. Enjoy its impressive sound along with a striking screen, cameras and design to boot.</p>

<h2>3) Huawei P20 Lite - 84.9 dB</h2>
