<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6931 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/force-touch.png" alt="Force Touch coming to iPhone 6s" width="704" height="394" /></p>
<p><span class="postStandFirst">Of all the rumours surrounding the next incarnation of Apple&rsquo;s super-popular iPhone, perhaps the most intriguing is that it will include something called &lsquo;Force Touch&rsquo;. That rumour is being touted again, and this time, we might have an idea of how it will be implemented.</span></p>
<p>According to 9to5Mac, who are writing that iOS 9 will feature support across the board for Force Touch, the new feature will be used to enhance some of the core functionality of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.</p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> Force Touch?</p>
<p>Put simply, it amounts to a pressure-sensitive screen, much as you will find on the Apple Watch and newer Macbooks; in short, you can interact with the screen in two ways, by <em>touching</em> it as you would on the iPhone 6, and by <em>pressing</em> it.</p>
<p>The Force Touch feature will allow the iPhone 6s to tell how hard you&rsquo;re pressing the screen (in order to differentiate between the two), and can then perform different actions, depending on whether you <em>touched</em> or <em>pressed</em> the display.</p>
<p>As for how this will be integrated into the iPhone 6s, there are a number of key ways it will allegedly be used; in Maps, a press will allow you to drop a pin on the map, in media players it will allow for pressure-sensitive scrolling, and a press in the Calendar app will add a new event.</p>
<p><strong>While this is still a rumour, it is one of the more consistent ones we&rsquo;ve been hearing, so we&rsquo;d expect to hear about the implementation of Force Touch into the iPhone 6s once the phone is announced. Stay tuned for more news. </strong></p>
