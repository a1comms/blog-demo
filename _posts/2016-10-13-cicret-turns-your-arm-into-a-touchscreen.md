<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is Cicret the future of smart technology? Watch the video below.</span></p>
<p>Touchscreen capabilities are nothing new. Modern smartphones have featured the technology for years. The question is, are there exciting and creative ways we can reengineer them?</p>
<p>Well, imagine having your very own touchscreen on your arm. Rather than laboriously dragging your smartphone out of your pocket, and prodding away like some sort of caveman, you could simply tap your forearm to command a touchscreen to appear, seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It might sound totally far-fetched, like one of Tony Stark's snazzy hologram inventions, but this type of crazy tech could be readily available much sooner than you think.</p>

<p>The good people at Cicret have just released a prototype bracelet that does precisely this, projecting a touchscreen directly onto your skin. The idea is that you sync the bracelet with your mobile, and it mirrors the screen, displaying it on your arm. Neat, huh?</p>
<p>The Cicret bracelet will boast a whole range of functions, including water-resistance, a removable battery, and, of course, compatibility with the two key operating systems: iPhone and Android. Once it&rsquo;s finally available, this futuristic gadget will set you back $300 (about &pound;240).</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not the first time that we&rsquo;ve heard about this radical piece of tech. Gadget-lovers may remember that a video of the Cicret bracelets circulating back in 2014. At the time, these wearables were a mere concept; the video was a promotion to get some recognition and funding. It looks like it worked.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2016 and the team has built a working prototype. More investment is still needed, though, to get the product to market, and so they&rsquo;ve turned to crowdfunding. By choosing to donate to the project while it&rsquo;s still in its initial stage, you can get a discount on the wearable. So, rather than paying the full price for the Cicret bracelet, it's yours for a reduced price of&nbsp;$250 (&pound;200).</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s justifiably been a lot of hype around the bracelet, it&rsquo;s still unclear whether it&rsquo;s a viable piece of tech. Experts have raised concerns about the fact that the bracelet uses a laser to project the screen onto your skin. Will this cause any&nbsp;health-related issues? We simply don't know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the original promo video was made using CGI, so no one knows exactly how functional the Cicret bracelet is and whether it&rsquo;s worth the money. That is sure to put doubts in more than a few people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>If all goes to plan, though, the production of Cicret bracelets will start this December, with the first orders going out in early 2017. Whether the bracelets will be worth the cash is still very much up for debate, but they certainly look like a winning idea. Watch this space.</p>
