<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Google Pixel set to take on the power of Apple. Watch the event below.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had HUGE launches from Samsung, Motorola and Apple this year, but for hard-core Android fans, the biggest launch of 2016 is today.</p>
<p>What is usually the annual unveiling of Google&rsquo;s Nexus line of smart devices, looks set to become something else entirely&hellip;</p>
<p>Gone is the Nexus moniker. From its ashes rises a new brand altogether. They call it Pixel.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_11729" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-11729" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Pixels-Movie.gif" alt="pixels-movie" width="600" height="249" /> Not to be confused with Pixels, the movie.[/caption]</p>
<p>The rumours tell us that Pixel is a high-end offering, designed to deliver the ultimate Android experience that&rsquo;s exceptional enough to go toe-to-toe with Apple&rsquo;s mighty <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-black">iPhone 7</a> series.</p>
<p>Sounds tantalising, right? Well there apparently two Pixel smartphones coming, which we&rsquo;re just about to get on to, in addition to a few other updates from Google that are equally as exciting.</p>
<h2>The Power of the Pixel</h2>
<p>As you know, Google cherry-picks a manufacturer to assemble its smartphones; this year, it looks as though HTC is the chosen one. With HTC&rsquo;s design expertise, you can expect a beautifully crafted device. Or, in this case, <em>devices</em>.</p>
<p>The industry is speculating that there are two new Google phones on their way: Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11730" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/pixel-leak-cpw-2.jpg" alt="pixel-leak-cpw-2" width="600" height="350" /></p>
<p>Of course, the XL variant will be the larger of the two, rumoured to sport a 5.5-inch beast of a display and a Quad HD resolution to match. The smaller Pixel is said to come in at 5-inches, equipped with a crisp Full HD display.</p>
<p>Both, we&rsquo;ve heard, will pack a Snapdragon 821 processor, a generous 4GB RAM, advanced 12.3-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera. That&rsquo;s in addition to fingerprint scanners and technology that&rsquo;s similar to 3D Touch on iPhone.</p>
<p>According to the leaks, both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be made from a blend of aluminium and glass, and could be available in silver, black and electric blue.</p>

<h2>A Welcomed Update to Chromecast</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s plugin TV accessory has sold by the buckets, giving users the ability to &lsquo;cast&rsquo; content from their smart device to their television. Chromecast Ultra is the speculated update, bringing with it 4K streaming for Ultra High Definition viewing. Now that your favourite TV apps, like Netflix, are beginning to stream in 4K, the timing couldn&rsquo;t be better, or more welcomed.</p>
<h2>Forget Smartphones. We&rsquo;re Talking Smart Homes.</h2>
<p>Google Home is a voice controlled smart home hub, rivalling Amazon&rsquo;s recently released Echo. It answers your questions, controls other Google products like Nest and Chromecast, and will even update you on need-to-know info like traffic and weather before you head out. This one, we're&nbsp;really looking forward to. Let&rsquo;s hope Google Home delivers on its potential.</p>
<h2>A Nibble of the New Nougat</h2>
<p>Sadly, there won&rsquo;t be an update on Android Wear 2.0, which looks to have been pushed back until early 2017. Though we will get a good look at Android 7.1, the latest version of Nougat that should launch with Google's new Pixel smartphones. We expect that a list of fixes and minor improvements, as well as some insight into its availability.</p>
<h2>How to Stream Google&rsquo;s Event</h2>
<p>So that&rsquo;s most of what you need to know in preparation for Google&rsquo;s big event. We&rsquo;re of course waiting with baited breath for the show to start, if you are too, then you can stream it below via Google&rsquo;s official YouTube page.</p>
