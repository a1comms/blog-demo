<p><span class="postStandFirst">With Android growing at an astonishing rate, Google keeps on producing top-notch devices to show the operating system off in its full glory!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5535 aligncenter" alt="Nexus 4" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/NExus-4-1024x691.jpg" width="960" height="647" /></p>
<p>Having seen several incarnations in the Nexus product range, the latest devices from Google are nothing short of brilliant, bridging advanced technology and functionality with price.</p>
<p>The original Nexus device hit the market back in January 2010. Dubbed the Nexus One, this handset was the first 'pure-bred' Android phone, running stock Android 2.1 upon release, and was manufactured by HTC.</p>
<p>Following hot-on-the-heels of the Nexus One was a new device named the Nexus S. This time Samsung took the manufacturing reigns from HTC and created a device loosely based on the then popular Galaxy S. The Nexus S hit the market in December 2010 and was the first handset to feature Android 2.3 (or Gingerbread as it was also known). this was the most evolutionary version of Android to-date and included software to support the new NFC hardware.</p>
<p>The next Google phone again came from Samsung. This time called the Galaxy Nexus and released in November 2011. The Galaxy Nexus was the first phone to feature an HD display and once again contained NFC technology which. Though the latest version of Android was now able to fully share files through the built-in Android Beam application. The handset shipped with Android 4.0, dubbed Ice Cream Sandwich, and was a real head-turner as it brought many new functions to the OS, including the aforementioned Android Beam, panoramic photo capabilities and the ability to create folders for your apps.</p>
<p>In July 2012, Google took a slight change in direction from phones when they realised the Nexus 7, a 7 inch tablet that went on to become a market leader. It featured a quad-core processor, HD display and even NFC technology. The first Google tablet also shipped with Android's latest OS variant, 4.1 or Jelly Bean. This new version of Android brought forward more features than previous forms, the biggest being Project Butter which allowed the supported devices to run the OS at 60fps, simply meaning that it ran smoothly and was lag-free.</p>
<p>Google's Nexus range however was about to go big. The announcement in late October 2012 saw the search engine giant announce three new devices in the form of the LG-made&nbsp;Nexus 4, a smartphone with amazing specifications and software; a new version of the Asus Nexus 7 tablet that saw the inclusion of 3G; andh a first for Google in the form of a Full HD 10 inch tablet, named the Samsung Nexus 10. &nbsp;Each device showcased Android 4.2 which included multi-user accounts, customisable lock screens, Google Now and Photosphere.</p>
<p><strong>The year 2013 sees a new version of the Android OS planned called 5.0, or Key Lime Pie, and it promises to be a winner. One thing is certain... The Google-based OS offers one of the best smartphone experiences possible!</strong></p>
