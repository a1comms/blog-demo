<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is it 6<sup>th </sup>or 7<sup>th</sup> heaven for Samsung?</span></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note rumour mill is in full motion. And the main questions circulating are what the next Note&rsquo;s going to be called, and whether it&rsquo;ll be curved. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what we (think we) know&hellip;</p>
<p>The industry believes that Samsung will name the next iteration in its giant flagship series, as the Galaxy Note 7, with the idea that 2015&rsquo;s Galaxy S6 edge Plus was the fill-in device. Numerically speaking that is.</p>
<p>According to a leaked invite image, the Galaxy Note 7 is expected to be unveiled in New York City on 2<sup>nd</sup> August, most likely as part of an extravagant presentation that the Korean tech company is becoming known for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11082" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/The-Next-Galaxy.jpg" alt="The Next Galaxy" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>So we think know the name, but what do we know about the device? Some believe that the Note 7 is shaping up to be a monster to rival Godzilla.</p>
<p>Samsung has a knack for creating true powerhouse phablets and the next iteration is thought to fit the same ilk, so much so, that it&rsquo;s speculated that Samsung&rsquo;s preparing new, bespoke processors and technology for it.</p>
<p>Sticking with current flagship trends, the Note 7 is expected to sport a massive 5.8-inch Super AMOLED QHD display, which will undoubtedly offer an amazing viewing experience.</p>
<p>Under the hood it&rsquo;s thought that the device will be one of the first to run the brand new Snapdragon 823 processor with a ridiculous 6GB of RAM. This coupling will allow the Note 7 to be a true multi-tasking machine.</p>
<p>The rear of the handset is said to feature the same camera unit as the Galaxy S7 &ndash; a 12MP unit with an aperture of f/1.7, complete with ultracell technology.</p>
<p>What should make the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 really stand out from previous Notes is a dual curved display, similar to that of the Galaxy S7 edge. This might allow users to make use of the S Pen in more creative ways.</p>
<p>Lastly, and certainly by no means any less significant, the rumours are suggesting Galaxy Note 7 will be equipped with a huge 4000mAh battery, feature IP68 certification (water and dustproof) and also house an iris scanner for quick device access.</p>
<p><strong>Exciting speculation if we&rsquo;ve ever heard it&hellip; If just a fraction of these specs turn out to be true, those of us looking for a new phablet could be in for a real treat.</strong></p>
