<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The perfect gadget for every calorie counter out there.</span></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re watching what you eat, your go-to plan of action may be to download a calorie counting app, such as MyFitnessPal. Yes, with just the tap of a button, you can keep track of how much you&rsquo;re eating on a daily basis.</p>
<p>While most of us are still trying to get to grips with that level of tech, there&rsquo;s a new dieting gadget in town&hellip;</p>
<p>Say hello to the <a href="http://gccatapult.panasonic.com/en/calorieco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CaloRieco</a> &mdash;&nbsp;the table top gadget that can measure how many calories you have on your plate in just 10 seconds. Nice. The tech comes from the Japanese electronics company Panasonic and, let&rsquo;s be honest, it looks pretty amazing.</p>

<p>So, how on earth does it all work? Well, you dish up your food, place it inside the gadget, and then press a button. Seconds later, you get a breakdown of not only how many calories are in the dish, but also the amount of carbs, fat, and protein too.</p>
<p>That means that working out how much you&rsquo;re consuming has literally never been easier.</p>
<p>CaloRieco apparently uses a &lsquo;near infrared ray&rsquo; to do all the maths, and connects to the cloud using WiFi. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll need to download a comparison app to get a full breakdown of your nutrition profile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a solution which can measure calories and three major nutrients in meals before you eat. It was developed to free the hands of diabetic patients and their family who manage diets every single day, as well as the hands of people who are on a diet,&rdquo; the Panasonic team explain on the gadget&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calculating calories by hand used to take time and effort, but by a unique analyzing method using near infrared ray, it can measure calories in a short time with a high precision which even the experts acknowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CaloRieco was revealed as part of the SXSW event back in May and has been fully exhibited at the CEATEC over in Tokyo last week. Sadly, right now, we have no idea how much the device will cost or even when it will be available. So, if you want to get your hands on this modern-day wizardry, you&rsquo;ll have to wait and see!</p>
