<p>Data issues &ndash; we all have them! Whether you&rsquo;re trying to listen to a podcast or use Google Maps to find your way around, the last thing you need is to find yourself running low.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of using your entire data allowance every single month, we might just have the answer. Here&rsquo;s one way you can get the latest flagship and bag extra data too.</p>
<h2>What Flagship Phone Can You Get?</h2>
<p>Are you ready to get more data for your money? We hear you! The latest EE promotion boasts a whole load of stellar deals that will give you more data for your pennies. For now, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the flagships and what you can expect when you get the deal!</p>
<h5>iPhone Xs</h5>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it &ndash;&nbsp;the latest iPhones are things of pure beauty. The iPhone Xs packs a 5.8-inch Super Retina display, the space-aged sounding A12 Bionic chip, a dual-camera system, and more. Pair all of the above with a cool, almost bezeless look and you&rsquo;ve got a real recipe for success.</p>
<p>As part of the EE promotion, you can bag yourself 50GB data (rather than the usual 25GB). That&rsquo;s double data action! Plus, when you buy the device through Buymobiles a six-month subscription to Apple Music and a three-month one to BT Sport for free.</p>

<h5>iPhone Xs Max</h5>
<p>Of course, if you like your handsets a little larger, you might want to consider the Plus model. Sporting all that the iPhone Xs has along with a larger frame and a 6.5-inch Super Retina display, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this iPhone.</p>
<p>When you get an EE contract through us, you can get yourself 50GB instead of the standard 25GB. You also get the Apple Music and BT Sport bonuses too! Yes, please!</p>

<h5>iPhone 8</h5>
<p>As stylish as it is elegant, the iPhone 8 is a wonderful looking device. Offering wireless charging, a great 12-megapixel camera, and loads of awesome features to boot, the device is an affordable yet high-end flagship phone.</p>
<p>Forget double data&hellip; How would you like <em>triple</em> data? One of the best iPhone 8 EE deals offers you a whopping 45GB of data rather than the standard 15GB. You also get &pound;30 cashback (score!), three months of BT Sport, and a free six-month Apple Music subscription.</p>

<h5>iPhone 8 Plus</h5>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re the kind of person who is all about a larger screen, picking the iPhone 8 Plus could be the way to go. The Apple device is a little larger than the standard offering and still packs a whole load of killer features. You get wireless charging, a pro 12-megapixel camera, and a top-of-the range 5.5-inch Full HD display.</p>
<p>With the EE deal, you can get yourself 50GB of data, rather than 25GB. You also get six months of Apple Music, three months of BT Sports, high data speeds, and more.</p>

<h5>Samsung Galaxy S9</h5>
<p>With a 5.8-inch widescreen Quad HD Infinity Display, a chic minimal design, and a seriously gasp-worthy camera, it&rsquo;s clear to see why so many people fall head over heels in love with the Samsung Galaxy S9. It even has fun extras such as the ability to turn yourself emoji using the AR feature. What more could you want?</p>
<p>Should you get the device through us with EE, you can expect a bargain deal. Rather than getting 25GB of data, you get 50GB of data. You can also get a free Apple Music subscription for six months and BT Sport for three months.</p>

<p>The usual offering gives you 15GB of data but you can boost that to 30GB with the latest deal. There&rsquo;s also the same Apple Music and BT Sport freebies as you get with the standard S9 deal.</p>
