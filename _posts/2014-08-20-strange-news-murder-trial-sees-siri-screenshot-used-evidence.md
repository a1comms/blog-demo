<p><span class="postStandFirst">In one of the most unexpected pieces of news we&rsquo;ve seen in a long time, a screenshot of Apple&rsquo;s Siri has appeared in the prosecution&rsquo;s evidence in a USA murder trial. While it has now been discounted as evidence, smartphone evidence is a key feature in modern criminal trials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4944" alt="Siri" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/ycnptgn02hc5l9cwb1tn.jpg" width="445" height="331" /></p>
<p>In the world of mobile phones, we quite often see news that is a little bit unexpected, or a little bit strange. One of the strangest pieces of news, though, has happened recently, when a screenshot of Apple&rsquo;s Siri was used in a murder trial in the USA.</p>
<p>According to Mashable, the screenshot was entered as evidence in the trial of Pedro Bravo, although it has since been ruled as not accurate evidence, and is no longer viewed as a screenshot made by the defendant himself.</p>
<p>Bravo is accused of murdering his friend Christian Aguilar in 2012, and the prosecution briefly alluded to the idea that the Siri screenshot taken from his phone was evidence that he was guilty. The screenshot in question is of Siri&rsquo;s infamous response to being told the phone&rsquo;s user needed to hide a body, with its response being &ldquo;<i>What kind of place are you looking for?</i>&rdquo; followed by four joking suggestions: &ldquo;<i>Swamps. Reservoirs. Metal Foundries. Dumps.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Defence counsellors noted, however, that the network logo on the screenshot does not match the network that the defendant used (i.e. American network AT&amp;T, when the defendant used Verizon), and also that the defendant used an iPhone 4.</p>
<p>Siri, while available from the iPhone 4s up to the current iPhone 5s, was <i>not</i> available on the iPhone 4.</p>
<p><strong>However, the prosecution has also entered other location-based evidence which they say conflicts with Bravo&rsquo;s alibi, so it is clear that we cannot (and indeed <i>should not</i>) predict the outcome of the trial, which is expected to conclude next week.</strong></p>
