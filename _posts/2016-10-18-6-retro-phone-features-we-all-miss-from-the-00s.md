<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Will any mobile game ever outclass Snake?</span></p>
<p>These days, smartphones can do just about everything we could possibly ever need. Short of cooking our breakfast and doing the school run, they&rsquo;re pretty much the all-in-one gadget of the future we could only have dreamt about as teenagers.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s always a place for a heart-warming serving of nostalgia, and while modern-day phones are pretty much the most important item many of us own, we can&rsquo;t help but miss some retro features from the good old days. Here are six classics that we want back in our lives...</p>
<h2>1. Mixing Ringtones Like a World-Famous DJ</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11851" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Mixing-Ringtones-Like-a-World-Famous-DJ.jpg" alt="mixing-ringtones-like-a-world-famous-dj" width="600" height="336" /></p>
<p>If you were lucky enough to be walking around with a Nokia back in the day (i.e. the early 2000s), you will no doubt remember mixing your own ringtones, feeling like the next Pete Tong waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>There were cheat sheets to walk you through the process, but the fun was creating your own ringtones by, let&rsquo;s face it, mashing the keypad until the result resembled something like a tune. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it would be oh-so-worth it for the street cred among your friends at school.</p>
<h2>2. Answering Phone Calls Like a&nbsp;Bad Mofo</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11850" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Answering-Phone-Calls-Like-a-Secret-Agent.gif" alt="answering-phone-calls-like-a-secret-agent" width="600" height="321" /></p>
<p>Flip phones turned even the geekiest of us into the smoothest kid in school. There was just something innately badass&nbsp;about answering the phone with a flip.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d know if any of your mates had a flip phone, like the Motorola RAZR, because, understandably, they wouldn&rsquo;t stop making a song and dance about it, constantly flipping it open and answering it in extravagant ways.</p>
<h2>3. TxtN M8s lik eng wz ur 2<sup>nd</sup> lgnwij</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11849" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/texting-language.jpg" alt="texting-language" width="600" height="480" /></p>
<p>We were all pros when it came to texting in shorthand on mobile phones, often without looking, using the standard T9 input.</p>
<p>Sure, the <em>first </em>time you came face-to-face with T9, it was a pain getting your head around, having to press the '6' button three times before you could muster up an 'o'. But you soon got the hang of it.</p>
<p>Especially with the creation of a new, shorthand version of the English language, streamlining the process entirely. Even if it meant sacrificing grammar and spelling.</p>
<p>Some radical people have argued that this system of texting was quicker than a QWERTY keyboard - once mastered. The jury&rsquo;s still out on that one.</p>
<h2>4. Batteries That Outlasted the Gods</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11848" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Batteries-That-Outlasted-the-Gods.jpg" alt="batteries-that-outlasted-the-gods" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>These days, the majority of us <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/this-is-how-much-it-costs-you-to-charge-your-phone-for-a-year">recharge our phones</a> every night. Some heavy smartphone users are probably used to a charge at some point during the day too!</p>
<p>Back in the 00s, though, things were a little different. You could charge your phone on Monday and <em>still </em>have half your battery life left come the following Sunday evening. Ah, they were simpler times.</p>
<h2>5. Sliding Out of Stressful Moods</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11847" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/nokia7110.jpg" alt="nokia7110" width="600" height="342" /></p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have a flip phone back in the day, you probably at least owned a slider phone at some point. I was lucky enough to get my grubby little hands on a Nokia 7110 as a teen, and I don&rsquo;t know where I would&rsquo;ve been without it.</p>
<p>Anyone who boasted one of these bad boys will no doubt remember that they offered the ultimate cure for stress and fidgeting hands. Whenever you were feeling tense or bored, you could seek solace in sliding your phone back and forth&hellip; back and forth.</p>
<h2>6.&nbsp;The Only Game That Ever Mattered</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11846" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Snake-GIF.gif" alt="snake-gif" width="600" height="593" /></p>
<p>Finally (and I really have saved the best until last), the feature that we <em>all</em> miss about our phones from days of yore, is, of course the old-school games.</p>
<p>Snake was beyond question the king of the lot&hellip; Until, of course, Snake II came out. The only game that has since bested it. We really don&rsquo;t need to remind you how insanely addictive it was&hellip; Getting a new high score became every teenager&rsquo;s ultimate life goal back in the 2000s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to think that, despite all the dazzling new gaming apps that come out each year, we&rsquo;ve never had one that surpassed the simplicity and brilliance of this Snake.</p>
