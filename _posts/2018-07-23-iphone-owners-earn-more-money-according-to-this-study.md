<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Nearly 70% of iPhone users have high incomes.</span></p>
<p>The smartphone world is rife with competition. Market leaders &ndash; including <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a>, and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei </a>&ndash; are in a fierce battle to take the number one spot.</p>
<p>Each year, these brands bring out fancier, more impressive incarnations of the latest smartphone. Luckily for consumer, that means that technology is skyrocketing forward.</p>
<p>With so much choice out there, it can be hard to know which way to go. When you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade your phone and get a new one, you might spend your time researching what&rsquo;s out there and looking for a device with all the latest features. It&rsquo;s fair to say that, while specs may vary, there&rsquo;s very little between some of the leading flagships.</p>

<p>However, according to a new piece of research, the type of phone that you choose may indicate how much you earn. The results show a link between brand loyalty and a person&rsquo;s specific income bracket. <em>Of course, this is by no means true for all mobile users, but the latest statistics are quite interesting.</em></p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24771#fromrss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> from The National Bureau of Economic Research found that the type of phone a person has is a good indicator of their overall earnings. The research found that nearly 70% of people who owned an iPhone fell into the higher earner bracket. What&rsquo;s more, the study&rsquo;s authors claim that &lsquo;no individual brand is as predictive of being high income as owning an Apple iPhone.&rsquo;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mW6hFttt_KE" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the research didn&rsquo;t only look at smartphones. It also found that owning other Apple branded products &ndash; such as a Mac, MacBook, or iPad &ndash;&nbsp;were also indicators of a high earner. Having one of the above could be a sign that your income is larger than the average one. The reason behind this could be that these products are typically more expensive than the alternatives on the market.</p>
<p>Despite the higher price tag usually attached to Apple products, that trend could be about to change. Rumour has it that the brand will be launching a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/iphone-9-rumours-and-release-date-heres-what-weve-heard-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more affordable version of the latest iPhone</a> this September.</p>
<p>While, of course, there&rsquo;s no official word from the brand at the moment, many have speculated that the phone may have similar specs to the latest device but come at a cheaper price point. Currently, the iPhone X costs &pound;999 SIM free, and so a more affordable option would be a welcome addition to the current line-up.</p>
