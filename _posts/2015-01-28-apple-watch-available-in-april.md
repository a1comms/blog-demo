<p><span class="postStandFirst">After months of speculation, Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed when the Apple Watch will be going on sale: we can expect to see it arrive in April, with prices expected to start around &pound;300.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5149" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-10-at-16.16.27-1024x566.png" alt="Apple Watch Crown" width="960" height="530" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been waiting for more news about when the Apple Watch, the Cupertino giant&rsquo;s entry into the burgeoning world of smartwatches, would go on sale. Now, after an earnings call by Apple, we finally have an idea of when we&rsquo;ll be able to get our hands on one.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2015/01/apple-watch-will-arrive-april-according-tim-cook.html">ShinyShiny</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that the Apple Watch will be available in April.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t quite tie up with previous rumours, however, which stated that the Apple Watch would be launching in March, but as the source link points out, Cook stated that the smartwatch will be <em>shipping</em> in April; thus it is entirely possible that the device <em>could</em> be launching in March, ready for a full launch the following month.</p>
<p>As was confirmed by Apple last year, we will be seeing <em>three</em> versions of the Apple Watch, each designed to cater to specific markets. The entry-level model, simply called the Apple Watch, is expected to retail for around &pound;300. The next model up from that, the Apple Watch Sport, will be offered with an anodised aluminium body, while the top-end model, the Apple Watch Edition, will include an 18-carat gold body and a sapphire crystal screen.</p>

<p>Of course, you will need a recent iPhone with which to use the Apple Watch; the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will both be supported, as will the previous iPhone 5s and 5c, although it seems likely that earlier models will <em>not</em> be supported.</p>
<p>So, now might be the perfect time to get that new iPhone that you&rsquo;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p><strong>We will have more on this story as it develops, so stay tuned for the latest news!</strong></p>
