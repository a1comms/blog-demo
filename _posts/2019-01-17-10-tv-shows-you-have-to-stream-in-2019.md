<p>The highly-awaited third season of The Grand Tour hits Prime on 18th January. Binge-watch good old Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May get up to some of the wildest shenanigans and occasionally talk about cars too. It&rsquo;s all about #amazonshitcarshow.</p>
<h5>Catastrophe</h5>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be real &ndash; there are few things as catastrophic as falling pregnant when you&rsquo;re not ready for a child. That&rsquo;s the situation that Rob and Sharon find themselves in shortly after meeting in this quirky romantic(ish) comedy. Season four is out in 2019.</p>
<h5>Mr Robot</h5>
<p>One of Prime&rsquo;s most successful series has to be the thrilling Mr Robot, in which Rami Malek plays a vigilante hacker. If you&rsquo;re not up to date on this show, you might want to get on board. The fourth season of the series is sure to be a must-watch.</p>
<h5>American Gods</h5>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lFt4WlB_Qc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Based on Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s best-selling fantasy novel, American Gods is the smart yet pulse-racing series we&rsquo;d all been waiting for. Season two is out this year and the plot will be following both Shadow and Mr Wednesday in their battle to regain power.</p>
<h5>Jack Ryan</h5>
<p>Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan hit small screens last year and was quite the show-stopper. The action-packed series followed the accidental hero&rsquo;s journey as he deals with everything from terrorist activity to global threats. The second season is penned for August this year.</p>
<h2>5 Binge-Worthy Now TV Entertainment Series</h2>
<h5>Game of Thrones</h5>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wA38GCX4Tb0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Game of Thrones is the series that needs little introduction. If you&rsquo;re balled over by the fantasy-meets-politics plot of this one, you&rsquo;ll be counting down the days until April when the final season is released. How will this epic show end?</p>
<h5>Escape at Dannemora</h5>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>&mdash; NOW TV (@NOWTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/NOWTV/status/1072120821571817472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And now for something completely new&hellip; Escape at Dannemora is directed by the Emmy-winning Ben Stiller and there&rsquo;s been a whole load of hype surrounding it. The mini-series plot will centre on two prisoners as they try to escape a max-security institute.</p>
<h5>True Detective</h5>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZP6t1FmVO8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Are you a crime-lover? True Detective might be the show for you. The first two seasons of this drama each focused on a unique mystery that kept us on the edge of our seats. The third season should be no different and come out later this year on Now TV Entertainment.</p>
<h5>Watchmen</h5>
<p>If you were less than impressed by the 2009 movie adaptation of the Watchmen, here&rsquo;s the great news you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. The classic graphic novel is now getting turned into a series too! The upcoming 2019 series will give a brand-new take on the American superhero vigilante tale.</p>
<h5>Curfew</h5>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hr3EBylHfIQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Starring the likes of Sean Bean, Billy Zane, Adam Brody and Ike Bennett, Curfew is set to be one of the fastest new shows of 2019. The eight-part mini-series focuses on illegal night-time street racing, but we don&rsquo;t know much more than that right now.</p>
