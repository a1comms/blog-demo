<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You won&rsquo;t be able to guess what city is number one.</span></p>
<p>If you were to take a wild stab in the dark, what UK city would you guess has the best 4G? I&rsquo;m no expert here, but I&rsquo;m guessing the majority of you would suggest London. After all, you&rsquo;d imagine the capital city would be ahead of the game technologically. You&rsquo;d think it'd boast the best signal quality and speeds.</p>
<p><em>Well, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong! </em></p>
<p>In fact, according to a new piece of research by <a href="https://opensignal.com/">OpenSignal</a> and <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/?source_code=911CUJ&amp;CMP=KNC-GOOGLE&amp;CMP=Price_test_$ja=cgid:7433303659%7Ctsid:21612%7Ccid:44904709%7Clid:59956268659%7Cnw:g%7Ccrid:174468939070%7Crnd:9010110810992192370%7Cdvc:c%7Cadp:1t1%7Ckw:which%7Cbku:1&amp;campaign=Brand%7C%7CBrand+Related+%26+Misspells%7C%7CSearch&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwoqvIBRD6ls6og8qB77YBEiQAcqqHe24otbRSf3ZtjHGotRBc0K0fJcZaNvS38UxVcBYo_dMaAg0v8P8HAQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CMvE3YWE1tMCFRUC0wodFucJ-A">Which?</a> the greatest places for 4G in the country are cities that you may never expect. The two companies looked at both the best 4G speeds and the best 4G coverage across the UK, and produced some rather surprising results.</p>
<p>At the top of the charts, there was a noticeable lack of the largest UK cities &mdash; London, Birmingham, and Manchester &mdash; instead it was the smaller cities taking the spots. For example, in the battle of the best 4G speeds, it was little old Stoke-on-Trent that won out. What&rsquo;s more, when it came to the best 4G coverage, Middlesbrough and Teesside prevailed! Surprised?</p>

<p>You can see the complete list below, and find out how your city fared when it was pitted against the rest of the country. You may just find that your hometown has surprisingly good connectivity when compared to others in the UK.</p>
<h2>The Fastest 4G Cities</h2>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the best 4G speeds. As you can see, Stoke won this category. According to the research, the city had a whopping LTE download speed of 26.4 Mbps (which means it&rsquo;s darn fast). As if that weren&rsquo;t shocking enough, London came in below average with just 20.5 Mbp of LTE connections.</p>
