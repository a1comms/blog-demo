<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We &#x2764; these emoji! &#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x1f602;</span></p>
<p>Luckily, someone has been keeping tabs on the emoji that people use on Twitter. Yes, the aptly titled <a href="http://emojitracker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emoji Tracker</a> takes note of every single icon that is published on the social media site and puts it into a list. What that means is that we can quickly and easily take a look at what the most (and, sure, the least) popular emoji are.</p>
<p>Since the tracker was created back in 2013, it has logged a whopping 23 billion tweets. The tracker doesn&rsquo;t just look at English language tweets. Oh no, this is far larger than that. It tracks tweets from around the globe &ndash; in multiple languages. But &ndash; let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; the language of emoji is universal.</p>
<h2>The Top 10 emoji On Twitter</h2>
<p>Can <em>you </em>guess what the most used emoji are on the social network? Some of the following might come as a surprise to most of us. Without further ado, here are the top ten icons that have been used on Twitter in the last five years.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x1f602;</li>
<li>&#x2764;</li>
<li>&#x267b;</li>
<li>&#x1f60d;</li>
<li>&#x2665;&#xfe0f; (Heart Suit)</li>
<li>&#x1f62d;</li>
<li>&#x1f60a;</li>
<li>&#x1f612;</li>
<li>&#x1f495;</li>
<li>&#x1f618;</li>
</ol>
<p>The heart faces along with the &lsquo;tears of joy&rsquo; were to be expected. These symbols manage to express emotions that we all feel on a day-to-day basis. Those feelings of love, euphoric joy, and even just pure happiness. We get it.</p>
<p>However, number three on the list is something of a curve ball. Could the fact that we use the recycling symbol by a sign of a more eco-conscious world? Perhaps. But probably not. According to <a href="https://medium.com/@mroth/why-the-emoji-recycling-symbol-is-taking-over-twitter-65ad4b18b04b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Rothenberg</a>, the creator of Emoji Tracker, this symbol is used by many apps and websites to encourage people to retweet content.</p>
<h2>The Least Popular emoji On Twitter</h2>
<p>Should you scroll through your long list of emoji on your phone, you&rsquo;re sure to notice a few that you simply never used. Whether they&rsquo;re just too basic or something that you&rsquo;d never think to depict in picture form, you know the ones I mean. Here are the ten least popular emoji on Twitter.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x1f520;</li>
<li>&#x1f6a1;</li>
<li>&#x1f6b1;</li>
<li>&#x1f523;</li>
<li>&#x1f521;</li>
<li>&#x1f524;</li>
<li>&#x1f6c2;</li>
<li>&#x1f6a0;</li>
<li>&#x1f6af;</li>
<li>&#x1f69e;</li>
</ol>
<p>From the aerial tramway to the passport control emoji, it&rsquo;s plain to see why the above are not so popular. While they functionally depict something, they hardly get your heart racing. Let&rsquo;s face it, how often do you need to show someone the input symbols for symbols? That&rsquo;s right, not very often. Still, they exist.</p>
<p>Who knows what the future may hold? The above symbols may become seriously popular on Twitter (they probably won&rsquo;t!) and things could change dramatically. People may get sick of using the heart emoji and think it&rsquo;s time to mix it up by adding a passport control symbol in for a laugh. Only time will tell what the future holds for the emoji Twittersphere.</p>
