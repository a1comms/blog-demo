<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple has extended its iPhone 5 Battery Replacement Program until January 2016.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6392" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/lightning_hero-1024x548.jpg" alt="iPhone 5 Battery Replacement Program - iPhone 5 Charging" width="960" height="513" />The program, which launched last year, aims to replace (for free) the batteries in a &lsquo;very small percentage&rsquo; of iPhone 5 devices that Apple determines to be faulty.</p>
<p>Apple specify that the iPhone 5 devices in question were sold between September 2012 and January 2013, and may experience shorter battery life, or the need to be charged more frequently than usual.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 Battery Replacement Program was originally initiated to run until January 2015, but a new deadline of January 2016 gives those affected more time to revitalise their iPhone 5.</p>
<p>To ascertain whether your iPhone 5 is eligible for a free battery replacement, use Apple&rsquo;s serial number checker, which can be found <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone5-battery/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Those who do qualify, will need to make an appointment with an Apple Genius at one of Apple&rsquo;s Retail Stores. For those who&rsquo;ve already procured a battery replacement, because of this issue, you may be reimbursed by Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Then again, you could just upgrade to the bigger, better and longer-lasting iPhone 6&hellip; Hashtag just sayin&rsquo;.</strong></p>
