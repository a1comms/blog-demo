<p>We all got off on the wrong foot with Messenger. You know, when Facebook strong-armed us into downloading it, just so we could see our inbox messages.</p>
<p>But our relationship has improved massively since those dark, early days, as it turns out Messenger is a pretty decent app with oodles of features that go beyond standard messaging.</p>
<p>There are so many, in fact, that we&rsquo;re willing to bet you weren&rsquo;t aware of half of these.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our pick of 10 Facebook Messenger tricks that&rsquo;ll change your life. For better or worse.</p>
<h2>1) Shoot some hoops with friends</h2>
<p>Discovering that Facebook had slyly concealed a basketball game in its Messenger app, was somewhere up there with the first time I watched Armageddon. Emotions were running high.</p>

<p>To play, send a basketball emoji to a friend (or multiple friends) and tap it. You&rsquo;ll suddenly find yourself facing a hoop, basketball waiting in front of you, set with the challenge of achieving a higher score than the friend(s) you sent the emoji to.</p>

<h2>2) See your hidden trove of messages</h2>
<p>It turns out we all have this creepy other inbox, full of unwanted messages from people we in no circumstance want to talk to. Basically, when a Facebook user messages you, without first becoming a &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, it gets filtered into this sort of parallel universe for one-way digital conversations.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10507" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/filtered_messages.png" alt="filtered_messages" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>You can see yours by tapping the Settings cog in the bottom right corner, followed by People > Message Requests.</p>

<h2>3) Share your favourite tunes</h2>
<p>Now you can educate friends on your edgy taste in music, by forwarding Spotify tracks to them. Presuming both of you do have Spotify (and Messenger), tap the ellipses icon (&hellip;) to open up the apps menu and scroll down until you see it. The Spotify app will launch, and any tune you select will be sent to the Messenger conversation you were just in.</p>

<h2>4) Give friends ridiculous nicknames</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all got that one mate who&rsquo;s nickname is used so often, you&rsquo;ve no idea what his actual name is. That&rsquo;s until you go on Messenger and you&rsquo;re suddenly reminded. But there&rsquo;s a remedy for that; just tap the person&rsquo;s name you want to change, then Nicknames, and edit away. You can even change your own.</p>

<h2>5) Share your whereabouts</h2>
<p>Just like iMessage and WhatsApp, you can share your current location with a friend and save the bother of mapping out directions. In a conversation, tap the ellipses icon (&hellip;) on the bottom right, followed by Location.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10510" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Messenger-Location.png" alt="Messenger Location" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<h2>6) Go totally OTT with your thumbs up</h2>
<p>Whilst it looks nowhere near as rad as the regular thumbs up emoji, the Facebook Like sticker is iconic. And more scalable apparently, because you can increase the size way beyond what&rsquo;s normal or necessary.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://vine.co/v/eBp0AYA6U9Z/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>To go totally over the top with it, just hold down the thumbs up symbol in the bottom right corner of your chat screen, and watch it wiggle and grow. Lift your finger when you&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;ve achieved the right size.</p>

<h2>7) Message with stealth via your PC</h2>
<p>It turns out you can look busy at work whilst actually talking to mates and winning at life. That&rsquo;s because Messenger has broken free from the confines of mobile, and can be used as normal on the web via your PC. Head over to <a href="https://www.messenger.com/?_rdr" target="_blank">Messenger.com</a> to see for yourself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10501" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Messenger-Website.png" alt="Messenger Website" width="600" height="279" /></p>

<h2>8) Get some you time by muting notifications</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve probably got some overzealous mates who hit the chat a little too hard at times. And there&rsquo;s nothing worse than your mobile phone vibrating relentlessly, notifying you of new messages, when you&rsquo;re otherwise engaged or simply disinterested.</p>
<p>Thankfully there&rsquo;s a diplomatic way of dealing with them, by quietly muting notifications for a time of your choosing &ndash; between 15 minutes and an entire day. Select your time-out by tapping the &lsquo;i' in the top right corner, then Notifications.</p>

<h2>9) Share photos using facial recognition</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m equally as impressed as I am disturbed by Messenger&rsquo;s ability to identify friends in your photos, and then suggest who to send them to. But whatever your thoughts, it&rsquo;s a massive time-saver if you&rsquo;re wanting to directly share a chunky album full of numerous friends.</p>
<p>Try it by tapping the Settings cog on the bottom bar, going to Photos &amp; Media and enabling Photo Magic. You&rsquo;ll be asked if you want to send the photos; nothing is sent automatically.</p>

<p><em>N.B. At the time of writing, Photo Magic was only available on Android.</em></p>

<h2>10) Colour code your conversations</h2>
<p>Feel like Facebook&rsquo;s dark slate blue doesn&rsquo;t quite match your vibrant personality? You can change the colour of your conversations (the text bubbles and icons), choosing from a palette of swatches. Just tap a person&rsquo;s name and select a hue of your preference.</p>

<p><strong>Now you&rsquo;re the master of Messenger, see what other hidden gems you can find buried within.</strong></p>
