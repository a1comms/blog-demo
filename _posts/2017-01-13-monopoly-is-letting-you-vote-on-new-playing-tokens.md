<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Possible new Monopoly tokens include a hashtag, jet ski, wink emoji and 47 others.</span></p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we can all agree on, it&rsquo;s that our childhood is a sacred thing. Sure, years later, it may be nothing more than a series of disconnected memories, but it&rsquo;s still something we&rsquo;ll always treasure. What&rsquo;s more, no one should be able to change it, in anyway.</p>
<p>If one of your favourite memories of growing up involved a certain Monopoly board, we have some news for you&hellip; You may want to grab a cup of tea first, and make sure you&rsquo;re sitting comfortably.</p>
<p>Okay. Here it goes. Hasbro, the company that makes Monopoly, is preparing to overhaul its much-beloved playing tokens, replacing every single one with an updated, more current line-up.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmonopoly%2Fvideos%2F10154165350591517%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Actually, if you&rsquo;ve been paying close attention to newer editions of Monopoly, this has quietly been going on for some time. Back in 2013, Hasbro was flat-out done with the iron, and got rid; then just last year, the boot got the... boot.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. Hasbro isn&rsquo;t selecting the new range of playing pieces on its own. Oh no, something <em>much </em>more exciting is afoot. The public has been trusted with an opportunity to choose what pieces feature on upcoming editions of the board.</p>
<p>We all know what happened the last time the public was given a similar opportunity&hellip;</p>

<p>"The Monopoly Token Madness Vote lets our passionate fans choose all eight tokens in the Monopoly game and no token &ndash; not even Scottie dog &ndash; is safe," explained Jonathan Berkowitz, the senior vice president of marketing at Hasbro Gaming.</p>
<p>"Only time will tell if fans will decide to stay with the classics, keep a few favourites or pick an entirely new line-up of tokens."</p>
<h2>How to Vote</h2>
<p>There are more than 50 new tokens to choose from, including a hashtag, mobile phone (our personal favourite) and a winky face emoji. To have your say in gaming history, vote for your favourite Monopoly tokens at <a href="http://www.votemonopoly.com/?locale=en-gb" target="_blank">VoteMonopoly.com</a>.</p>

<p>Hasbro will be announcing the pieces with the top votes on 19th March (that&rsquo;s World Monopoly Day, FYI) and we will see the pieces included with new Monopoly editions from August 2017. Cast your votes&hellip; NOW!</p>
