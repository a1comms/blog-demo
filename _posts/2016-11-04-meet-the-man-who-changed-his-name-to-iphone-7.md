<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Call yourself an Apple fanboy? This guy disagrees.</span></p>
<p>iPhone 7 was one of the most hotly-awaited products of 2016, and for good reason. It&rsquo;s bang-tidy smartphone capable of all sorts of magical things, from is sleek, waterproof design, to its new surround speakers, along with a load of other extras we&rsquo;ve previously talked about.</p>
<p>As such, upon iPhone 7&rsquo;s grand unveiling, people we&rsquo;re practically crawling over one another to get their hands on one. The usual tales followed; people camping out all night long, queuing up for hours on end to be the first in store, high-fiving the Apple Geniuses (customer service staff, to you and I) as they finally got their prize. You know the ones.</p>

<p>While there&rsquo;s no doubt that each time Apple releases a new product, approximately half the population descends into anarchy, some people go just a little further than others&hellip;</p>
<p>The question is: How far would you go to get Apple&rsquo;s latest creation in your back pocket? Would you queue up all night? Stand for hours in the cold? Or&hellip; wait for it&hellip; legally change your name to iPhone 7?</p>
<p>That last question might have just thrown you a little, but it&rsquo;s actually precisely what a Ukrainian man resorted to. The 20-year-old in question, formerly known as Olexander Turin, was so set on getting the latest iPhone that he went to seriously extreme lengths to get it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12207" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/11/iphone-7-guy.jpg" alt="iphone-7-guy" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>When one store offered out five free iPhone 7 units to the first five customers to change their name, presumably as some sort of joke, Olexander jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>Rather than forking out hundreds for the device, he legally changes his name to iPhone Sim, at a cost of roughly &pound;1.50 (in case your Ukrainian is a little rusty, &lsquo;sim&rsquo; directly translates as &lsquo;seven&rsquo;). Seems like a real bargain, right? Of course, the young man won his iPhone 7 and has since made international news.</p>
<p>Before you consider following in his footsteps, remember this one fundamental truth. Apple changes its products every year. Sometimes, it feels like as soon as you get a new device, the next one is about to launch. But your name? That&rsquo;s sacred. It&rsquo;s something that follows you around for the <em>rest </em>of your life&hellip;</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you change it back.</p>
