<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">App shortcuts, floating buttons, and new modes.</span></p>
<p>The much-awaited Samsung Galaxy S8 is finally yours to buy. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to already own one, there are a load of extra features you should know about.</p>
<p>Samsung really upped its game with this smartphone, so much so that we found out 15 hidden bonus features that you probably didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Try these out for size!</p>
<h2>1) Easy Zoom In and Out</h2>
<p>One of the best camera shortcuts on Samsung Galaxy S8 must be the zoom in and out function. You no longer need mess around with menus to get this to work. Instead, just slide up or down on the display shutter button to adjust your zoom level. Simples!</p>

<h2>2) Unlock the Floating Camera Button</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to take a selfie or, indeed, the perfect family portrait, the position of the camera button can sometimes be a bit of a pain. If the angle isn&rsquo;t quite right, it&rsquo;s difficult trying to reach.</p>
<p>In the camera settings, though, you can unlock a floating camera button that allows you to click anywhere on the screen to take a photo. No overstretched fingers, finally!</p>

<h2>3) Brighten Up Your Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>The navigation bar at the bottom of Samsung Galaxy S8 display has a hidden feature that you may not know about just yet. If you head to your settings, you can change the colour of the bar to a custom one of your choice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14153" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9JeXKf7HBVmAcRtZ_GEImMWvtUNXqAbHB9TeO1ciewUO_np_y3_TBNSrzpFo0A8q06z_PqANCnmgjNZTX-ojJPA=s0" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<h2>4) Unlock Your Lock Screen, for Good!</h2>
<p>If, for whatever reason, you feel that you just don&rsquo;t need a lock screen, perhaps because you&rsquo;re an open individual, you can get rid of it.</p>
<p>On Samsung Galaxy S8, that&rsquo;s entirely possible to achieve in your security settings, so your phone doesn&rsquo;t lock when you leave it untouched for a while.</p>
<h2>5) Left or Right? You Decide</h2>
<p>When you take your Samsung Galaxy S8 out the box, the dynamic back button sits on the left of the display, and navigation buttons on the right.</p>
<p>However, if this doesn&rsquo;t work for you, you can swap them around. Just head to settings and choose the best layout for your navigation bar.</p>

<h2>6) Get the Sensitivity Just Right</h2>
<p>As you probably know, the home button on Samsung Galaxy S8 is rather sensitive. However, if you feel that you&rsquo;d like it to be less so, you can change the sensitivity level by heading to the settings menu.</p>
<h2>7) Right-Click on Your Apps</h2>
<p>Try long pressing an app icon and you&rsquo;ll be in for something of a surprise. You see, this unlocks a mini &lsquo;app shortcut&rsquo; box with a few options you can try without opening the full app. It&rsquo;s like a right-click for phones. Go on, give it a go.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14154" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8WSaM7PSsX2dHDwTcYSt_RDRZJmv1c0aUVQPTTcty4Z69HkqYq3v93qCO-SCvn7Nxw5Q9Nj7BAMmg5aj9JaXo0De=s0" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<h2>8) Don&rsquo;t Forget to Right-Click Samsung&rsquo;s Apps</h2>
<p>You might think that Samsung&rsquo;s own apps wouldn&rsquo;t support a long press, or &lsquo;right-click&rsquo;, for shortcut options. Well, here&rsquo;s the surprise: they do. Try it on apps like the Camera.</p>

<h2>9) Finally Start (and Stick to) That Diet</h2>
<p>The Samsung Health app just got a whole load fancier. It has expert advice, dietary tips, and support that will help you reach your fitness goals in no time at all. Phew! That should make keeping healthy a whole load easier.</p>

<h2>10) Put Everything Within Reach</h2>
<p>Yes, screens may be getting bigger, but our hands have sadly remained the same old size. If you struggle to reach the corners of the screen with just one hand, put the phone into &lsquo;one handed&rsquo; mode. That means that you get a smaller version of the screen to the side of the phone. Hit the home button three times to switch to this mode.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14156" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oxWgbBpU_uHvd8w51M3R-Hev6xafSc6xnIHLbftY5T1Nu3JH4IKQA8iBbGYE2ZEhhV0IfQxpAF2oWyd9Sp7P1Bo=s0" width="600" height="400" /></p>

<h2>11) Switch Back to Two-Hand Mode</h2>
<p>Once both hands are free again, you might want to go back to the normal sized screen. Use the settings gear to the side of the screen to switch back. After a while, this will feel like the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<h2>12) Boost Your Battery Life</h2>
<p>Are you draining through battery too quickly? If you&rsquo;re doing lots of high-performance tasks, like playing games, you&rsquo;ll use up plenty of power. To ensure your Galaxy S8 lasts a little longer, switch on performance mode in the settings.</p>

<h2>13) Share Videos Quickly and Easily</h2>
<p>Sending a video to a pal has never been quite so fast! Using the Samsung Cloud Link Sharing feature takes mere seconds to send over a file of up to 1GB. Now, go ahead, start sharing those oh-so-hilarious clips.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14159" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MxtzWCRI9BeDizYYyjhKGYGrCEMXOZtjrV7KBZehloOqPFeAsOKBxYxFXbunt1GGzW2MHPGl6YdWVo76f060Xtp6=s0" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<h2>14) Save that Interesting Article for Later</h2>
<p>When browsing the web, and you come across a page that you want to come back to, perhaps an article you don&rsquo;t have time to read right now, you can save it for later. Just press <strong>Share </strong>> <strong>Reminders</strong> and you can get a reminder for the link whenever you need it.</p>

<h2>15) A Brand New App Button</h2>
<p>Most Samsung owners are used to swiping up on the home screen to get to certain apps. However, you can change this feature so that you have a dedicated app button on the main navigation bar. So. Many. Choices.</p>
