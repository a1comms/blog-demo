<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Go home, Facebook&hellip; You&rsquo;re drunk!</span></p>
<p>Cast your mind back! There once was a time when we&rsquo;d see a Facebook notification pop up and get little butterflies in our stomach. That small red dot really meant something back then; someone had liked our picture or commented on our status. Sadly, those days are over.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that Facebook will update us with just about any nonsense that happens at any given time... As if we give a damn. Not sure what I&rsquo;m talking about? Well, here are just 10 of the most annoying Facebook notifications you can ever get.</p>
<h2>1) Someone Saying &lsquo;Hello&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Um, what is this notification all about? It seems to be a modern-day version of the &lsquo;poke&rsquo; (ah, memories). It&rsquo;s pointless to have a function where people can just say &lsquo;hello&rsquo; at the click of a button. Like, can&rsquo;t they just message you instead?</p>

<h2>2) Someone is &lsquo;Live&rsquo; on Facebook</h2>
<p>What is the &lsquo;Live&rsquo; feature all about? Why do people use it? Basically, every time that annoying friend decides to make a not-so-insightful live video of them making French toast, you get to hear about it. Genius.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14095" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KIWvxw6xaBTyVJAl2IMveeP0GwXr3aeNRcRDZ5u7I_KssmM29gRj-cc2f9nzbrwr7DQcb-2kAE4S606jsVu1mxA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>3) [Venue name] Added a New Event near You</h2>
<p>Admittedly, Facebook is useful when it comes to finding out about new events. However, most of us don&rsquo;t want (or need) to know every <em>single </em>time a new event is created near us. Come on, now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14096" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A5RqturEnWQJ4OZk5deW88LumetksiuWMreLvQYezm0WN-QTTXcnQM0TJatxJSMy29e6LO-HnMIsKNDsgvjBgZrB=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>4) Your Friends Are Going to an Event near You</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one that plays on your deepest fears. We&rsquo;ve all worried that people were hanging out without us in the past. Back in the day, though, we didn&rsquo;t have a social media platform to confirm it for us. Gee, thanks, Facebook.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14098" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kdQuqyow5k61Iw0vXe9dQvdlCJBrrntv9ZBQ6NRx3kqzd_-0jjpcuHahUwWXXp61M5Y01l8vI9NA6JP6uYaZ52CsAA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>5) Your Friend is Using Messenger</h2>
<p>Um, so what? Here&rsquo;s one of Facebook&rsquo;s silliest notifications. If you wanted to start a conversation with someone, you would just go ahead and do it, right? You really don&rsquo;t need to be prompted by a really dumb notification.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Facebook sending a push notification for every time a friend starts using Messenger might be the worst move yet.</p>

<h2>6) It&rsquo;s So-and-So&rsquo;s Birthday</h2>
<p>If this person was more than a mere acquaintance, you would already <em>know </em>about their birthday. You would already have bought them a gift or sent them a text. You don&rsquo;t need a notification to tell you about the big day. Pipe down, Facebook.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14100" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hupN3WPvihP9bpzO-AFpdcEHoiYCwLQIhReIsQwdUX5AttM_m0Dt6Mqlv1JkEjjn7R6xKgOsyphcXM47YS8DH7tl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>7) You Have One New Memory to Look at</h2>
<p>In theory, the whole &lsquo;memories&rsquo; feature should be kind of cool. However, what the pros at Facebook <em>fail </em>to realise is that there are some things we all want to forget. No one wants to see how happy they were with their ex this time last year&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14101" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tLlBIS3HqPkqaLvua3PChLjPhIRMBR8Y_w0ytCTYf_u9YOMk0Ryd6uF7xlCDLnXc9OWiamWeb6bdiN7sU6l4JFQgEQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>8) So-and-So Added a New Photo</h2>
<p>Why does Facebook need to tell us when our friends add photos or update their statuses? Um, surely that&rsquo;s what the whole &lsquo;newsfeed&rsquo; is about. Weird.</p>
<h2>9) Celebrate Your Upcoming Birthday</h2>
<p>Because all of us forget our birthdays, right? Wrong. No one on the face of this planet needs reminding that their <em>own </em>birthday is coming up. Sorry, but, no.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Does anyone else find this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash">#Facebook</a> notification weird? Why would I plan my own birthday party? &#x1f602; &#x1f388; &#x1f382; <a href="https://t.co/2mTZNakxPu">pic.twitter.com/2mTZNakxPu</a></p>

<h2>10) Take a Look at this Marketplace Item</h2>
<p>Facebook is <em>not </em>being helpful telling us that we can buy things in our area. We know that. If we were thinking about shopping, we&rsquo;d click the marketplace tab ourselves. Psh&hellip; Don&rsquo;t be so pushy, Facebook!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just got a notification to take a look at this marketplace item that might interest me... <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook">@facebook</a> why do you think I would like a 2x2 slab <a href="https://t.co/Aw0UGozxjy">pic.twitter.com/Aw0UGozxjy</a></p>
