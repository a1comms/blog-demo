<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">They're both out of this world, but which is best, there's only one way to find out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re a lover of all things Samsung, you likely have a hard decision right about now. The tech giant recently announced the launch of the Note 8 and, let&rsquo;s be honest, it looks pretty darn incredible. Still, there&rsquo;s a rival device already on the market &mdash;&nbsp;the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus &mdash; which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be just as good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, which should you choose? Before you decide, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what each phone has to offer. Here&rsquo;s just about everything you need to know:</span></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sit the Note 8 and S8 Plus side-by-side, you will see that there are few differences between the two. These two are less twins and more similar-looking siblings. The Note 8 is a little taller and generally larger than the S8 Plus, though, and comes in at 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6mm. On the other hand, the S8 Plus is just 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm. It&rsquo;s not a major difference, but you will notice it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range of colours is different here too. If you want the latest Samsung Galaxy Note 8, you can nab it in Midnight Black and Maple Gold. The S8 Plus is a little different, offered in Midnight Black, Orchid Grey and Arctic Silver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the above differences are extremely minor, which means that you will hardly notice the change. The chances are that if you like one of these devices, you will like them both.</span></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is one of the biggest we&rsquo;ve ever seen. At 6.3-inches, you will struggle to find a device like this one on the market right now. What&rsquo;s more, the specs are incredible &mdash;&nbsp;it packs an awesome 1,440 x 2,960 Super AMOLED punch. Make no mistakes, it&rsquo;s hard to rival this one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Galaxy S8 Plus is only a little bit neater (6.2-inches, actually), it does feel smaller here when you&rsquo;re using it. What&rsquo;s more, the picture density is not quite as impressive, which is clear to see. So, if you&rsquo;re all about the screen, getting the Note 8 may be the way forward for you.</span></p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s a real difference in RAM between the S8 Plus and the Note 8. While the S8 has a reasonable 4GB RAM, Samsung have taken things one step further with the Note 8. The latter packs a whopping 6GB RAM, which is sure to win fans over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, there&rsquo;s very little between these two phones. They both run Android 7.1.1 and pack a whole load of power too. Whether you&rsquo;re playing games, keeping in touch with contacts, or even multitasking, you should have no problem on either phone. This is one of the areas in which Samsung really does excel, and so you can expect the very best.</span></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfie enthusiasts will want to know just one thing here. Which phone has the better camera? Well, this is an area on which Samsung have really focussed their attention right now. That means that the Note 8 has a far better camera than the S8 Plus! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you get with the Note 8? Well, on the rear camera, you&rsquo;ll find dual 12MP lenses, one of which is telephoto. (In short, that means that you get extra clarity when zooming in on pictures and a few extra features!) You also have the option to blur out the background of your images after you&rsquo;ve taken them. Neat, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s fair to say that things have already come a long way since the days of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. The device has a less powerful rear camera, with just one 12MP lens. That means that it doesn&rsquo;t have the little extra features that you get with a dual lens snapper. On the other hand, the front facing lenses (i.e. selfie cams) are the same on both phones, coming in at 8MP each!</span></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s really little between the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the S8 Plus when it comes to features. Both have a whole load of snazzy things that you can do. Highlights include the fingerprint and iris scanners, &lsquo;Infinity Display&rsquo;, and a powerful CPU to boot. Aside from focussing on the camera, size and RAM, there isn&rsquo;t much in it here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when you get a Note device, you also get the S Pen (which does not come with other Samsung models). So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a phablet you can write on just like a notepad, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is sure to be the way to go.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, which phone should you get? Well, frankly, that&rsquo;s for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to decide. Both the Note 8 and the S8 Plus have their merits. If you&rsquo;re looking for a great flagship device with all the latest features packed into the palm of your hand, you won&rsquo;t go wrong with the S8 Plus. It really is a stellar phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the extra RAM, improved camera, wider screen, and S Pen, all mean that the Note 8 is indeed an upgrade. What&rsquo;s more, if all of the above appeal to you, it could well be worth paying a little extra and getting the latest device.</span></p>
