<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple has announced a premium buying experience to go along with its premium smartwatch, Apple Watch Edition, including a private, hour-long trying-on appointment, a dedicated technical support line, and a <em>complete</em> lack of queueing...</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6453 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/apple-watch-edition.jpg" alt="Apple Watch Edition" width="700" height="450" /></p>
<p>Apple Watch is undoubtedly one of the most eagerly awaited smartwatches yet unveiled, with one of the high points of the whole affair being that the watch itself comes in three different &lsquo;flavours&rsquo;: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition.</p>
<p>The most high-end of those three different versions is Apple Watch Edition, and Apple has now announced what <em>extra</em> perks you&rsquo;ll get if you plan on buying one.</p>
<p>It all comes down to what&rsquo;s known as the &lsquo;purchasing path&rsquo; (the purchasing path in your local supermarket, for instance, might be &ldquo;queue for twenty minutes&rdquo;), and Apple has refined the process, to make it &ldquo;extremely personal, elegant, and purposeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process of buying an Apple Watch Edition will involve a private appointment, within a specific area dedicated <em>just</em> to that smartwatch, and the appointment can last up to an hour.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve actually picked out and bought an Apple Watch Edition, you can then set it up (i.e. connect it up to, and get it working with, your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus) either in-store, or at home with a new service called Virtual Personal Setup.</p>
<p>Essentially, this new service will allow you to video conference with an Apple rep, doing in the comfort of your own home what would normally be done face-to-face, in the store.</p>
<p>All Apple Watch customers get that option, but people buying Apple Watch Edition get an exclusive phone line (which also gives you two years of 24/7 tech support).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you do have to go into a store to buy an Edition, you won&rsquo;t have to queue, either.</p>
<p><strong>The Apple Watch Edition has a premium price tag, but for that, it turns out that you get a premium service, as well as a premium watch! </strong></p>
