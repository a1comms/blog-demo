<h2>The App</h2>
<p>The Team GB Winter Olympics App has been designed to keep us Olympics fans right up to date with everything that&rsquo;s going on for the duration of the games, 9th-25th February.</p>
<p>It's essentially a news app first, with almost up to the minute notifications and updates. Great news if you're keeping your eye on specific athlete's medal hopes, and don't have a TV around to be enjoying the action on.</p>
<p>You can also learn about and read up on all the different sports, and which GB athletes are competing and when. This app will soon become your favourite companion if you love all things Olympics.</p>

<p>British Olympic Association, Commercial Director, Tim Ellerton, commented on the new app saying:&nbsp;&ldquo;We are constantly looking at ways to engage with our fans and the app that Visa created during Rio 2016 was a huge success, which provided brilliant up to the second updates and information." He continued to say: "...we&rsquo;re excited to develop and extend the scope of what the app can offer to fans and it is great to be able to share the app today in the build-up to PyeongChang 2018.&rdquo;</p>
