<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google has confirmed that the next version of Android will be called Marshmallow. Join us as we take a look at the new features that should be wending their way onto future phones...</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finally been confirmed: the &ldquo;M&rdquo; in Android M does, as many people suspected, stand for &ldquo;Marshmallow&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good, of course, but there&rsquo;s one big question that must surely be on the lips of everyone who loves Android.</p>
<p>What new stuff will Android M give us?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>App Permissions</strong></span></h2>
<p>This one has been a long time coming, but it&rsquo;s almost upon us; from Android M onwards, you&rsquo;ll be able to opt-out of giving apps permission to do specific things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something users have been crying out for, quite frankly, for absolutely <em>ages</em> so seeing it in Android M is <em>really</em> gratifying!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Chrome Custom Tabs &amp; App Links</strong></span></h2>
<p>You know how, when you tap a link in an app, it brings up a dialogue box asking you what app you want to use to open that link? Well that&rsquo;s going to change, soon, as well.</p>
<p>Android is about to get <em>much</em> cleverer at recognising which app should open which links, and Chrome will be able to open a custom tab as an overlay, allowing developers to build a custom Chrome tab into their app.</p>
<p>By doing that, you&rsquo;ll be able to browse the link through the app itself, without having to leave it.</p>
<p>So, tap a Twitter link in your email, and Android M will open the Twitter app without asking you which service to use, for instance, and the end result will be a vastly sleeker web experience.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Fingerprint Recognition</strong></span></h2>
<p>Fingerprint recognition has been seen in previous Android phones (Samsung Galaxy S6 and S5 spring immediately to mind), but Google has decided to &ldquo;standardise support&rdquo; for it in Android M.</p>
<p>But what does that mean? Android will now, by default, manage the fingerprint recognition software, which will make it easier for manufacturers to get their own fingerprint scanners working, and as such, we&rsquo;re likely to see this pop up in a lot more phones.</p>
<p>Oh, and just like the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6, Android M will also allow you to make mobile payments using your fingerprint as ID (with Android Pay being the default system for doing that).</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Power Management</strong></span></h2>
<p>Modern smartphones are power-hungry beasts, as everyone knows, but Android M includes a new feature called Doze.</p>
<p>What Doze does is use the sensors in your phone to recognise when it&rsquo;s not in use, so it can cut down the number of background tasks running when you&rsquo;re not actually operating the phone.</p>
<p>The end result, if Google&rsquo;s tests translate to the real world, will be a doubling of your battery life!</p>
<p>Android M will also support USB Type-C, allowing for faster charging, and it will even let you charge other devices with your phone!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>UI Improvements</strong></span></h2>
<p>Google always includes a few UI refinements in each new version of Android, and Marshmallow is no exception; not only is there a new, vertically-scrolling app drawer, but the homescreen will now be rotatable, so you can view it in landscape format.</p>
<p>Also rumoured (as in &ldquo;it was in the first developer preview build but bizarrely isn&rsquo;t in this latest build&rdquo;) are Themes.</p>
<p>We really hope this feature makes it into the final release, as being able to change the entire look of your phone with one tap is brilliant (plus, it&rsquo;s something third party launchers such as those by HTC or Samsung already do, so Google arguably needs to include this, so they don&rsquo;t get left behind).</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Visual Voicemail</strong></span></h2>
<p>Finally, we have something which is hinted at, but not directly confirmed as yet: Visual Voicemail, similar to what you&rsquo;ll find in the iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not known yet how it will be implemented, or whether any networks in the UK will support it, but this could end up being something potentially brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>And so, we begin the long wait for the final version of Android Marshmallow to appear. We reckon this one&rsquo;s going to be very exciting, so watch this space for more news! </strong></p>
