<p><span class="postStandFirst">It seems that even the animal kingdom is not free from the over-saturation of the digital world&hellip; as these Magellanic penguins prove as they play a game on the iPad!</span></p>
<p>Californian zoo, Aquarium of the Pacific, based in Long Beach, now holds regular iPad gaming sessions for its penguins, who appear to love nothing more than pecking at the screen in hot pursuit of a virtual mouse!</p>
<p>The game, originally intended for cats and ingeniously named &lsquo;Game for Cats&rsquo;, engrosses the penguins so much that zoo keepers claim it helps them to keep the creatures still so they can be examined for longer.</p>
<p>Zoo volunteer, Hugo Ryono, first experimented with the game at the zoo in 2013, and says: &ldquo;Just like cats, penguins are very curious and the idea of these birds following a virtual mouse on a screen was just too appealing not to try out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently, one of the penguins is even a high-scorer on the game, racking up a total of 1600 points.</p>
<p><strong>Want to see if you can beat the penguin&rsquo;s high score? Grab yourself an iPad from just &pound;14.21 a month in our Tech Shop and get playing!</strong><br />
