<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple is taking on Snapchat and Instagram with its new app, Clips.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the next best app, you might just have found it. Very soon, Apple will be asking us all to &lsquo;Spread some video joy&rsquo; using its upcoming iOS app, Clips.</p>
<p>The video sharing platform will allow Apple users to take, edit, and share video clips with some of their nearest and dearest friends. What&rsquo;s more, there are a whole load of graphics, effects, and filters you can use to spruce up the videos too. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Live Titles - Narrate Your Own Life</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13594" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VJPILkzI0DdLNGUFUyRpht5kTuDeVl4dqlcU0RT31M_YXOi-jeCpNSdzbjw-WtUidNMmalSyvrNXwMyz5OAN6lWpGw=s0" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>Every video is made better with captions. That&rsquo;s where Live Titles comes into play.</p>
<p>As you record a video, you can commentate on what&rsquo;s happening to create live on-screen captions. You can tell watches what they&rsquo;re seeing, as they&rsquo;re seeing it. From describing the video action to adding fun observations, there&rsquo;s no end to what you can do here. Just press record, then talk away.</p>
<h2>Get Your Filters on Fleek</h2>
<p>What would a video sharing app be without a range of filters? That&rsquo;s right, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Clips&nbsp;boasts a load of filters that help your videos stand out from the crowd. There are, of course, your pretty standard Instagram-like filters, which we all know and love. However, there are also some cool effects that do things like convert your video into a cartoon! It&rsquo;s well worth playing around with Clips, once you get it, to see what weird and wonderful results you can produce.</p>
<h2>Say it Best with Emoji</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13595" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/568w3iQOCSLHL7w6Cy5MIcbI95BdqsBGK2brOxh4Z5VyglJAK4shlI5o7f8yD26dA4CSMwxTGEoLgtN4zio4P3k6_A=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, when people watch your videos, what you want is for them to <em>feel </em>something special. But wait, what if they don&rsquo;t get your message right away? Well, why not add a few expressive emoji into the mix?</p>
<p>When you slap a few &lsquo;Sad Face&rsquo; emoji onto the video, the people you share it with will know just how you want them to feel as they watch it. As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, you can also apply some neat overlays, like speech bubbles and arrows. You get the picture.</p>
<h2>Jazz Your Videos Up</h2>
<p>What will truly set Apple Clips apart from competitors is the feature that adds music to your videos. Just choose a tune, and the app automatically trims the music length down to fit the video, doing the hard work for you. Adding a little melody to your clip is certain to give it some extra pizazz.</p>
<h2>Smart Suggestions for Sharing</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13596" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CkXjhx3G0mol-e2dDdb74ilAwvceyw_3UoFVoZCLUXjifTR96tPlrMtk3qb9b9gVWOM26V1cSBRjTr_8vVqTVxA_=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, Clips makes so-called &lsquo;smart suggestions&rsquo; when you&rsquo;ve completed a video. It looks at who&rsquo;s featured in the scene and will suggest who to share the clip with. One tap of your smartphone screen and you can share your latest video masterpiece with all your besties. Watch out Spielberg.</p>
<h2>When Can I Download Clips?</h2>
<p>Good question. The simple answer is we don&rsquo;t yet know. Apple&rsquo;s website states that Clips is &lsquo;coming soon&rsquo;. According to online sources, it will likely launch in April 2017. We&rsquo;ll bring you more when we know.</p>
