<p><span class="postStandFirst">Excitement has been at fever pitch, as we all waited with anticipation for the launch of HTC&rsquo;s newest flagship, and now that it has been, we can say with absolute certainty that the all new HTC One M8 does not disappoint!</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to simply say that the&nbsp;HTC One M8&nbsp;is a brilliant phone (because it&nbsp;<em>is</em>), but&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;is it so brilliant?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at 5 reasons why, to put it plainly, the HTC One M8 is incredible...</p>
<h2>1) Catwalk Looks</h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HTC-One-M8-Press-Photo-4-1280x768.jpg" width="580" height="347" /></strong></p>
<p>The original HTC One was already a serious looker, but the new HTC One M8 takes things to the next level; whereas the original&rsquo;s body was made of 70% metal, the successor&rsquo;s body is made of 90% metal, and the end result is a phone that&rsquo;s truly stunning to look at. In addition, more curves have been introduced into the design and where, previously, there was a more squared-off edge where the back of the phone met the sides, it&rsquo;s now been given a more gentle curve, making it as nice to hold as it is to look at.</p>
<p>Plus, of course, there&rsquo;s the 5-inch 1080p screen, which is, as always, a joy to behold.</p>
<h2>2) Awesome Power</h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3803/13408576203_e11fd575d6.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p>The Snapdragon 801 processor is making a name for itself as one of the best smartphone processors ever made. That is the chip that makes the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5 so fast and powerful, and now, the same processor can be found in the HTC One M8, clocked at 2.3GHz.</p>
<p>Combined with 2GB of RAM, that makes the HTC One M8 as powerful as it is beautiful!</p>
<h2>3) Smart Software</h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2843/13408853974_bf26cd7944.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p>Android is a powerhouse of an operating system, but HTC has taken it and made it even better, with the addition of the newest incarnation of their Sense UI (which, as it&rsquo;s version 6, HTC apparently likes to call &ldquo;The Sixth Sense&rdquo;, although presumably Bruce Willis isn&rsquo;t involved in any capacity).</p>
<p>The biggest addition is what HTC calls Motion Launch, which allows you to unlock the phone, while the display is turned off, simply by swiping (or double-tapping) on the screen.</p>
<h2>4) Stereo Sound</h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/13408513915_4cb619ce1a.jpg" /></strong></p>
<p>The original HTC One had stereo speakers, and so does the HTC One M8, once again labelled as BoomSound speakers. They&rsquo;ve been made even better, though, so the sound this phone produces must be heard to be believed; as a music player, there now aren&rsquo;t many phones that can match it!</p>
<h2>5) A Camera Made Of&nbsp;<em>Magic</em></h2>
<p>While all the previous points are good, this is where it gets&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;exciting, because we now know why the HTC One M8 has two lenses on the back. The smaller of the two is actually a depth sensor, which allows the HTC One M8 to know exactly how far away each object in the scene is, and separate them into&nbsp;<em>foreground</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>background</em>&nbsp;objects. Why is this important?</p>
<p>Quite simply, it allows you to do some&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;clever things with your photos, things that no other phone can do. You can change the focus of the pic, swapping focus between foreground or background,&nbsp;<em>after the photo has been taken</em>. You can apply effects&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;to the foreground or background, to place a friend you photographed into something like an A-Ha video. The camera in the HTC One M8 might not match the megapixel count of some other smartphones, but what it has, instead, is&nbsp;<em>truly</em>&nbsp;cutting-edge technology that no other phone can match.</p>
