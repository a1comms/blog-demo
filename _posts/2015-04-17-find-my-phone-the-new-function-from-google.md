<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google has revealed a new service, called Find My Phone, allowing you to locate a lost handset via Google Search. While there are some limitations (not being able to locate the phone if mobile data isn&rsquo;t turned on), this new service could prove to be very useful indeed...</span></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever spent hours turning your house upside down, after realising that you&rsquo;ve lost your phone? Do you wish there was an easy way to find it when that happens, something a bit more high-tech and reliable than key-rings you whistle at?</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6587 " src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Google-Find-My-Phone.png" alt="Google - Find My Phone" width="598" height="460" /></p>
<p>According to a new Google+ post from Google itself, there&rsquo;s now a super-easy way to find your phone, if you lose it.</p>
<p>So, how do you do it? Simple: all you need to do is make sure you&rsquo;re logged in to Google&rsquo;s services on your PC, and then type &ldquo;Find My Phone&rdquo; into the Google search box. The service will then ping your phone, and use the phone&rsquo;s location data to work out where it is (during our tests earlier today, the service was accurate to 45 metres). The phone&rsquo;s location is then shown to you on Google Maps, so you know whether it <em>is</em> in the house, or whether you left it in the pub, for example.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if your phone is registering as nearby &ndash; implying it <em>is </em>in the house &ndash; you can click a button on the page, and it will make your phone ring at full volume for 5 minutes (or until you press the power button), so you can track it down.</p>
<p>There are a couple of caveats to the service, of course. Firstly, it won&rsquo;t work unless you have mobile data turned on, so if it&rsquo;s <em>not</em>, the service won&rsquo;t be able to locate the phone. Secondly, this service doesn&rsquo;t allow you to, say, wipe and lock the phone; you&rsquo;d need to use the Android Device Manager to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless, if you do lose your phone, and you need help finding it, this new, free service could be an absolute godsend! </strong></p>
