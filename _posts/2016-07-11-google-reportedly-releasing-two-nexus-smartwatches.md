<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s time Google took matters into its own hands.</span></p>
<p>Android &ndash; the operating system built by Google &ndash; is one of the most popular and adaptable tech platforms. It&rsquo;s compatible with many of our smartphones, tablets, TVs and even our cars.</p>
<p>But one hardware podium Android has failed to successfully climb, is smartwatches.</p>
<p>The smartwatch iteration of Android, appropriately labelled Android Wear, now exists in its second form, and though manufacturers like Sony and Motorola are producing supporting smartwatches, the Android Wear ethos hasn&rsquo;t done a lot for the industry. Certainly not by Android-for-mobile&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the wearables market seems to be underperforming as a whole, though Apple is doing a far better job than anyone else, selling six times more than its nearest competitor in 2015. Despite that, Apple&rsquo;s still curiously reticent when it comes to sales figures.</p>
<h2>Google's fishing for answers</h2>
<p>According to reports, Google&rsquo;s decided to take control of its own destiny (well, the destiny of Android Wear), by manufacturing two Nexus smartwatches. And to bolster them, Google&rsquo;s also working on a third, more powerful, more capable version of Android Wear.</p>
<p>Dubbed Nexus Angelfish and Nexus Swordfish, both smartwatches are rumoured to sport circular watch faces, though Angelfish will apparently be larger and also feature built-in LTE capabilities, GPS and heart rate readings, making it a potential choice for fitness fanatics.</p>
<p>Nexus Swordfish will likely be a more affordable device, with diluted specs to show for it. Judging by the concept image featured above, both smartwatches appear to hold a lot of potential, and may offer precisely the kind of life-line&nbsp;Android wearables need.</p>
