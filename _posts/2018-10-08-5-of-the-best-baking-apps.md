<p>With Great British Bake Off 2018 well underway, you may be thinking about flexing your culinary muscles.</p>
<p>Of course, unless you&rsquo;re already a pro (in which case, congrats!), you might need some help along the way. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s take a moment to look at some of the best baking apps you can get on your smartphone or tablet. On your marks, get set, bake!</p>

<h2>1) The Great British Bake Off App</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re completely addicted to the show, here&rsquo;s the official app for you. The Great British Bake Off (GBBO) app is jam-packed with everything you need to boost your game.</p>
<p>Aside from some free recipes, there&rsquo;s also a full baker&rsquo;s guide which will give you all the advice you need to perfect each and every cake. Plus, extra features include a timer, a shopping list, and lots of news from the show.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19111" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WQkjNKmP62AVPowC4YdntIfN5oEW7XXjL9sYoZhIA-iGbrL7EINajqCrmXKcVdfjxMKrlBHYHaafW2EBO7UZCIZC=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Download the app for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.loveproductions.bakeoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> | iOS.</p>
<h2>2) Yummly App</h2>
<p>While Yummly covers a range of recipes (not just bakes!), it&rsquo;s ideal for any newbie baking. The intuitive interface means that it&rsquo;s super simple to find just about whatever you want on the app and start cooking immediately.</p>
<p>One of the major benefits of this app is that, the more you use it, the more it personalises your entire experience. You can even get recommended recipes that are based on the things you&rsquo;ve baked before.</p>

<p>Download the app for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yummly.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> | <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yummly-recipes-grocery-shopping/id589625334?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</p>
<h2>3) Artisan Bread Maker App</h2>
<p>Forget cakes &ndash; what about bread?! If you <em>love</em> bread week on GBBO, here&rsquo;s an app that will help you unleash your inner Paul Hollywood.</p>
<p>Unlike other baking apps, this one contains no recipes (yes, you read that right!). Instead, it&rsquo;s a baking log where you can record all your successful or unsuccessful baking attempts in minute detail.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19110" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ICC5WVhhb_SY-et5Fsp0Gj9s6Wszj2TeJGFKuiCqjFeoZOKMMfDE5HJtiAFaZmKtd6PraPXkGR2b1GKY3x4y09Y=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Download the app for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artisan-bread-maker/id657247840?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</p>
<h2>4) Tasty App</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with Tasty videos (if not, how on earth do you pass your evenings?!).</p>
<p>Buzzfeed&rsquo;s food channel is one of the most popular online and it&rsquo;s clear to see why. Each video has an easy-to-follow recipe that you can copy in mere minutes. Well, did you know that there was an app too? The app boasts a range of recipes &ndash; including a full &lsquo;Bakery Goods&rsquo; section &ndash; that you can access at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Download the app for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzfeed.tasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> | <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tasty/id1217456898?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</p>

<h2>5)&nbsp;Substitutions App</h2>
<p>Gluten intolerance? Nut allergies? Food-induced migraines? If you have any dietary requirements, finding the right baking recipe can be a real trial. That&rsquo;s where the Substitutions app comes into play.</p>
<p>If a certain recipe has an ingredient you can&rsquo;t handle, just search for it in the app and get some recommended swaps. For example, for a gluten-free cake, you could use cassava flour rather than regular flour.</p>
<p>Download the app for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/substitutions/id372387251?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</p>
