<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Technology that not only matches the competition, but in some ways bests it.</span></p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s flagships are coming thick and fast; we have Samsung and the Galaxy S7 range, HTC with the latest 10 model, and, of course, LG with a new G series handset.</p>
<p>The problem consumers face is that top tier smartphones offer something very similar to the next, leaving them faced with that awkward realisation of not really knowing which one to go for.</p>
<p>Well, LG has decided that 2016 is the year to ease our minds and create something that is both different <em>and</em> very promising.</p>
<p>Introducing LG G5, the first mainstream modular smartphone&hellip;</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>LG G5 is a departure from the usual design for the Korean giant, complete with rounded edges, an all-metal build and no visible antenna lines, which all combine to create a smooth and sleek handset that offers the user a real premium smartphone experience.</p>
<p>The rear of the phone is home to a unique dual camera setup and fingerprint reader, which also serves as a physical power key.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10619" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/LG-G5-Design-1.jpg" alt="LG G5 Design" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>The front of the handset sports a stunning 5.3-inch QHD Quantum IPS display, with a PPI of 554 and always-on technology, so the time and your notifications are readily available at a glance.</p>
<p>This stunning display is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 and features a unique curve at the top of the handset that LG has dubbed &lsquo;3D Arc&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10623" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/LG-G5-Display-e1466521039789.jpg" alt="LG G5 Display" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>The bottom of the handset is where LG houses its trump card&hellip; in that it can be ejected and replaced with modules.</p>
<h2>Modular Technology</h2>
<p>The modular element of the G5 is where LG&rsquo;s flagship trumps the competition; press a button on the side of the handset and the base pops out. This allows users to either slap in a fresh battery or upgrade the hardware by adding additional modules, which LG call &lsquo;Friends&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These extra bits of kit give you the option to turn your device into something a little bit more special. At present, LG has two available, the first being a Cam Plus grip that adds extra power, physical buttons, improved grip and a better overall camera UX.</p>

<p>The other module is one created in partnership with B&amp;O &ndash; the experts in audio manufacturing. This mod features a built in 32bit DAC, ultimately resulting in an amazing audio experience from the G5.</p>

<p>More are due in the near-future and with the creativity of the human mind, who knows what fantastic products are in store for LG G5.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Inside the device is this year&rsquo;s current crop of top flight hardware, all powered by a cutting edge Snapdragon 820 processor, coupled with 4GB RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU.</p>
<p>All that grunt means that LG G5 flies through tasks, apps and web browsing without batting an eyelid. With the extra graphical prowess, the G5 is a multimedia monster, demanding console-quality games run buttery-smooth, videos render and play without a hitch, and VR content is a dream come true.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s 32GB of built-in storage for all your content, as well as the option to upgrade by 200GB through a microSD card.</p>
<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>The rear of the handset features a unique dual-camera set-up, offering the user an incredible range of photography options. LG has always been known for producing high-quality snappers on its devices, but the two rear-facing units found on the G5 really take a step beyond.</p>
<p>The main camera consists of a 16-megapixel lens that features laser auto focus, HDR, flash and OIS, meaning the camera is capable of taking amazing shots in all lighting conditions, is super quick, and even supports RAW format for those who like to edit their photos to extreme lengths.</p>
<p>The second rear-facing shooter is an 8-megapixel unit that features an ultra-wide angle lens, offering a 135 degree field of vison&hellip; simply put, it allows you to take incredible shots that contain more of the area you&rsquo;re shooting. Or squeeze more of your friends into shot.</p>

<p>The G5 also has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, perfect for your cheeky selfies.</p>
<p>LG has worked hard on providing a wide range of photographing options, including Manual, Auto, Pop Out and Multiview, the last of which makes use of all three cameras to create a truly unique image.</p>
<p>In addition, LG G5&rsquo;s also capable of capturing 4K UHD video, as well as slow-mo and time lapse footage.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>On top of all LG G5&rsquo;s headline features, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that it supports USB Type-C, which allows for fast charging and also makes life a little easier when plugging in, since it fits either way up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a built-in IR blaster for remote control options. And, of course, everything on LG G5 runs perfectly thanks to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with LG UX 5.0 on top.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>So there you have it, beautiful, powerful and unique; LG has created a stunning piece of technology that not only matches the competition, but in some ways bests it.</p>
<p>Will LG G5&rsquo;s modular format pave the way for a <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/plug-and-play-modular-technology-is-here-to-stay">new generation of smartphones</a>? Only time will tell. One thing is for certain, though, and that&rsquo;s this is an amazing device that offers the user a lot of, well, everything.</p>
<p><strong>Now, nothing quite says 'modular mobile phones' like Jason Statham's head superimposed on a new-born baby's body.</strong></p>
