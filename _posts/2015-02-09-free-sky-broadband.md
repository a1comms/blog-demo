There aren&rsquo;t any catches or long-term contracts involved. And the offer&rsquo;s even available without Sky TV.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t have to worry about exceeding your broadband limit during your contract, since there aren&rsquo;t any caps. Plus with a free Alcatel 7-inch tablet, you&rsquo;ll have the perfect device for streaming movies and browsing the Web to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>As part of the package, you&rsquo;ll get inclusive weekend calls to UK landlines, with Sky Talk Weekends.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the transition. It&rsquo;s really straightforward to switch over to Sky Broadband, especially with Sky&rsquo;s dedicated Switch Squad at hand.</p>
<p>A monthly line rental fee of &pound;16.40 applies, to cover the cost of your landline calls. And there&rsquo;s a one-off charge of &pound;6.95 for the router delivery, to get you started.</p>
