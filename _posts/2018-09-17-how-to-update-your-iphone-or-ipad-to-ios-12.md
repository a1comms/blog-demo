<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The update comes out today!</span></p>
<p>It might be Monday, but here&rsquo;s something to get you over those start-of-the-week blues. The latest iOS update is released today! Yes, by the end of the day, you will be able to give your Apple device a small makeover. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect from iOS 12:</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The main way that iOS 12 will improve your device is by giving you a serious improvement when it comes to performance. Every aspect of your phone or iPad should work faster than before. What&rsquo;s more, you should find that it&rsquo;s all more efficient too.</p>
<h2>Group FaceTime</h2>
<p>We all know that FaceTime is a simple way to stay in touch with your nearest and dearest. Until now, you could only chat one-on-one with other Apple users. However, the latest iOS 12 update will mean that you can host group FaceTime chats. Nice.</p>

<h2>Improved Siri</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s signature AI is getting some new skills with the latest update. Third-party apps will be able to integrate with the system and use it. This could mean that you can do more things with Siri than ever before.</p>
<h2>Better Notifications</h2>
<p>Having a thousand new notifications on your iPhone can be&hellip; stressful. If you get anxiety pangs when you look at your device, you might love the changes that iOS 12 will bring your way.</p>
<p>The grouped notification feature means that you will see your alerts as a stack and can dismiss them all at once. Plus, you can choose &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; notifications so that they bug you just a little less too.</p>
<h2>Screen Time App</h2>
<p>Worried about using your phone too much? Aren&rsquo;t we all. This brand new app will help you with that problem. It will tell you how much time you&rsquo;re spending on certain apps and break them down by category too. The idea is that it should help you strike a better balance between screen time and real life time!</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, if you already have iOS 11, you should be able to update to iOS 12. While Apple does not support updates on some of its older devices, most of the modern ones (that have been released in the last few years) should be fine!</p>
<h2>How to Update Your iPhone or iPad</h2>
<p>Ready to give your iPhone or iPad a quick update? It&rsquo;s pretty darn simple. As always, you need you make sure that you&rsquo;ve backed up your device, it has enough battery left and that you are connected to a secure WiFi service.</p>
<p>Next, go to <em>Settings > General > Software Update</em>. If the iOS update is already available for your device, you will see it there.</p>
<p>You will also get a quick rundown of how large the update is and what you can expect from it. Simply click &lsquo;Download&rsquo; and wait for the magic to happen (of course, since it&rsquo;s a new update, it may take a short while to download).</p>
