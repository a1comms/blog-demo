<p><span class="postStandFirst">Motorola has been fairly quiet recently, and releases here in the UK have been few and far between, or so it seems, compared to other manufacturer&rsquo;s recent activity. It is a surprise that there is no real headline release scheduled just before Christmas, however, has Motorola surprised us all with the Motorola Moto G?</span></p>
<p>After months of leaks and rumours, the Moto G has finally been released in the UK &ndash; just in time for the Christmas rush, which on the face of it seems a great strategy by Motorola. With a crisp 720p HD display of 4.5 inches, quad-core processor and a 5 megapixel camera, the Moto G seems like a tidy proposition, however the real killer punch is the price.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5782" alt="10840323125_5fab189392" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/10840323125_5fab189392.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p>A quad-core processor and HD display often warrant hefty price tags, however the Motorola G will cost you less than &pound;150 for an 8GB version, which seems like a real bargain. The Moto G will come running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean straight out of the box, and despite not being the latest Android OS, as Google now owns Motorola, the Moto G will be one of the first devices to be able to download Android 4.4 KitKat very soon!</p>
<p><strong>Users will also be able to customise their Moto G with different coloured back panels which will be sold separately. With Christmas being an expensive time of year, Motorola seems to be on a winner with the Moto G!</strong></p>
