<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">From the explosion of bitcoin, to the launch of iPhone X. And many more.</span></p>
<p>The end of 2017 is nigh, but what have we learned this year? Let&rsquo;s look back at some of the biggest tech stories to find out.</p>
<h2>January</h2>
<p><strong>Netflix:</strong> The start of 2017 was a good time for the people over at Netflix. The streaming company saw its <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/netflix-2016-earnings-revenue-original-shows">profits rise</a> by more than 50%. It also went ahead and announced that it would be spending millions on new original content in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Russia:</strong> US intelligence said that <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/06/politics/intelligence-report-putin-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian hackers</a> got hold of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s email account. The theory was that the state was attempting to interfere with the presidential election.</p>
<h2>February</h2>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> What&rsquo;s the future of Facebook? Well, AI, probably. Back in February, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg released an essay</a> saying that the company would be focussing on the tech in coming years.</p>

<p><strong>Uber:</strong> Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, called the company out on sexism. She wrote a <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> describing her point in full detail.</p>
<h2>March</h2>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> The much-awaited Switch was released. By September, the games company had sold more than 7 million units. It exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Snapchat:</strong> The company finally went public. The overall value of the social media firm was placed at $19.7 billion. Cha-ching!</p>
<h2>April</h2>

<p><strong>Russia:</strong> Facebook <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/facebook-report-government-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Russia hijacked its platform to attempt to influence the 2016 election. In response to this, the social media site closed thousands of fake Russian accounts.</p>
<h2>May</h2>
<p><strong>EU:</strong> The EU fined both <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-whatsapp-fine-european-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/27/google-braces-for-record-breaking-1bn-fine-from-eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> in May. Google was fined based on its search engine results, and Facebook was fined for its WhatsApp takeover.</p>
<p><strong>NHS:</strong> The NHS was in trouble after the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/ransomware-meltdown-experts-warned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WannaCry ransomware attack</a>. Since the news story broke, North Korea has been blamed for it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16049" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/miVmRXQ83muefn-9z7tf4lZlhO4CGJJpeMJcFUIeS8YDmhBqF1-7S2qpP9fiqfEVGPIl5WCf-T1vYV6cP7jgiY6c=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>June</h2>
<p><strong>Uber:</strong> Travis Kalanick, Uber&rsquo;s founder, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40351859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a> from the company after months of scandals leading up to the move.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear fusion:</strong> Scientists <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/nuclear-fusion-closer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made real progress</a> in the realms of nuclear fusion. The move may mean that we can create fusion energy on earth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16050" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XPYNpbh-Z803HBz87C6eXoRa3sodQFhAEfV2yu4PIDNAaHTE5s55TCvAB3u9tSxq-NAyt2VI7BAtrdS-C3WnipuW=s0" alt="" /></p>

The new tech would be a real leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Bikes:</strong> oBike, a Singapore based startup, said that they would be offering their services throughout London. The new <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/london-obike-dockless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bikes-for-hire scheme</a> uses tracking technology instead of physical docks for the vehicles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16051" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W56emYDvuA2dYPxLf9qj95YP_EqwqBTCQefI_ehqcXkPYCYqBeNfygCrU4OMCksGXRyKOCabBYYfMviYbuuOtCY_VQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>August</h2>
<p><strong>Robots:</strong> Ethical hackers took over cute robots to turn them into stabbers. The hackers were able to take over the Nao, Pepper, and Alpha robots and control their actions.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9A4ZQgzfl0Y" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

The reason, he said, was that women have an inferior brain. Ouch.</p>
<h2>September</h2>

<p><strong>Uber:</strong> Uber&rsquo;s licence to operate in London was revoked. The reason given at the time was a lack of corporate responsibility on the part of the ride sharing app.</p>
<h2>October</h2>
<p><strong>Yahoo:</strong> The company admitted that there had been a <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/hacks-data-breaches-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major data breach</a>. They said that three billion accounts had been successfully accessed by hackers.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> After the horrendous Las Vegas shooting, trolls used Twitter to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-trolls-las-vegas-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spread fake news</a> about the event. It was the latest in a series of events in which trolls have used online platforms to spread lies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16052" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l7oMmfrpi8rNjjoZ1z9WR-CQMKjzxMZTjPvP6CrDTv7Fpq3xXtUuheZaP0MuW4z4xzT9jwwDIHuzaJJemczkXJg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>November</h2>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong>&nbsp;iPhone X finally came out. It has been rated as <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-x-review-a-radical-new-look-for-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best iPhone of all time</a>, and marks a radical change for not only Apple&rsquo;s smartphones, but the industry too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bs_AQejjL-g1UzUTaHa8pVnh_JlfDkGp969l2FVyfaflS2O3x0bmHi2-QsJuz347Wb5GS7pe_5Kc5IhxnkNdtUTr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Russia:</strong> Evidence came out to suggest that Russian hackers used Twitter to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/brexit-russia-influence-twitter-bots-internet-research-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influence the results of Brexit</a>. The theory is that they used racist language to alter public opinion.</p>
<h2>December</h2>
<p><strong>Net neutrality:</strong> Surprisingly, the Federal Communications Commission voted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/14/16774148/net-neutrality-repeal-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end net neutrality</a>. This came after much support from the public for keeping it.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> The cryptocurrency rose 17-fold toward the end of the year. The surge in the value of <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/will-bitcoin-bubble-burst-or-crash-2017-psychology-cryptocurrency-economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin hit $20,000</a> during December.</p>
