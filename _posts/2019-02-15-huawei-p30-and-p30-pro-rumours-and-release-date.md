<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">How can Huawei best its 2018 devices?!</span></p>
<p>The rumour mill has been churning and this time it&rsquo;s about the next Huawei series.</p>
<p>With Huawei taking the mobile phone market by storm in 2018, it will be interesting to see how it betters it&rsquo;s P20 family and Mate 20 series devices in 2019.</p>
<p>The rumoured P30 handsets could well make an appearance in the first half on 2019, here&rsquo;s what we know from around the web.</p>
<p>Before we start, check out this video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC09L_iJkMVxabXrPz4I0sSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concept Creator</a>&nbsp;and his little tease of a Huawei P30 series concept&hellip;</p>

<h2>Huawei P30: Design and Display</h2>
<p>So, what will the next devices look like? Well, according to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-huawei-p30-renders-show-off-teardrop-notch-triple-lens-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRadar</a> on images sourced via 91mobiles.com, the leaks show the Huawei P30 with a teardrop notch, triple lens camera and an almost all-screen look.</p>
<p>In some of the latest leaks showcased on the site Spigen, smartphone accessory manufacturer, released a set of new case images for the proposed devices, giving us a pretty clear indication of how the Huawei&rsquo;s could look.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20103" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K0YwQyj9qaNJq-XV16OdsykOp7PVCQaDMgW1KNeMr2waJpVFMwV8ZDYUASnTnhzWM0v0dt_McOtZoAO1S8hfDGUC=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to the source, we could see a 6.5-inch screen on the Huawei P30 Pro with an LCD display, and the P30 device could have a 6.1-inch screen. A hefty step up in size on both counts from the previous P20 devices.</p>
<p>Based on these leaked images, it&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll also see a continuation of Huawei&rsquo;s beautiful two-tone colour patterns as seen on previous devices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20100" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cnHS2RQ0MWJjCpVDE49-x5aF9jSIPj5SJWrr6NO30RTPnKlXxF9IWhSUPPDNa0a0AhpZT4Eld4TCuQsl5khzoy_QNQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Huawei P30: Cameras</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/huawei-p30-pro-design-leaked-case-image-spigen-march-28-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">91.mobiles.com</a>, we could see a camera make-up similar to that of the P20 Pro device, with a 40-megapixel, 20-megapixel and 8-megapixel lens with 3x optical zoom on the new P30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the P30 Pro device, we could well see a new quad-lens camera setup from the Chinese mega-band. Another step up from last year's devices, sporting twin and triple lens numbers.</p>
<p>According to TechRadar, the P30 could well come with a 10x optical zoom capability, which would greatly enhance your phone photography skills even more!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that along with camera upgrades, we will see more modes, features and photography tricks that&rsquo;ll come built-in. But for all that, we&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see what Huawei has up its sleeve.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20101" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_6ElPGKT04CVbN5gFujnWjj9aA_HQrW-w0kyEYUAPRSdMqT06BzA2pTnAJKrToa-b_cDkM7ku7OaSdYC4OOXnEQb=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Huawei P30: Features and Specifications</h2>
<p>Without any sign of fingerprint scanners on the back of these leaks, we could assume that the new P30 devices could have in-screen fingerprint scanners. This would free up space on the back of the device for other internal mechanics.</p>
<p>According to 91mobiles.com, we could well see up to 12GB RAM on one of the P30 devices, which would no doubt shake things up a bit when it comes to mobile entertainment and gaming. Not to mention a new Kirin processor which could well be on the way with advancements on its 2018 version.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20104" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lnuVi2kKYqq_AsZ-ksaA-PQFZJmaXmxbTceGt35VH80xXnJpPskamJyyPLHgBZlhm1ZatyYV5VljZ5N1Bag1tEur=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>What about my music? Well, TechRadar rumours suggest we could be seeing a headphone jack again, in the format of a USB-C-to-3.5mm. Similar to what's on the&nbsp;Mate 20 device&nbsp;launched last year, this could be a win for on-the-go mobile listeners.</p>
<p>As seen on <a href="https://www.t3.com/features/huawei-p30-huawei-p30-pro-leaks-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T3</a>, it&rsquo;s likely that Huawei will try and up its game in the animated emoji arena too. So, watch out, its EMUI operating system could well come with some snazzy new features.</p>
<p>All aboard the 5G train! T3 also elaborates on Huawei&rsquo;s 5G aspirations, making reference to the fact that we may well see one of these new devices with 5G compatibility.</p>
<h2>Huawei P30: Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>With Mobile World Congress not too far away (taking place between 25th to 28th February), this is where it was initially thought the P30 family would be announced.</p>
<p>However, Huawei recently teased us with a press invite taking place on the eve of Mobile World Congress. A new move from the tech giant, but what could they be wanting to talk about?</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_20009" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/huawei-teases-foldable-mobile-with-event-invite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-20009" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T6Uzjb9kHPKA5rj5nhuls1gmsEkf7ZzupAkG5IMS-x8hUTpQ-UXLkXVvD7o6mrTC4Rbydr8z_HairlJ4JvpGR38=s0" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></a> READ: Huawei teases foldable mobile with event invite[/caption]</p>
<p>Huawei has its next big event scheduled for the end of March, which would follow suit with its previous March device releases. According to <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/huawei/146589-huawei-p30-and-p30-pro-release-date-features-news-price-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket-lint</a>, the Paris event date was leaked via a Polish press release and may well be the P30 family announcement event.</p>
<p>Based on Huawei&rsquo;s P20 release, it&rsquo;s likely the Pro version will cost more than its counterpart, often having more features. We can also expect the new devices will cost more than the previous years (<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Pro &pound;599</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20 &pound;449.00</a>).</p>
