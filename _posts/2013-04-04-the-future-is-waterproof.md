<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Sony Xperia Z's innovative waterproofing may just have paved the way for future smartphone iterations. Let's face it, we've been waiting for this sort of feature for a long time...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4732 aligncenter" alt="Sony Xperia Z" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Sony-Xperia-Z.jpg" width="800" height="743" /></p>
<p>The&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z, as everyone already knows by now, is one of the strongest contenders for Android phone of the year, alongside the other two big hitters that were recently unveiled, the&nbsp;HTC One&nbsp;and the highly anticipated&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4. Each of those three phones has a certain &lsquo;uniqueness&rsquo; about it, a feature that helps to elevate it above the pack.</p>
<p>With the HTC One, it&rsquo;s the unique UltraPixel camera. With the Samsung Galaxy S4, it&rsquo;s the completely unique suite of software, such as the facial recognition utilising Smart Scroll. With the Sony Xperia Z, however, is a feature that many are saying will become commonplace in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the Sony Xperia Z, in addition to being powerful and gorgeous, is&nbsp;<em>water-resistant</em>.</p>
<p>The history of waterproof smartphones has been a spotty affair so far, for the simple reason that most waterproof smartphones have been of the &ldquo;tough phone&rdquo; variety, and hence have been built with toughness in mind, instead of high-end power and features. As a result, these phones (from the likes of Sonim) while being relentlessly hard to damage, were also somewhat underpowered. The other problem was that they weren&rsquo;t exactly what could ever be called &lsquo;slim&rsquo;, which was fine because those phones served a particular market.</p>
<p>The same bulkiness, though, while perfectly fitting&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;market, meant that they never really entered the mainstream in the way that top-end phones by HTC or Samsung did.</p>
<p>The first real attempt to rectify this came in the shape of a phone made the now Google-owned Motorola, and that phone was the Motorola Defy. It was certainly a step in the right direction, with a more svelte body, but it still had a certain bulkiness to it. The Sony Xperia Z, however, manages to be water-resistant while still only being 7.9mm thick, and as such, it really is a miracle of modern engineering.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the Sony Xperia Z is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>New technologies are being delivered to market all the time, and one of the coolest is nanocoating, a process that can even be done by third parties to&nbsp;<em>existing</em>&nbsp;smartphones, today. The most well-known company offering this service is Liquipel, and the process essentially involves using plasma to coat every surface of a device, inside and out, with a nano-scale hydrophobic layer. The end result is a smartphone that&rsquo;s no thicker than the modern superphones we&rsquo;ve all come to love, but which water doesn&rsquo;t affect in the slightest!</p>
<p>Many people are predicting that when this gets into the hands of manufacturers, it will become second nature for them to waterproof their phones. Perhaps, then, the real importance of the Sony Xperia Z is not because of its processor, or its gorgeous 1080p screen.</p>
<p><strong>A super-fast processor and a gorgeous screen are simply an evolution of what&rsquo;s come before; perhaps the&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;importance of the Sony Xperia Z is the fact that it&rsquo;s ushering in a whole new era of waterproof phones!</strong></p>
