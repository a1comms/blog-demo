<p><span class="postStandFirst">Not content with capturing headlines by merely announcing the Samsung Galaxy S5, Korean manufacturer Samsung has gone one step further, in its quest to get the world hyped about their new phone with the ultimate Oscars selfie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5851 aligncenter" alt="Oscar Selfie" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Oscars-selfie-009-1024x614.jpg" width="960" height="575" /><span class="caption">Image: an all-star lineup including the likes of&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Channing Tatum, Kevin Spacey,&nbsp;Bradley&nbsp;Cooper, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.</span></p>
<p>Yes, it seems that TV presenter Ellen DeGeneres went round the Oscars, grabbing selfies with a&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and uploading them to her Twitter feed.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/statuses/440322224407314432">One particular Tweet</a>&nbsp;seemed to take on a life of its own, as well, as it has officially gone on to become the most retweeted Tweet&nbsp;<em>ever</em>!</p>
<p>In a world obsessed with celebrity, though, that&rsquo;s hardly surprising, when you consider that the Tweet in question was a photo with Bradley Cooper in it. And Jennifer Lawrence (who fell over her dress,&nbsp;<em>again</em>, bless her). Oh, and Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. Oh yes, and roughly 38% of Jared Leto&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5854 aligncenter" alt="Oscar Selfie" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Oscar-Selfie.jpg" width="749" height="421" /></p>
<p>As is so often the case, though, Kevin Spacey stole the show, since he appears to be photobombiing everyone else...</p>
<p>Naturally, Nokia jumped in on the action (as they tend to do in these situations, brilliantly), sharing a blurry photo of Ellen, and hinting at the idea that she should have used a Nokia Lumia 1020. Still, this is one heck of a marketing victory for Samsung.</p>
<p><strong>Given how many phones Samsung&nbsp;<em>already</em>&nbsp;sells per day, we dread to think how many&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;they might sell off the back of this. In hindsight, things like this are probably why Samsung is the biggest phone manufacturer in the entire world...</strong></p>
