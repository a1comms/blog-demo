<p><span class="postStandFirst">For a long time, there have been rumours that Apple is working on its first smartwatch. According to a new rumour, the Apple iWatch may not just be one, but actually two separate smart watches - one of which will carry a price of thousands of US dollars, although there&rsquo;s no indication yet as to whether they will be Bluetooth accessories (like the Galaxy Gear, which needs to be linked to a Samsung smartphone) or standalone devices like those watches which use Android Wear.</span></p>
<p>After the unveiling of Android Wear, smartwatches have a <em>lot</em> more likely to enter the mainstream consciousness. Most manufacturers have smartwatches on the drawing board, from HTC to Nokia, and now, we&rsquo;ve heard rumours about what the Apple iWatch will be like<strong>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/13845135975_ac23f1af48.jpg" width="427" height="500" /></strong></p>
<p>Specifically, according to MacRumours, it might not be just <em>one</em> smartwatch.</p>
<p>They are reporting on a prediction made by Ming Chi Kuo, analyst for KGI Securities, who says that Apple will actually release two smartwatches, one sized at 1.3 inches, the other at 1.5 inches, to accommodate different sizes of wrist. However, both Apple iWatches will, allegedly, feature a &ldquo;fashionable appearance&rdquo;, and a slim, light design.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether the first two iWatches will need to be linked up to a phone to actually work (as with the Samsung Galaxy Gear, which links up to phones like the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>), or whether they will be will be standalone devices. The latter would be preferable; as we&rsquo;ve said before, standalone smartwatches are vastly more compelling than what some have called glorified Bluetooth accessories.</p>
<p>This is why smartwatches running on Android Wear look so much more promising than previous-gen smartwatches, and why we hope HTC&rsquo;s upcoming offering won&rsquo;t need to be linked up to the HTC One M8 to work (because as fantastic as the One M8 is, it slightly defeats the point of a smartwatch if you have to link it to this admittedly brilliant phone).</p>
<p>As for price, expect the Apple iWatch, or iWatches, to be expensive; Kuo says that the top-end model will cost &ldquo;several thousand US dollars&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>As always, take these rumours with a pinch of salt until official information is forthcoming from Apple. And as we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this, stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
