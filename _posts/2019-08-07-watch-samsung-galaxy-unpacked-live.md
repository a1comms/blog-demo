<h2>What is the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard anything about the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event before now, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. We&rsquo;ve got you covered.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The frequent event is a chance for the people behind Samsung to share what it&rsquo;s been working on with the world. That means that we get a sneak preview of the new tech that the company will be rolling out in the coming months.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back in February 2019 at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/all-the-incredible-highlights-from-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2019" target="_blank">last Unpacked event</a>, we were treated to announcements for the Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus and S10e. It didn&rsquo;t end there. We also got a glimpse of the Galaxy Fold, the Galaxy Buds and a couple of the brand&rsquo;s wearable devices too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Unpacked event is<br />
usually a chance for the brand leaders to unveil more than a few devices and<br />
showcase their best features. Oh, and you can expect key guest speakers to<br />
boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What Can We Expect at Unpacked 2019?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> Of course, the officials at Samsung are keeping their plans under their figurative hats &ndash; for now. With the event just a day away, all we can do is speculate on what&rsquo;s to come. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But perhaps we can find a clue or two in the invitation to the event. The clip shows an S-Pen drawing around the eye of a camera lens. Curiouser and curiouser. Watch it here:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TzMnJhgwww","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The stylus in the video tells us that we could see a new Note smartphone. One report from <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-to-expect-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Digital Trends</a> suggests that there may also be multiple versions!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The camera game on these devices is certain to be strong too. There&rsquo;s a reason that a lens is featured as a part of the invitation video. Rumours have been rife about a possible triple-lens setup, although nothing has been confirmed by the company yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unpacked-2019-08-live-streaming/" target="_blank">Samsung Newsroom</a>, there&rsquo;s a snippet that says the event will &ldquo;unveil new devices designed to take the Galaxy ecosystem&rsquo;s connectivity to the next level.&rdquo; Since, at the last event, the company also announced extra gadgets such as earphones and wearable tech, we can surely expect more updates in these areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly an<br />
exciting time to be a tech fan&hellip; Tune in today for the full lowdown.</p>
