<p><span class="postStandFirst">The NOKIA Lumia 920 is the Finnish mobile phone giant&rsquo;s latest flagship, a true powerhouse and frontrunner of the Windows Phone 8 platform.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5484 aligncenter" alt="Nokia Lumia 920" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/nokia-lumia-920-xl.jpg" width="960" height="640" /></p>
<p>The&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 920&nbsp;is an impressive device, offering class leading technology and sporting a very unique design of a single-shelled polycarbonate unibody.</p>
<p>The spec sheet for the Nokia Lumia 920 is fantastic - it sports a 4.5 inch Puremotion HD+ display with 332ppi which offers excellent viewing angles and even allows you to operate the phone when wearing gloves. The Lumia 920 packs an 8.7 megapixel camera with PureView technology and OIS (Optical Image Stabalisation) coupled with Carl Zeiss optics allowing for amazing photos.</p>
<p>The Nokia flagship also ships with NFC, 4G connectivity and wireless charging, a technology that allows you to place your device on a compatible charging matt or plate and charges without the use of wires.</p>
<p>The Nokia Lumia 920 is powered by a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor which, complete with the amazingly smooth and functional Windows Phone 8 platform, offers a fantastic smartphone experience.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 offers plenty of functionality including thousands of apps through Windows Marketplace but it is through Nokia's exclusive apps, the Lumia 920 really steps forward.</p>
<p>Nokia has offered a great variety of exclusives including the fantastic Nokia Drive which gives the user free turn by turn voice guided navigation and even works without data. Other app highlights include Nokia city lens, which works through your cameras viewfinder and springs information to the screen about local information, attractions and restaurants.</p>
<p>The Nokia Lumia 920's real jewel in the crown with app exclusives has to be Nokia Music. This application allows the user to stream unlimited music for free, via mix radio which has thousands of created playlists which stream through your phone via 3G/4G or WiFi.</p>
<p>The beauty of Nokia music is the simplicity and sheer volume of tracks available these can be purchased and stored on the huge 32GB of internal memory on-board the Lumia 920, Noika Music also allows you to search the latest gigs and even tracks gigs that are happening in your area.</p>
<p>All this functionality and choice coupled with no sign up and DOLBY audio (device dependant) equal to one of the best audio experiences out there.</p>
<p><strong>The Lumia 920 is one of the best handsets out there, it&rsquo;s got the looks, the specs and the software, add apps like NOKIA Music and NOKIA Drive and you&rsquo;re looking at a real flagship and current champion of the Windows Phone 8 handsets.</strong></p>
