<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade, don&rsquo;t call the network or walk into any old high-street retailer. Instead, read this and upgrade your mobile phone the right way.</span></p>
<p>Upgrading your mobile phone might seem like puzzling experience. You might ask yourself, &ldquo;Do I need to cancel my current contract first?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I keep my mobile number?&rdquo; &ldquo;Will I get a better deal as an existing customer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are all perfectly valid questions, to which we will provide the answers. The aim of this &lsquo;How To Upgrade&rsquo; article is to ensure you come away feeling confident and fully equipped when you come to upgrade your mobile phone.</p>
<h2>First thing&rsquo;s first</h2>
<p>Before you start shopping for upgrade deals, you should check whether you&rsquo;re eligible to upgrade. This is usually 45 days before the end of your contract, if you&rsquo;re on Orange, T-Mobile or EE.</p>
<p>There are two really simple and convenient ways to check your eligibility;</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete our <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/upgrade" target="_blank">online eligibility checker</a></li>
<li>Call us on 0345 413 6262 (<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/upgrade" target="_blank">see opening times</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Early upgrades</h2>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not yet eligible, you can pay a small fee to upgrade early and get the deal you want, when you want it. Boom! All you have to do is call 0345 413 6262.</p>
<h2>Already ready to upgrade</h2>
<p>If you already know you&rsquo;re in your upgrade period, then you can start looking through our fantastic deals. Once you find the one you want, just click &lsquo;Buy Now&rsquo; and complete the checkout process. Working with the network, we&rsquo;ll complete the rest, connecting you to your new tariff, migrating your existing number across and shipping your new smartphone.</p>
<h2>The benefits of upgrading with Buymobiles.net</h2>
<p>Instead of going to the network or other vendors, you should choose Buymobiles.net. Here are four reasons why&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Our prices often beat the network, so it can cheaper to upgrade with us.</li>
<li>Order up to 8PM for free, next-delivery, and talk to our experts at a time that suits you.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll migrate the mobile number you know and love to your upgrade deal.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t credit check you when you order one of our upgrades, so no mark against your file.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The perks of being an existing Buymobiles.net customer</h2>
<p>Whilst we love our new customers, we take extra special care of our existing ones. So much so, that we ensure you get a few exclusive benefits when you come back to us.</p>
<ol>

<li>Priority processing means you get your upgrade quickly and hassle free, ahead of everyone else.</li>
<li>Exclusive offers reserved for existing customers means you get the very best deals on the market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to do with your old mobile</h2>
<p>Once you get your hands on a shiny new mobile, there are a couple of things you can do with your old one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up a <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sim-only" target="_blank">SIM only deal</a> and insert it into your old device. You can use it as a spare, or give it to a family member. It could be the perfect way to stay in touch with your children or grandparents, without spending much at all.</li>
<li>Recycle your old smartphone and get up to &pound;480. The extra cash will help offset the cost of your new upgrade deal, or it could go towards something completely different.</li>
</ol>
