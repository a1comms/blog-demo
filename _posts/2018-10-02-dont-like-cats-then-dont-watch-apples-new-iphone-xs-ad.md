<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&lsquo;Everything you love just got bigger.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the world. You&rsquo;ve got your normal people; the ones who unashamedly love everything feline and are darn proud of it.</p>
<p>Then there are the oddballs who claim not to like kitties and say things like &ldquo;Cats are so selfish&rdquo; while pulling self-righteous faces and sipping their chai lattes.</p>
<p>If you fall into the latter category, we can&rsquo;t be friends, obviously. Plus, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t bother watching Apple&rsquo;s new advert.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have a beating heart, you are sure to love the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a> commercial entitled &lsquo;Growth Spurt.&rsquo; It features a cat in a big way.</p>
<p><em>Bonus: Research published in the Computers in Human Behaviour Journal suggests that watching cat videos can actually improve your mood and lower your stress levels. So, taking a short break to give this particular clip a whirl is a win-win situation.</em></p>
<h2>iPhone Xs &ndash; Growth Spurt</h2>
<p>The advert starts out with the cutest ginger cat meowing while a woman sits on the couch. She&rsquo;s holding an iPhone Xs and turns to her pet to do what any of us would do in that situation &ndash; take a picture of it. As she does so, though, the cat has a major growth spurt.</p>
<p>She does the same thing with her avocado on toast (because, of course!) and it also grows to a massive size in mere seconds. This is only the start of the commercial and the clip continues in the same vein. Check it out here:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVe__Py2GuU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the advert, we see a whole range of animals and objects get transformed from their regular size to that of a giant. From a dog to a golf ball, it seems that there&rsquo;s no end to the things that can begin to grow and grow.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple isn&rsquo;t saying that your <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a> or iPhone Xs Max will actually have these magical powers. At least, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s not what the advert means, unless I have grossly misunderstood it. Instead, it&rsquo;s a little hat tip to the two phones&rsquo; new retina displays which are the biggest yet. Very clever, Apple. Very clever.</p>
