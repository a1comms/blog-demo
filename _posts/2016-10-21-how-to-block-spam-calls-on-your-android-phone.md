<p><em>Not got an Android? See <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/how-to-block-spam-calls-on-your-iphone">how to block spam calls on your iPhone</a>.</em></p>
<p>There are dozens of possible developments that could ruin your day, from spilling coffee down your crisp white shirt, to realising that you&rsquo;ve left your bank card at home and haven&rsquo;t packed a lunch.</p>
<p>Life is just full of these little 'surprises' that are just bound to make you feel like the world&rsquo;s secretly laughing at your plight&hellip;</p>
<p>In the age of smartphones, one of the most unwelcomed of which, is spam calls.</p>
<p>You know the type; they call you to ask about your apparent unclaimed PPI, much-needed life insurance, and that accident you were recently in. While the dialler on the other end of the line may be painfully polite, we all know that these calls are nothing but a colossal waste of everyone&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could just cut them out of your life entirely?</p>
<p>Well, if you own an Android mobile phone, there isn&rsquo;t just one fail-safe way to prevent spam calls. In fact, there are a multitude of ways to do it. The only issue is the fixes can vary from Android to Android, depending on the manufacturer&hellip; That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve covered the top three, and included some helpful apps for everyone else.</p>
<h2>Samsung users, Say Sayonara to Spammers</h2>
<p>Fortunate for you, Samsung has made it pretty easy to block calls. First, you need to tap the dialler icon then More at the top of the screen, followed by Settings. You&rsquo;ll see a Call Rejection tab there. Once you open it, you&rsquo;ll be able to manage your so-called <em>blocked caller list</em>. Nothing could be easier.</p>

<h2>Show Cold Callers the Hand on Your HTC</h2>
<p>Own an HTC phone? Then you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that it features a built-in call-blocking system that&rsquo;s very easy to use. All you need to do is head into your call history and find the offending number. Simply press and hold on said number for a second or two, and you&rsquo;ll be met with a list of actions, tap Block Contact. Voil&agrave;! That spammer can&rsquo;t call again.</p>

<h2>Let Your LG Intercept Unsolicited Calls</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to block a number on your LG phone, it&rsquo;s much less complex than you may imagine. The process takes less than a minute and means you can say goodbye to all those spam calls. First, go to the dialler app and tap Call Settings, followed by Call Reject then Reject Calls From. Finish by tapping the + icon, where you can add the numbers that have been plaguing you.</p>
