<p><span class="postStandFirst">If we were to make a list of the phones we&rsquo;re most excited about in 2014, the Sony Xperia Z2 would be right up there at the top of the list. A lot of people want to get their hands on one, and soon, you&rsquo;ll be able to, because the Sony Xperia Z2 is available to pre-order now!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/12972354304_c258f0a7fd.jpg" width="500" height="297" /></p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve already made up your mind to get one, now&rsquo;s your chance! If you&rsquo;re still waiting to find out more about the phone, then allow us to explain why this is one of the best phones we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of powerful smartphones over the years, but the Sony Xperia Z2 is&nbsp;<em>easily</em>&nbsp;one of the most powerful. It comes with a 2.3GHz processor, but on top of that, it has 3Gb of RAM, and both of those features combine to make the phone&nbsp;<em>astonishingly</em>&nbsp;fast. It also has a 20.7MP camera, which makes the Xperia Z2&nbsp;<em>versatile</em>; it&rsquo;s as at home being your portable games console, your mobile cinema, and your camera!</p>

<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;about power; in the Sony Xperia Z2, raw power is married to sumptuous looks, with a sleek body and a gorgeous 5.2-inch 1080p screen.</p>
<p>Plus, like its predecessor, it&rsquo;s dust- and water-resistant.</p>
<p>What we have here, then, is a phone that&nbsp;<em>looks</em>&nbsp;mouth-watering, while boasting phenomenal power,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;that can survive an accidental dunking in water, which is frankly, well,&nbsp;<em>astounding</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you&rsquo;re wanting to get hold of what may be one of the best smartphones&nbsp;<em>ever</em>,&nbsp;pre-order the Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;today!</strong></p>
