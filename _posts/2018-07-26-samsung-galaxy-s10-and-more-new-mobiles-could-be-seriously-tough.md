<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Drop them&hellip; We dare you!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a case of the old butter fingers, you will be all-too-familiar with the jolt of fear that comes each time you pick up your phone. The panic is real. Dropping that valuable piece of tech means paying out on your insurance or, even worse, covering the cost yourself. Needless to say, it can be a pretty pricey accident.</p>
<p>With that in mind, most of us protect our smartphones vigilantly with a tough screen protector and a thick case. It&rsquo;s standard protocol. We know the drill. If you don&rsquo;t protect your device, you basically deserve to have it shatter into a thousand tiny pieces when it slips from your hands. But wait&hellip; what if that simply wasn&rsquo;t the case?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18061" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6CILYg05DEF9-z9eWjA8cjYkgByo2HOOiFazrDMvUM-AzFgKx-rZBbTMmIAq4Z-Mn5iMyqoUwa0TDu6IVoVXnvA1=s0" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>A brand new piece of tech &ndash; Gorilla Glass 6 &ndash; could change everything for the better. The material has been dubbed the toughest yet and the manufacturers have done the tests to prove it. Yes, someone had the job of dropping the glass from a height of one metre onto a &lsquo;rough surface.&rsquo; Surprisingly, the tech survived a whopping 15 drops.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, that is about twice as tough as the tech&rsquo;s previous incarnation &ndash;&nbsp;Gorilla Glass 5. It just goes to show that the technology has come a long way in recent years. What&rsquo;s more, some forms of glass composition tech don&rsquo;t even survive the first drop, which could mean worrying things for your smartphone.</p>

<p>So, when can we get our hands on this all-singing, all-dancing new technology? Well, it could be a whole lot sooner than we think. In fact, the Gorilla Glass manufacturers have said that the technology is currently being evaluated by customers, i.e. phone brands. That could mean that we will see smartphones sporting the tech in the near future.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious choices for the glass is the rumoured <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10</a>. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge leap to imagine that the next Samsung smartphone may have this glass as standard. If that&rsquo;s the case, it could be the strongest device of its type. Whether that will happen, only time will tell. One thing&rsquo;s for sure &ndash; we can&rsquo;t wait for stronger phones!</p>
