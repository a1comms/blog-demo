<p>We&rsquo;re drawing ever closer to the biggest event in the mobile industry&rsquo;s calendar. Yes, MWC 2015 is now just two weeks away, and everyone in the industry is working themselves up into a frenzy, as we psych ourselves up to see what our favourite smartphone makers are going to announce next.</p>
<p>So, what rumours have we heard so far? What cool new stuff can we expect to see at MWC 2015?</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>Based on rumours milling about the place, we&rsquo;re actually expecting HTC to unveil two major products at MWC. The first is the next entry in the One pantheon of superphones, which is codenamed &ldquo;Hima&rdquo; and is likely to be known as HTC One M9 when it goes on general release.</p>
<p>Rumours suggest it will have a 5.2-inch screen, a super-fast processor, 3GB of RAM and, unlike its predecessor (HTC One M8), either a 16-megapixel or 20-megapixel camera.</p>
<p>In short, it should be epic.</p>
<p>The other product expected to be unveiled is the company&rsquo;s first smartwatch, which is being developed in partnership with Under Armour and is said to be called HTC One Wear. However, details of that one are thin on the ground, so <em>watch</em> this space for more news.</p>
<h2>LG</h2>
<p>The rumour mill hasn&rsquo;t produced an awful lot about what LG has planned for MWC 2015, but one rumour has been spoken about, although it&rsquo;s not necessarily what you might be expecting; specifically, the rumour says that LG G4 will <em>not</em> be unveiled at MWC 2015, instead being launched later in the year.</p>
<p>If that proves to be true, then it&rsquo;s likely that LG will be focusing on showing off new mid-range phones at MWC 2015, or possibly a new successor to LG G Watch. It&rsquo;s a little up in the air at the moment, so again, watch this space...</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>If the rumours prove to be true, then it may well be that Samsung will completely steal the show. Why? Because the Korean manufacturer may actually be unveiling <em>two</em> sequels to the magnificent Samsung Galaxy S5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost certain that Samsung Galaxy S6 will finally show its face, hopefully bringing an all-metal body, 5.1-inch screen and a super-fast Exynos processor with it. However, on top of that, we may see a <em>second</em> version of Galaxy S6 (tentatively rumoured to be &lsquo;Galaxy S6 Edge&rsquo;), with a wraparound screen just like Samsung Galaxy Note Edge.</p>
<p>Yeah, if that turns out to be true, Samsung could <em>definitely</em> steal the show...</p>
<h2>Sony</h2>
<p>As a counterpoint to that, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that Sony <em>won&rsquo;t</em> steal the show, because the latest rumour is that Sony Xperia Z4, the rumoured sequel to Sony Xperia Z3, won&rsquo;t be unveiled until later in the year. It&rsquo;s also rumoured that Sony won&rsquo;t even have a formal press conference at MWC 2015, so the Japanese manufacturer&rsquo;s offerings could be thin on the ground.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d hope to see <em>something</em> new from it, though, so watch this space.</p>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>Nokia won&rsquo;t be at MWC 2015, as you might expect now that it has basically completed its transition into Microsoft, with the Microsoft brand starting to appear on what would have once been Nokia phones.</p>
<p>Microsoft, however, <em>will</em> be at MWC 2015, with a full press conference for our delectation. We don&rsquo;t yet know what phones will be unveiled, but it&rsquo;s been a while since Nokia Lumia 930 went on sale, so a successor to that phone seems likely. At the same time, there are persistent rumours about a successor to the phone with the PureView camera, Lumia 1020, so there&rsquo;s a chance it may also show its face.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we&rsquo;d expect to see more information about how Windows 10 will scale to be used in smartphones, and a handful of mid-range phones being unveiled (what with Microsoft&rsquo;s desire to really dominate developing markets).</p>
<p><strong>And so, while there are a couple of manufacturers who won&rsquo;t be unveiling new, hyper-powered superphones, this year&rsquo;s MWC is shaping up to be a good one. We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on proceedings, so stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
