<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The bickering continues&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Are China and Russia spying on Trump? Last week, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the US president uses an unsecured iPhone to make calls. The article suggested that both Chinese and Russian spies could be listening in on his private affairs. That&rsquo;s quite a claim.</p>
<p>Of course, not long after this news got out, the Chinese government were quick to respond. Rather than dignifying the accusations with anything close to an answer, it has been reported that the officials came up with a sweet burn for Trump himself.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The so-called experts on Trump over at the New York Times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect I do not have time here to correct it. I only use Government Phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. Story is soooo wrong!</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055412328571850753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>China Fires Back at Trump</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If they are very worried about iPhones being tapped, they can use Huawei,&rdquo; Hua Chunying, deputy director of the Chinese foreign ministry&rsquo;s information department, according to an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/2170177/china-refutes-report-it-spies-trumps-iphone-suggests-he-get-huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> from the South China Morning Post. &ldquo;Seeing this report, I feel there are those in America who are working all-out to win the Oscar for best screenplay.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16197" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5jm20GJOIBOUGJnJOS2a0HTODzwimHtsgZPBou5__5mG14_6fVdFfKf65G0ii9yoLgoXUzAzzdt5sFe13JNIy0-b=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The remark is all-the-more cutting if you consider the relationship between the phone manufacturer and the US. It was not all that long ago that the CIA, FBI, and NSA all put out statements warning the American public not to use <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei phones</a> or products. Following that, AT&amp;T (an American cell phone and tablet distributor) cancelled the launch of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro at the last minute.</p>
<h2>The US Has No Real Evidence</h2>
<p>Despite this extreme reaction, the US have yet to find any evidence to substantiate its claims that Huawei products are unsecure. It is unclear why they believe that the products are not secure. Plus, on the flipside of that, Edward Snowden&rsquo;s leaked information shows that NSA have been spying on Huawei for a year.</p>
<p>Sorry, what now? Is this a case of the pot calling the kettle black much? Either way, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that there is no solid evidence here. The claims have yet to be substantiated and, of course, there&rsquo;s always people who will cry &lsquo;fake news.&rsquo; At the moment, anyway, it just seems like an ongoing slanging match. Watch this space!</p>
