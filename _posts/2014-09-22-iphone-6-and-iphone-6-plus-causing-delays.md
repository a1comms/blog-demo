<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple has broken records once again as its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets have seen a record number of pre-orders since launch, and have consequently caused delays for customers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5118 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus.png" alt="iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus" width="660" height="372" /></p>
<p><em>Scroll down for delivery updates on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.</em></p>
<p>More than 4 million eager iFans ordered the new larger-sized devices within 24 hours of pre-orders going live last Friday. Apple received a further 6 million orders over the opening weekend. The handsets have caused a significant delay in delivery to customers, with many pre-order customers waiting until October before being able to get their hands on their latest smartphone purchase.</p>
<p>"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of preorders&rdquo; Apple spokesperson Trudy Miller, commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand for the new iPhones exceeds the initial pre-order supply and while a significant amount will be delivered to customers beginning on Friday and throughout September, many iPhone pre-orders are scheduled to be delivered in October,&rdquo; the company added.</p>
<p>Whilst every attempt is being made to get stock sent out to customers, delays are inevitable with a highly desirable products such as these. Those who pre-ordered their device will be allocated stock as priority on a first-come first-served basis. We value your custom, and we sincerely appreciate your patience.&nbsp;Please bear with us as we look to fulfil your orders.</p>
