<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">When your bank account's full, but you already spent all your common sense.</span></p>
<p>Take a moment to imagine that money isn&rsquo;t an object; that you can simply afford any mere material thing you have ever desired. What would you buy first?</p>
<p>Most people might picture themselves on a yacht, drinking obscenely expensive champagne, dressed head to toe in one-off designer clothing. In this perfect image, what mobile phone are you equipped with? iPhone 7 simply won&rsquo;t do, everyone&rsquo;s got one, right? No, you need something that&rsquo;s as exclusive as it is pricey.</p>
<p>So, here are ten of the most expensive phones in the world. All of which are totally ridiculous and way beyond our means. But, we can all dream.</p>
<h2>10) Samsung W2015</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11766" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Samsung-W2015.jpg" alt="samsung-w2015" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<p>If you have a spare &pound;1,889, this smartphone is yours. While the flip-phone design may look like something from the early 2000s, this is actually the cutting edge of modern technology.</p>
<p>For that tidy price, you get a fully-functioning screen on the front, and a similar setup once you flip it open. The catch? There&rsquo;s no QWERTY keyboard, which means you&rsquo;ll have to revert to the good old days of pounding the numerical keys numerous times to get the letter you want.</p>
<h2>9) Mobiado Grand Touch Em Marble</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11767" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Mobiado-Grand-Touch-Em-Marble-1.jpg" alt="mobiado-grand-touch-em-marble-1" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>Pfft&hellip; Phones fashioned from metal or plastic are <em>so </em>last year.</p>
<p>Instead, the Mobiado Grand Touch Em Marble is made of one of five different types of stone, bringing a whole new meaning to the word brick, when referring to your mobile. What&rsquo;s more, Mobiado Grand Touch Em Marble will only set you back &pound;2,400. Pocket money&hellip; Am I right?</p>
<p>In terms of usability, other than its fancy exterior, this expansive piece of tech is much like any other smartphone on the market.</p>

<h2>8) Lamborghini 88 Tauri</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11768" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/88-Tauri.jpg" alt="88-tauri" width="600" height="545" /></p>
<p>When you attach the word Lamborghini to something, you can justifiably charge about ten times what you would normally expect it to cost. In this case, the Lamborghini 88 Tauri will set you back &pound;4,000, which is eye-watering to say the least.</p>
<p>But, of course, this isn&rsquo;t simply a regular smartphone. It&rsquo;s clad in three layers: stainless steel, glass and a final layer of calfskin leather. They really have gone above and beyond to make this device look as glamorous as possible.</p>
<h2>7) Tag Heuer Link</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11769" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Tag-Heuer-Link.jpg" alt="tag-heuer-link" width="600" height="398" /></p>
<p>Ever dreamt about having a smartphone that looks exactly like a tortoise shell? No, me neither, but if you opt for the Tag Heuer Link, that&rsquo;s exactly what you get.</p>
<p>The crocodile leather encased piece of technology is one of the most expensive phones in the world, but no one has a clue why. At &pound;5,245, you would expect some incredible features from this smartphone, but in that area, it falls remarkably flat. With just 8GB of memory and a 5-megapixel camera, there appears to be little more than a brand name to shout about.</p>

<h2>6) Mobiado Grand 350 Pioneer</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11770" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Mobiado-Grand-350-Pioneer.jpg" alt="mobiado-grand-350-pioneer" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Since the Mobiado Grand 350 Pioneer has been created from a piece of meteorite, you might say it&rsquo;s out of this world&hellip; Similarly, at &pound;7,460, the price is certainly out of your budget.</p>
<p>Other than the design materials, it offers pretty uninspiring features, which you would expect from any modern-day smartphone. But if you&rsquo;ve got the money for space rocks, who are we to stop you.</p>
<h2>5) Sirin Labs Solarin</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11771" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Sirin-Labs-Solarin.jpg" alt="sirin-labs-solarin" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about people stealing your private information, or the paparazzi somehow getting hold of phone pictures, this could be the mobile for you.</p>
<p>Sure, it will set you back &pound;9,500, but let&rsquo;s not worry about that right now. The main draw of this ultra-expensive phone is that it claims to be resistant to viruses, hackers, and any other nasty phone-related problems.</p>
<p>All encouraging information, but not enough to spend almost ten grand&hellip; Sorry.</p>

<h2>4) Vertu Signature Blue Leather</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11772" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Vertu-Signature-Blue-Leather.jpg" alt="vertu-signature-blue-leather" width="600" height="361" /></p>
<p>The Vertu Signature is on the market for a whopping &pound;14,300&hellip; Ouch.</p>
<p>You must be wondering what the return is&hellip; Well, the case is crafted from calfskin (the wealthy seem to love their calfskin) leather that originated all the way from the Alps. What&rsquo;s more, the phone boasts 64GB of memory and a 21-megapixel camera. Not bad, but is it really worth five figures?</p>
<h2>3) Goldvish Eclipse Diamond Heaven</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11773" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Goldvish-Eclipse-Diamond-Heaven.jpg" alt="goldvish-eclipse-diamond-heaven" width="600" height="407" /></p>
<p>Fancy having 360 diamonds stuffed in your pocket all day, every day? Well, you might want to consider splashing out on a Goldvish Eclipse Diamond Heaven.</p>
<p>Just kidding, this is one of the world&rsquo;s most expensive phones, setting customers back a crazy &pound;28,465. For that price, you get an alligator leather case, encrusted with more diamonds than anyone knows what to do with. The phone itself is not all that impressive, though, featuring a 13-megapixel camera and standard Android OS.</p>

<h2>2) Savelli Champagne Diamond</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11774" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Savelli-Champagne-Diamond.jpg" alt="savelli-champagne-diamond" width="736" height="552" /></p>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;re very much in the realms of the ridiculous, begging the question: would you pay &pound;44,000 for a phone that essentially looks like it&rsquo;s melting?</p>
<p>Um, no, me neither. Still, with 395 diamonds and a gold casing, this is much more than your average smartphone; it&rsquo;s a piece of art. Really, you&rsquo;re paying for the chic Savelli design here because the actual phone boasts nothing competing with mass market high-end smartphones. Still, if you have cash to splash, this is a great gadget to show off just how filthy rich you are.</p>
<h2>1) Dior Reveries Haute Couture</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11778" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Dior-Reveries-Haute-Couture.jpg" alt="dior-reveries-haute-couture" width="600" height="359" /></p>
<p>Finally, Dior have outdone everyone with its Reveries Haute Couture smartphone. At a balance-draining figure of &pound;78,000, this appears to be the world&rsquo;s most expensive phone yet.</p>
<p>The outer casing comes complete with 1,539 diamonds, white gold and mother of pearl. Further still, Dior claims that this gadget has a 12-day standby battery life, which is actually pretty damn impressive.</p>
<p>Only 99 of these beauties have been produced, adding to their alluring exclusivity. But Dior may&nbsp;find itself hard pressed to locate&nbsp;99 people frivolous enough to part with the asking price.</p>
