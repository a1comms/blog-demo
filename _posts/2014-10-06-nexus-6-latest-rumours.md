<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s almost a year since the Nexus 5 was launched, so it&rsquo;s time to turn our thoughts to what its successor, the Nexus 6, might be like. We take a look at the latest rumours, to see how powerful it might be, what its screen might be like, and how pin-sharp its camera might be...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Everyone has an opinion about how Android should operate, and that &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; includes the developers within Google; their opinion of what Android should be like is the foundation of the now-famous range of Nexus phones, the most recent of which (the Nexus 5) was launched in 2013.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s time we looked at the rumours surrounding <i>this</i> year&rsquo;s Nexus phone, and see if we can work out what the Nexus 6 will be like...</p>
<p>The first point to make is that a few people have said there won&rsquo;t <i>be</i> a Nexus 6; Google has now started the Android Silver project, which some pegged as a replacement for the Nexus project. However, Google has committed itself to the Nexus brand, so we&rsquo;ll work on the assumption that the Nexus 6 <i>is</i> happening.</p>
<p>When it does materialise, it&rsquo;s likely to be running on Android L, the newest version of Google&rsquo;s platform, and it&rsquo;s strongly rumoured that the new phone will be built by LG. This does make sense; the Nexus 5 bore similarities to the LG G2, so it&rsquo;s possible the Nexus 6 will be based on the mighty LG G3. However, that could be wrong, as some are speculating that the manufacturer could in fact be Motorola.</p>
<p>Many of the rumours suggest that the Nexus 6 will house a 5-inch+ Quad-HD screen (which would make sense if it is based on the LG G3), and the most recent rumours claim that it will have a Snapdragon 805 processor (at 2.6GHz) and 3GB of RAM. Rumours also point to the camera having been improved from previous version, with it now coming in at 13MP (complete with optical image stabilisation).</p>
<p>Oh, and it might have a fingerprint scanner too...</p>
<p><strong>At the moment there is, of course, no concrete information from Google, but with the Nexus 6 due to be unveiled within the next few weeks, we don&rsquo;t have long to wait till we find out. Stay tuned for more news!&nbsp;</strong></p>
