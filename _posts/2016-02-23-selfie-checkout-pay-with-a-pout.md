<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Start working on your selfie game, because selfie-checkouts are the next big thing in mobile payment.</span></p>
<p>Just when you thought the credit industry was safe from the sweeping trend that is <em>the selfie</em>, reports have emerged revealing that MasterCard is bringing &ldquo;selfie pay&rdquo; technology to the UK.</p>
<p>Called MasterCard Identity Check, it maps users&rsquo; faces to authenticate their identity and bypass the need for passwords, pin codes and other memory-straining verification methods. Self-checkouts become selfie-checkouts...</p>
<p>MasterCard is purportedly launching its new payment service in the UK this summer, along with 14 other countries, after successful trials in both the USA and Netherlands (ironically, you can&rsquo;t go Dutch).</p>
<p>Once rolled out, you&rsquo;ll be able to download a bespoke MasterCard app that takes your mug shot and logs the unique structure and contours of your face (and pout, presumably), to be archived by the credit giant on its database.</p>
<p>So when you come to make a purchase on your mobile, MasterCard Identity Check will allow you to verify yourself with a cheeky grin. No failed password attempts. No time wasted. But plenty of quizzical looks from passer-bys.</p>
<p>To safeguard imposters from using pictures of you to fraudulently authorise payments, the payment system requires you to blink when staring into the camera. Cue even more quizzical looks&hellip;</p>
<p>Alternatively, users will be able to utilise their fingerprint to verify their identity, much like Apple Pay on iPhones.</p>
