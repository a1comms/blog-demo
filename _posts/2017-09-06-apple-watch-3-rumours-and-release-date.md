<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what we (think) we know so far!</span></p>
<p>Make no mistakes, wearable technology is a huge deal. What&rsquo;s more, leading the way in this particular area you have none other than Apple Watch and Apple Watch 2.</p>
<p>Of course, the two smartwatches have been big hits for Apple, but what&rsquo;s next? We&rsquo;ve had our ears to the ground, and so here are some of the major rumours about the next generation Apple Watch.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 Release Date</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about what everybody is dying to know. When will Apple Watch 3 (if it <em>is </em>called that) be available? Well, that remains to be seen right now. With the big Apple press release scheduled for 12th September, it&rsquo;s most likely that we&rsquo;ll have a final release date then.</p>
<p>All we can do right now is speculate. So, here goes: Apple Watch 2 was released mid-September last year. There will be at least a year between that device and the next one, which means that we could expect it to launch from late September.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5t21_e7_-cQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>However, unlike iPhones, there&rsquo;s nothing to say that Apple's smartwatches will see a new generation year-on-year. So, in theory, it could be 2018 before we see Apple Watch 3 hit stores.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 Design Rumours</h2>
<p>But enough about when we can get our hands on it; let&rsquo;s talk about Apple Watch 3&rsquo;s design. Both Apple Watch and Apple Watch 2 had strikingly similar designs. So, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge leap should the third-generation Watch follow a similar style .</p>
<p>However, there are some exciting rumours flying around, revealing some new design changes. For one thing, <a href="https://marketexclusive.com/apple-watch-3-rumors/2017/03/86610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Exclusive</a> recently reported that Apple had patented a smart fabric for the band of the watch. Perhaps the strap will have its own display, measure user&rsquo;s pulse, or even check the temperature.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14891" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dT1h-lHHXrZ5xp5JpZlHuqLVaz8FtlRrz10LQEBkpFm_jAMAP2N0n7SqVnKOTlQxNmiu2P0nVtuS8bfSWBLlUJ8=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another rumour from the same source claims Apple Watch 3 will feature a micro-LED display and, what&rsquo;s more, that the overall size of the watch screen will change too. Plus, DigiTimes suggests that there may be a new glass-film touch, which will replace the previous touchscreen technology.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 Camera Rumours</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks of the previous Apple Watches is the fact that they don&rsquo;t feature a camera. Well, that could all be about to change. One of the biggest rumours surrounding the Apple Watch 3 is the new built-in camera. That would be a huge deal, meaning users could make FaceTime calls on the Watch itself.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNpiwOkKIJ8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Though, there&rsquo;s nothing to support that FaceTime is a priority for Apple. What&rsquo;s more, a built-in camera could take up more space, and the developers will likely want to keep it as small and sleek as possible. So, it&rsquo;s unclear whether this feature will materialise.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 OS and Power Rumours</h2>
<p>We already know that watchOS 4 is on its way. Still, since we haven&rsquo;t got confirmation on when the next Apple Watch will launch, it may not be the operating system that it runs. If the device doesn&rsquo;t come out until next year, the likelihood is that the watch will have an entirely new operating system to boot. Intriguing&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14894" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dRLXCWz2quF8i7HM2Hjm29_vtUsl1potGJClm0oV7R68skw-emjCF2fNdINCVGQLzqisON6UsRT48D6dac18PWY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to performance and power, though, there isn&rsquo;t much information out there at all. All we can say is that these are two of the major areas in which the developers will want to up their game somewhat. Plus, it&rsquo;s very likely that the Apple Watch will pack more power than its predecessors.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 Rumoured Features</h2>
<p>But wait, what other features will the Watch have going for it? Well, quite a few if we&rsquo;re to believe all the rumours. Here are some of our favourites:</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Tracking </strong></p>
<p>Sleep tracking is likely to be a major deal when the device comes out. Apple recently bought <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/apple-just-bought-beddit-the-fitbit-for-sleep-tracking">Beddit</a>, an app described by its founder as &ldquo;Fitbit for sleep tracking.&rdquo; So, it&rsquo;s no mystery that Apple is putting a whole load of emphasis on this area. It&rsquo;s likely that Apple Watch 3 will have advanced sleep-tracking features among other things.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14895" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lesw0XQAE7V5QJJ9soQ-tb6yQGbMqN3Q8G1p8dpyU6Je7OAzu_tCz6_JrWRB4m9BP-qX-60SRRbE8CMd9IgzVC6XQw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Improved Wireless Charging</strong></p>
<p>If you think that wireless charging is the way forward, you&rsquo;re going to love this next rumour. Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09577467&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=36D95C48A01F&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,577,467.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,577,467%2526RS=PN/9,577,467">latest patent</a> seems to show an improved wireless charging system. In theory, the stand would allow users to pop their watch anywhere on it to charge it. That means no more fiddling around when it comes to getting your device to connect to the charger. Phew &mdash; that&rsquo;s a relief.</p>
<p><strong>Respiration Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Another of Apple&rsquo;s recent <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220170164884%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20170164884&amp;RS=DN/20170164884">patents</a> could reveal more about a new Apple Watch feature. It looks to be a set that can measure your respiratory rate. While there&rsquo;s no mention of the watch itself, it could well be that Apple is planning to integrate this technology into the Apple Watch, perhaps for added health benefits to users, or for those using it for fitness tracking.</p>

<p><strong>Phone-Free Features</strong></p>
<p>One of the major drawbacks with the current Apple Watch models is the fact that they rely heavily on your phone. In as much as you need your iPhone to sync up most of the apps and features. It would make sense for the next generation of the device to move away from this trend and offer more independent features.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 3 Price Rumours</h2>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t know how much the next Apple Watch will cost just yet. But, we can look at history to give us an idea. The first Apple Watch was &pound;299, though the price jumped to &pound;369 when the second-generation model hit stores. With that in mind, we expect that the third-generation Apple Watch to cost somewhere between the two, or possibly slightly more.<em> Watch</em> this space, we guess.</p>
