<p><span class="postStandFirst">In this body-conscious world we live in it seems that everyone is striving for a healthier lifestyle, but how exactly can Samsung's latest smartphone assist you in your quest?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8414/8704959302_aa6bfb6411_m.jpg" width="147" height="240" /></strong>Smartphones have well and truly established themselves as an essential item that can never leave our side. We carry them everywhere with us and experience a sense of detachment if they get left behind. They have quickly become our organisers, information sources, cameras, music players and our gateway to the world, but now they can also be our helath and lifestyle monitors too with the creation of Samsung's S-Health on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s4-review">Samsung Galaxy S4</a>.</p>
<p>S Health is an application that is part of the TouchWiz user interface, Samsung&rsquo;s own Android skin. The application works in conjunction with the built-in device sensors and is designed to optimise promotion of a healthier lifestyle.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8140/8703834563_87b805e243_m.jpg" width="127" height="240" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Samsung is planning on releasing peripherals for the Galaxy S4 and one of those is the Smart Band which works with the S Health app to relay information, such as pulse readings and heart rate, straight back to the device.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8404/8704959340_81d8f47c27_m.jpg" width="155" height="240" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many different functions within the application. For example there is an accurate pedometer which works with the phone's sensors and informs you of how many steps you have taken, the distance you have walked and, most importantly for those&nbsp;watching their figures, how many calories have been burned. An exercise tracker is also present which monitors your activity during a chosen sport.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8274/8704959292_c9eb5cb7f3_m.jpg" width="161" height="240" /></p>
<p>One of the more unique features of S Health is the inclusion of the food tracker function. This can monitor exactly what you eat, as well as the number of calories consumed, so you don&rsquo;t exceed your daily allowance. There is even an included function which provides the ability to take a photo in order to determine what food you are having, which is then located in a huge food data base! This is great if you&rsquo;re at a restaurant and want to know how many calories are in your chosen meal.</p>
<p><strong>All-in-all, S Health is a clever little app which can prove to be an invaluable asset ion your quest to live </strong><strong>a healthier lifestyle!</strong></p>
