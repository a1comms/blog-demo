<p>There&rsquo;s no other way of putting it. It&rsquo;s just plain creepy. You&rsquo;ve never met this person before, and yet somehow they know everything from where you went to school to what you ate for dinner last night. There&rsquo;s only one conclusion to be drawn here - they&rsquo;re a Facebook stalker.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about people visiting your Facebook profile page and finding everything out about you, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. These days, online security is more important than ever before. Since we all tend to overshare online, we really do need to know who can see our posts and information.</p>

<p>While you may believe that you&rsquo;re sharing things with a select few i.e. your Facebook friends, that may not be the case. Here&rsquo;s how to make your Facebook profile private so strangers can&rsquo;t snoop on you.</p>
<h2>Check Your Privacy Settings</h2>
<p>It might sound obvious, and yet few of us actually bother to check our Privacy Settings to see what&rsquo;s going on there. You may not even know where to find these settings, but it&rsquo;s shockingly simple.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on the Facebook homepage, just go to the top right of the screen. Next to your friend requests, messages, and notifications, you should see another little button shaped like a padlock. Click on this icon and then click on &lsquo;See More Settings&rsquo;. From there, you should be able to see all your saved settings quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>Control Who Can Contact You</h2>
<p>While as default, messages from people you&rsquo;re not friends with tend to go into a filtered inbox, the last thing you want is random people messaging you. If you&rsquo;re worried about who can and can&rsquo;t get in touch with you, you can customise this within your Privacy Settings.</p>
<p>All you need to do is click on &lsquo;Who can contact me?&rsquo; and change the filter that you currently have set. If it&rsquo;s set to &lsquo;basic filtering&rsquo;, you will need to switch it to &lsquo;strict filtering&rsquo;. That way, you can be 100% sure that no weirdos (that you don&rsquo;t know) can message you.</p>
<h2>Control What People See On Your Profile</h2>
<p>Some of us are a little too slapdash when it comes to sharing our details online. Of course, you should <em>never </em>share sensitive information on Facebook. That&rsquo;s rule 101, right there. Still, if you don&rsquo;t want your boss to see you checking into twenty bars on a Sunday night, here&rsquo;s how to make your Facebook profile private.</p>
<p>In the Privacy Settings, click on the tab that says &lsquo;Who can see my future posts?&rsquo; In the drop-down menu, you will find a little button that says &lsquo;Custom&rsquo;. If you click that, you can exclude certain people (i.e. your boss) from seeing anything you post from now on.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you just want your friends (and not your friends of friends) to see your posts, you can select the &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; option here.</p>
<h2>Stop Random Friend Requests</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you keep getting random friend requests from people, there&rsquo;s a quick way to stop that. Within the &lsquo;Who can look me up?&rsquo; tab, you can fully control who can find your profile when they use your phone or email address to try to locate you. Make sure that you select &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; in the drop-down lists next to both of these options.</p>
<p>But wait, what about people finding you through Google or Bing? If you want that extra level of security, there&rsquo;s an option to exclude your profile from these searches. Next to the question &lsquo;Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile?&rsquo;, just select &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Yeah, it&rsquo;s <em>that</em> straightforward.</p>
<h2>Say Bye to Facebook Forever</h2>
<p>If you want to go all out in terms of security, this one&rsquo;s for you. Of course, the best level of Facebook security is not having a profile at all. *Gasp* You can, of course, delete your profile by going to the &lsquo;Security&rsquo; tab and clicking &lsquo;Deactivate my account&rsquo;. You will have to give a reason for leaving but once you&rsquo;ve done so, you can say bye to Facebook forever.</p>
