<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Spoiler: It costs an arm and a leg!</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; If you&rsquo;re an eco-warrior, you&rsquo;re sure to be interested in any new product that helps to save energy and make things just a little more sustainable. Luckily, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. We&rsquo;ve got the down-low on an awesome, new phone case.</p>
<p>Caviar, a Russian accessory maker (who brought us a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/you-can-buy-a-special-trump-putin-edition-nokia-3310-for-just-1900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tump-Putin embossed Nokia 3310</a>), has created the iPhone X case the world has been waiting for. Not only does it look remarkably high-end but it can also charge your phone using solar power. Yes, you read that right. Say hello to the iPhone X Tesla.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17517" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ap8syWU0A2o5R2b167mN2z-dYdDd1ndOHjO84pcGdyLdNlfwWEvFuXT0Y0kFn6pHsgzKmzjE2rWjuwsgEiDrQP7GPg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Unlike other phone cases, though, this one will come pre-attached to your iPhone, which means that you have to buy it along with the device. Rumour has it that the very first phone will be sent to&hellip; Elon Musk. It makes sense, since the guy has been known for his work in the field of sustainable energy, this latest invention should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>So, what can you expect? Well, aside from <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/this-is-how-much-it-costs-you-to-charge-your-phone-for-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saving you pennies on your electricity bill</a>, the phone case claims that it can &lsquo;help the world to become eco-friendly.&rsquo; It may sound like a futuristic idea, but the tech here is very much of our time. Here&rsquo;s what the <a href="http://caviar.global/caviar-iphone-x-en/tesla-en-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product description</a> says about it all:</p>
<p><em>iPhone X Tesla by Caviar is equipped with a solar battery that transforms the light energy and replenishes the phone battery power with its help. This phone gets power literally from the air! This is the purest energy, for getting which no expenses are needed.</em></p>

<p><em>The development in the sphere of creating solar batteries, smart homes, equipped with such batteries and vehicles working on the electricity, is actively carried out by Elon Musk today &ndash; the main mastermind of the Tesla Company; in honor of his great innovative developments, the new Caviar phone was named.</em></p>
<p>Tempted? If you like the sound of the phone case, you should know that it won&rsquo;t come cheap. It costs the equivalent of &pound;3,392. Yikes. It might be a little more than you expected. Still, that&rsquo;s the price you pay for saving the world and rocking the Tesla brand on your iPhone.</p>
