<p><span class="postStandFirst">BT has agreed to buy <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/ee">EE</a>, for the sum of &pound;12.5 billion. It remains to be seen how this deal will affect the mobile landscape (although we suspect the effect will be immense), and whether the deal will gain regulatory approval, but this is perhaps the biggest news to hit the mobile world in ages...</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6051" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/cKYnP1ZDizeo6ShHF6u5Tx82jRtuo7zjn1B_vxIZU30RmLoRxEaAzzVhuauJZP1PuAw300.png" alt="EE" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been waiting to hear which network BT would offer to buy, after the news that the communications giant was sniffing around both EE and O2, and now, while the deal still needs to get regulatory approval, we have our answer.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/11294252/BT-agrees-to-buy-EE-for-12.5bn.html">The Telegraph</a>, BT has agreed to buy EE for the princely sum of &pound;12.5 billion.</p>
<p>The move will give BT the largest customer base of any communications company in the UK, while allowing them to control an unparalleled chunk of the UK&rsquo;s mobile spectrum (the benefits of which, <em>for BT</em>, are immediately obvious). As for the parent companies of EE, both Deutsche Telekom and Orange will get a combination of cold, hard cash and newly issued BT shares, with Deutsche Telekom getting a 12% stake in BT (along with the right to appoint a director), and Orange getting a 4% stake (although Orange will get more of a cash payout, to make up for them not being able to appoint a director).</p>
<p>Naturally, customers in the UK have questioned how this will affect them. Will it make phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the LG G3 cheaper (when bought on a contract)? Analysts have suggested that BT will begin to push &ldquo;quad-play&rdquo; deals more forcefully (with mobile, landline, broadband and TV all bundled as one package), and some have wondered whether this will make it harder to switch contracts in future.</p>
<p>At the same time, some have suggested that this is a worrying move, as it would give BT a <em>lot</em> of control (possibly <em>too much</em>) of UK customers.</p>
<p><strong>The deal still needs to pass through regulatory approval, and it remains to be seen how other networks will react to this (for instance, some suggest Hutchison Whampoa, who owns 3, could bid for O2), but one thing is for sure: this is going to shake up the mobile landscape like never before!</strong></p>
