<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Sony Xperia SP is a great device that marries form and function perfectly.</span></p>
<p>Sony have been riding high in the flagship market for some time now with the amazing Xperia Z, a quad-core processing, 13 megapixel-packing, full HD superphone! Now the electronic giant is aiming for mid-range supremacy with the&nbsp;Sony Xperia SP.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/sony_xperia_sp.jpg" width="168" height="335" />The build quality of the Xperia SP is the first thing you will notice about the device, dressed in either white or black, the device is beautiful, housed in a metal bezel with a unique translucent light strip at the bottom of the phone that changes colour depending on the function. The front of the display is dominated by a 720p, 4.6 inch display that is clear, sharp and has excellent colours. On the rear of the device, the light strip can be seen and towards the top of the phone is an excellent 8 megapixel camera, that features Sony&rsquo;s trademark image wizardry.</p>
<p>The Xperia SP is running on Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 with Sony&rsquo;s minimal operator software sitting on top which contains the usual Sony apps such as Playstation Mobile, Walkman and Movies.</p>
<p>Powering the device is a dual-core 1.7 GHz chipset with 1GB of RAM, giving the SP plenty of zip to handle apps, games and web browsing without any problem.</p>
<p>On-board there is an internal battery with a capacity of 2370 mAh, which provides plenty of juice, as well as 8GB storage, with the facility to upgrade the memory by a further 32GB through a microSD card.</p>
<p>Adding value to the phone is the inclusion of 4G LTE support and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, both of which are premium technologies which are usually kept for flagship handsets.</p>
<p><strong>Overall the Sony Xperia SP is a fantastic phone, offering a HD screen, powerful chipset, great camera and 4G support all crammed into a smart and well-built mid-range handset that offers excellent value for money.</strong></p>
