<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&lsquo;Appy summertime!</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again! Whether you&rsquo;re a beach-loving babe or a city hopper, it&rsquo;s time to plan your summer break. Luckily, your smartphone can help you along the way. Here are seven little apps that will get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<h2>1) KAYAK</h2>
<p>Before you jet off to lands afar, you have to actually plan your holiday. That&rsquo;s where KAYAK comes into the picture. Using this handy little app, you can search for cheap flights, hotels, and even car hire deals at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also add specific destinations to your &lsquo;watchlist&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll get notifications when the cheapest flights are released. Nice! Extra features include live flight updates and an offline travel mode.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the app for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kayak.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/apple-store/id305204535?ct=landing&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>2) CityMapper</h2>
<p>Should you be heading on a city break, CityMapper is your go-to app for getting around. It covers major cities &ndash; from New York to Barcelona &ndash; and can help you map out your trips.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re hoping to get to a specific restaurant, just pop it in the app and then watch as it pulls up loads of options for you. From catching an Uber to using the underground (and occasionally some random options like teleporting!), the app will tell you the quickest way to get where you need to be.</p>

<h2>3) Booking.com</h2>
<p>Booking.com is a third-party booking system that can help you to find hotels and flights at a decent price. You might have already used it online. What many people don&rsquo;t happen to know, though, is the fact that there&rsquo;s actually a free app that you can use here too.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve downloaded the Booking.com app, you can login, check and change your bookings, as well as getting up-to-date information that might affect you. Simple.</p>

<h2>4) Skyscanner</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to save some pennies on your next trip, comparing the cost of your travel is a great place to start. Skyscanner can help you do just that.</p>
<p>There was a time when you could just explore different flights using this site (and now, an app!) but things have changed for the better. The service now covers trains, hotels and even car hire too! There&rsquo;s also a sweet &lsquo;top deals&rsquo; feature which means that you can find the latest offers quickly.</p>

<h2>5)&nbsp; TripAdvisor</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re booking a hotel, looking for an experience, or finding an eatery in which to dine, you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with TripAdvisor. Yes, the review site is a must-have for avid tourists.</p>
<p>TripAdvisor gives you a quick insight into whether the place you&rsquo;ve picked is going to be a winner or a complete letdown. Powered by people, A.K.A consumer reviews, you&rsquo;re sure to get a realistic impression of how each place is. Perfect.</p>

<h2>6) Expedia</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush &ndash;&nbsp;going on holiday is fun, but planning your trip can be a real pain. If you want to keep all your plans and bookings in one place, the Expedia app could very well be the answer. Before you go away, you can use the app to book everything from your hotel and flight to your rentals.</p>
<p>There is also a fun &lsquo;things to do&rsquo; feature, which means that you can easily figure out what the highlights of your trip are going to be. Store all this info in one place and set it to &lsquo;offline mode&rsquo; and you can see your itinerary no matter where you are.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the app for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.expedia.bookings&amp;referrer=mat_click_id%3Dda0bd7a18d8e3951d4484235ac4750b2-20180619-159126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/expedia-hotels-flights-cars/id427916203?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>7) Google Maps</h2>
<p>The last thing you need when you&rsquo;re on holiday is to get lost. Whether you&rsquo;re trekking in the countryside or heading to a big city, finding your way around can be difficult, at the best of times.</p>
<p>You may already have Google Maps on your phone but, if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s time to download it. Not only can you map out routes, but you can also find out what places are nearby. From cafes and restaurants, or supermarkets, finding the stuff you need most couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Oh, there's one other handy feature too, particularly if you're travelling abroad. You can download maps to use offline, very useful when you've ran out of data or there's no WiFi.</p>
