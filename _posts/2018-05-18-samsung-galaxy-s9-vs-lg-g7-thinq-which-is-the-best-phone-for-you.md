<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Clash of the flagships!</span></p>
<p>Looking to upgrade your phone? You&rsquo;re in luck! There&rsquo;s a whole host of snazzy little flagship phones on the market right now. Two of the best have to be the LG G7 ThinQ and the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S9</a>. But which is better? Let&rsquo;s take a look at the features and facts.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Minimalism is king, but there are some subtle differences between the two phones. While they both stick to the modern rules of smartphone design, they are by no means identical.</p>
<p>For one thing, the S9 has that pebble-like curve that we&rsquo;ve seen on previous Samsung phones. It&rsquo;s a real crowd-pleaser. There&rsquo;s a massive screen and not much else here, with the phone coming in Midnight Black, Coral Blue, Titanium Grey and Lilac Purple.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16757" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hzp7y0PtdfTDtnC9W012ifLcdMi9P6JftNpjfTsbz6nWrRtGcklN3RpVrrJIlRK33GovolY9htyFqBttctNEcjyI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The LG G7 ThinQ is actually very similar in design and comes in different colour tones; New Platinum Grey, New Aurora Black, New Moroccan Blue and Raspberry Rose. It&rsquo;s also a little thinner and longer than Samsung&rsquo;s offering at 153.2 x 71.9 x 7.9mm (the S9 comes in at 147.7 x 68.7 x 8.5mm). All in all, they&rsquo;re both stunning, high-end devices.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Of course, Samsung&rsquo;s Infinity Display is making another appearance on this latest flagship phone. The device is packing a 5.8-inch Quad HD+ (2960 x 1440) 18.5:9 Super AMOLED screen, which has been touted as being able to reach super bright levels and clarity. Nice.</p>
<p>However, when you check out the display on the G7, it&rsquo;s a similar story. There&rsquo;s a 6.1-inch (3120 x 1440) 19.5:9 IPS LCD screen here. The reality is that, given the different dimensions, it will give you around the same level of quality and experience as you&rsquo;ll get from the S9.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17487" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LIpMyCeC0XYORJg3TKouhlJeUYvrxIUaDfmeRfyuniPSDbK2Kk3_c__Ng8wHykHoomU8Mf4Sd1Jc-eGaDk7vGIOtnw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Leading the way for smartphones everywhere, some of the features you get with these devices overlap. Both offer wireless charging, a headphone jack, and a fingerprint scanner. So far, so similar.</p>
<p>When it comes to the main technology here, though, there&rsquo;s a gulf of difference between the two phones. The Samsung S9 is a high-end machine. It&rsquo;s packing Facial Recognition, the DeX technology, AR Emoji, Bixby AI, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been positioned to properly compete with the major players in the smartphone world (Apple, Huawei, and the like!). There&rsquo;s no beating around the bush &ndash;&nbsp;what it brings to the table is seriously impressive.</p>
<p>The LG G7 ThinQ doesn&rsquo;t quite compete&hellip; But that&rsquo;s because it's not trying to. It&rsquo;s not in the same race. Rather than doing the same things that other flagship devices do, this phone offers a whole new experience.</p>
<p>The far-field voice recognition works with Google Assistant to create a unique feature, while the Boombox Speaker is sure to entice some music-lovers to get the device.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The main camera on the Galaxy S9 is a 12MP offering and it has variable aperture too. That means that it can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4. There&rsquo;s an 8MP front-facing (or selfie) camera too which should be enough for most people. Oh, and let&rsquo;s not forget that Samsung typically has a bunch of cool camera shooting modes and features.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfQwZoYRb_M" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The camera offering on the G7 speaks for itself. It&rsquo;s clear that this is an area of great focus (pun intended) for LG. The main lens is a 16MP f/1.6 while there&rsquo;s also a great 16MP f/1.9 wide-angle lens too.</p>
<p>Plus, you&rsquo;ve got scene recognition, which is powered by AI, and the much-hyped Super Bright mode. When you&rsquo;re taking pictures in low-light conditions, you may well find that these are useful little features. The selfie cam is also 8MP, just like the S9.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s under the hood? Well, Android 8 Oreo is the system on everybody&rsquo;s lips, and both these flagship devices run it. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it to use them, though. Both LG and Samsung have overlaid their own skins. That means that the user experience is unique to each phone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17482 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/lg-g7-deals.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>When it comes to chipsets and storage, there&rsquo;s nothing between the two phones. Both have the Snapdragon 845 chipset, with 4GB of RAM and a decent enough 64GB of storage. The batteries are the same too, with both sporting a 3,000mAh number.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While both the G7 and S9 are stellar phones that will strike a chord with the modern-day tech lover, they are quite different. If you&rsquo;re looking for a device that ticks all the boxes and gives you what you expect from a flagship, the Samsung is the way to go.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you fancy trying something new and taking a leap, you might want to give the LG a whirl. Packed with an impressive camera and some intriguing features, you might just find that it&rsquo;s the phone for you. The choice is yours!</p>
