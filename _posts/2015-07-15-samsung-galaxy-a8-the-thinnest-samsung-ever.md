<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has unveiled its slimmest phone ever, the gorgeous Samsung Galaxy A8. With surprisingly good specs for such a slim phone, not to mention a huge battery capacity, the Galaxy A8 is looking like a real winner!</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-7393 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/samsung-galaxy-a8-2015-07-15-01-1024x569.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/samsung-galaxy-a8-2015-07-15-01.jpg alt=&rdquo;Samsung Galaxy A8&rdquo;/>" width="960" height="533" /></p>
<p>High-end specifications aren&rsquo;t the only things that smartphones compete on. These days, consumers have got used to seeing top-end smartphones that <em>also</em> have catwalk good looks, and one feature that remains incredibly popular is a super-slim body.</p>
<p>Samsung has clearly taken that on board, because according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/15/samsungs-galaxy-a8/">Engadget</a>, the Korean manufacturer has now launched its thinnest phone yet into the Chinese market!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Samsung Galaxy A8, and that slimness is clearly the main selling feature here; with a body that measures just 5.9mm from front to back, the Galaxy A8 really is a <em>super</em>-slim phone.</p>
<p>It also has a 5.7-inch screen, putting it firmly in phablet territory, presumably because a body so slim doesn&rsquo;t offer much space for components.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, Samsung Galaxy A8 comes with an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor (along with 2GB of RAM), and a 16MP camera with HDR.</p>
<p>As such, the Galaxy A8 is most definitely a mid to high-range phone (a fact that&rsquo;s reinforced by the 1080p resolution of the screen), but it&rsquo;s easily one of the best-looking we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also impressed by its 3050mAh battery, which is a higher-capacity than the one in the Samsung Galaxy S6!</p>
<p>At the moment, Samsung Galaxy A8 has only been unveiled in China, for Asian markets, and there is no indication of when it might come to the UK.</p>
