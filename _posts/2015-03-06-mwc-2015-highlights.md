<p><span class="postStandFirst">Mobile World Congress 2015. The biggest event of the mobile year. It has turned out to be a fantastic one, too, so join us as we take a look at some of the cool new stuff on display, from HTC and Samsung&rsquo;s new superphones, to the next stage of Google&rsquo;s march towards world dominance...</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6295 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/11024614_10152881059013649_3875851269741038092_n.jpg" alt="MWC 2015" width="645" height="600" /></p>
<p>After weeks of waiting patiently, it&rsquo;s finally time for the biggest event in the mobile industry&rsquo;s calendar; yep, it&rsquo;s MWC 2015 week! Traditionally, we always see quite a lot of cool new stuff at the Mobile World Congress, and while some manufacturers have chosen to not show off their latest superphones (Sony, LG, we&rsquo;re looking at <em>you</em>), there have been some awesome announcements.</p>
<p>But what are the best bits so far?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>HTC One M9 has been the subject of many rumours for weeks now, but it has finally been unveiled. The verdict: we love it. Looks wise, it&rsquo;s an incremental step forward, but noticeable nonetheless, thanks to its dual-tone design and polished edges.</p>
<p>Under the hood, however, it&rsquo;s an all new affair, with an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and, somewhat surprisingly, a 20-megapixel camera (yep, the UltraPixel camera no longer resides on the back of HTC One M9; it&rsquo;s been moved to the front). It&rsquo;s a slight shame that the screen resolution is 1080p rather than Quad HD, but other than that, HTC One M9 looks like a real winner!</p>
<p>Announced alongside HTC One M9 were HTC Grip (a new fitness tracker, that comes with built-in GPS and a flexible screen, to make it stand out from the crowd) and HTC Vive (a VR headset that has turned out to be really exciting, since it&rsquo;s being co-developed with <em>Valve</em>, arguably the single biggest name in PC gaming; go look how many PC gamers don&rsquo;t use Valve&rsquo;s Steam platform, and we reckon you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s a <em>very</em> low number).</p>

<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>Samsung, meanwhile, has used MWC 2015 to unveil not one but <em>two</em> new superphones to an expectant public. There&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy S6, of course, and then there&rsquo;s its sister ship, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. Inside, the two phones are basically the same, with an octa-core Exynos processor, 3GB of RAM, a 16-megapixel camera and a 5.1-inch Quad HD screen. Both phones are also <em>achingly</em> pretty, with the textured backplate of Samsung Galaxy S5 replaced by a mix of aluminium and glass.</p>
<p>Galaxy S6 Edge may end up being the headline-grabber, though, thanks to its wraparound screen; just like Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Edge, it gives you a bit more functionality while looking utterly beguiling, so we expect this one to be a winner!</p>

<h2>Motorola</h2>
<p>When it comes to entry-level and mid-range smartphones, there&rsquo;s just no beating Motorola at the minute. After redefining the mid-range (<em>again</em>) with the new version of Motorola Moto G, Motorola has now redefined the entry-level phone (<em>again, again</em>) with the new Motorola Moto E. It&rsquo;s got a new quad-core processor, it&rsquo;s got 8GB of storage instead of 4GB, and the screen size has been upped to 4.5-inches. It&rsquo;s now available to buy here.</p>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>Speaking of budget phones, Microsoft&rsquo;s gone and unveiled two of them (Lumia 640 and the Lumia 640 XL) and the first thing you&rsquo;ll no doubt notice is that the Nokia name is no more; both come branded as <em>Microsoft</em> handsets, retaining just the &ldquo;Lumia&rdquo; part of the name. They&rsquo;re both rather nice phones, too, with Lumia 640 sporting a 5-inch 720p screen and an 8-megapixel camera, and Lumia 640 XL (Microsoft&rsquo;s first budget phablet) sporting a 5.7-inch 720p screen and a 13-megapixel camera. Both come with quad-core Snapdragon processors and 1GB of RAM, and they will be hitting shelves later in the year.</p>

<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to the unexpected news: Google is starting up its own mobile network! There are very few details at present, but it&rsquo;s going to be a virtual network (much like Virgin Mobile), although Google&rsquo;s Sundar Pichai said that it might not be a standalone virtual network, instead being a kind of white label service, with hints of the &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo; ethos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a bit vague at the moment, but this one is going to be really exciting to follow!</p>
<p><strong>And there we have it. It could have been a more eventful year if a couple more manufacturers had brought some top-end stuff to show off (Sony, LG, we&rsquo;re <em>still</em> looking at you), but all in all, MWC 2015 has most definitely been a good&rsquo;n! </strong></p>
