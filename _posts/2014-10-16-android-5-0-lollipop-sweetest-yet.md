<p><span class="postStandFirst">Dubbed as Google&rsquo;s &lsquo;largest, most ambitious release&rsquo; yet, Android 5.0 Lollipop was finally announced yesterday.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5728" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Lollipop-Forest-1024x576.jpg" alt="Android 5.0 Lollipop" width="960" height="540" /><span class="caption">Image: Lollipop Forest, courtesy of Google.</span></p>
<p>After months of trying to predict what Android 5.0 would be nicknamed, without a confectionery clue to go by, Google has finally revealed its sweetest OS iteration yet &ndash; Android 5.0 Lollipop.</p>
<p>It was announced just yesterday, in tandem with the unveiling of the Nexus 6 &ndash; Google&rsquo;s sixth generation Nexus. This colossal 6-inch phablet has the honour of debuting Android 5.0 Lollipop next month, upon its global launch.</p>
<p>Google abated our agitation with a few licks of its Lollipop at Google I/O 2014, but being the petulant children that we all are, we wanted the whole thing, not just a taster.</p>
<p>But at last, we&rsquo;ve got the scoop, in the form of a digestible rundown of Android 5.0 Lollipop&rsquo;s foremost features</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Android 5.0 Lollipop will be taking on a &ldquo;material design&rdquo;, which will consist of a more colourful and playful layout, with a mix of flat user interfaces that are designed to offer better depth of field. Google also spoke about introducing a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; motion in order to create an &ldquo;enchantment&rdquo; factor. How very mysterious.</p>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>Similarly to iOS, Android users will soon be able to respond to notifications from the lock screen, and will have the option to customise exactly which notification cards appear there.</p>
<p>Heads Up will allow users, who&rsquo;re watching a video or movie, to respond to emails, texts and calls from a notification card that pops up at the top of the screen. If you&rsquo;re far too engrossed in whatever you&rsquo;re watching, you can just swipe the notification up to store it for later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5729 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Android-lollipop-notifications_w_600.jpg" alt="Android 5.0 Lollipop - Notifications " width="600" height="464" /></p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>Devices running on Android 5.0 Lollipop can expect some improvements to their battery life, thanks to ART &ndash; a feature that turns off background data when your smartphone is flagging. You can either switch this conservative little companion on manually, or set to automatically engage when you hit a certain battery level.</p>
<p>Google claims that it can provide you with an extra 90 minutes of user time. That&rsquo;s a big win.</p>
<h2>Multitasking</h2>
<p>Seemingly modeled on the Chrome app for Android, a new &ldquo;Recents&rdquo; menu compiles a list of running background apps as a stack of cards. This should allow users to switch between apps a little quicker.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Smartphones running on Android 5.0 Lollipop will ship already encrypted, in order to curtail the appeal of theft. This will no doubt prove a winning feature for the more private Android users amongst you, as your data won&rsquo;t ever be recoverable once you wipe your device.</p>
<h2>Quick Settings</h2>
<p>Again, Google seems to have borrowed a little bit of inspiration from iOS, which isn&rsquo;t a terrible thing, as Android 5.0 Lollipop is to feature a handy pull down quick settings menu, with controls for a flashlight, screen casting, screen rotation, hotspot and more. You&rsquo;ll also be able to control your brightness with more autonomy, without the need to switch automatic brightness off.</p>
<h2>Device Sharing</h2>
<p>Android 5.0 Lollipop will now enable users to create a multitude of profiles for different phones, either for yourself, your friends or, more likely, members of your family. This will allow you to control <em>who</em> has access to <em>what</em>; so if you don&rsquo;t want your children downloading inappropriate apps, you can implement the necessary safeguards.</p>
<p>Additionally, the enhancements to device sharing will allow you to log in to another smartphone running on Lollipop, so you can access your own contacts, messages and photos if needed.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>If Lollipop wasn&rsquo;t already sweet enough, it will be introducing Android Runtime that will allegedly deliver performance improvements (by up to four times!) to your smartphone.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The innovative new camera software will support full-resolution frames at 30 frames per second, as well as increased control over your camera sensor, lens and flash. Android 5.0 Lollipop will also include support for raw images.</p>
<h2>When can I download it?</h2>
<p>Sadly, Google hasn't yet confirmed a conclusive date as to when Android 5.0 Lollipop will become available for download. As previously cited, the Nexus 6 will be the debuting smartphone, although devices including the HTC One M8 and Motorola Moto G 4G are expected to get Lollipop before most others.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ll be able to pre-order the Nexus 6 presently. Later today, you'll be able to register your interest for email updates on availability.&nbsp;</strong></p>
