<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Honor 5X, arguably the best-looking budget phone on the market right now.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big claim, but I feel that it&rsquo;s justified.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/honor">Honor 5X</a> has to be in contention for the nicest-looking mobile phone within its price bracket. But not only is it a fantastic aesthetic achievement for the money invested, it&rsquo;s teaming with features that, like its looks, you&rsquo;d expect from much more costly handsets.</p>
<h2>Design 4/5</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question, Honor 5X is a desirable looking smartphone. Where similarly priced competition might have opted for cheaper, plastic materials, Honor 5X flaunts an all-metal design, fashioned from diamond-polished aluminium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s immediately reminiscent of some of the more premium options on the market, like HTC One M9. Though, admittedly, the quality doesn&rsquo;t quite match up. But that can hardly be taken as a criticism when you look at the difference in prices.</p>
<p>The back plate has an iridescent sort of sheen when caught in the light at different angles, and more of a brushed metal finish in others. <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/honor">Honor</a> has positioned the camera lens at the top, just above an elegantly unadorned fingerprint sensor, and artfully laser-etched its logo into the base of the plate, creating an overall impression of precision and grace.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/honor"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8833 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/5x-4.png" alt="5x-4" width="600" height="288" /></a></p>
<p>The lines of the device are quite sharp, which may not feel as comfortable as the chamfered edges of a mobile phone like iPhone 6S, but it ensures&nbsp;a more secure grip, that&rsquo;s only enhanced by the sandblasted sides, which creates a matted feel.</p>
<p>The power button and volume rocker sit along the right side of Honor 5X, where you&rsquo;d naturally expect to find them. And the left side is populated by a dual-SIM and microSD slot. Other than the positioning of the pin-release tray holes, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell the two apart, so you may occasionally forget which is which.</p>
<p>Honor 5X is available in five intriguing colours: sunset gold, dark grey and daybreak silver.</p>
<h2>Display 4/5</h2>
<p>Big and bold, the display on Honor 5X extends into phablet territory at 5.5-inches. But the Honor team didn't stop&nbsp;at <em>just</em>&nbsp;a grander scale, because the display also boasts an inspiring 1080p Full HD resolution and pixel density of 401 ppi. Thus, everything looks sharp and unspoilt by conspicuous pixels.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/honor"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8830 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/5x-1.png" alt="5x-1" width="600" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>The screen comes fully laminated to help protect it from scuffs, which is, granted,&nbsp;a&nbsp;fingerprint magnet. But it's a trade-off you should take without question because it&rsquo;s easier to rub away&nbsp;a smudge than it is a scratch.</p>
<p>The protective lamination can actually be removed, at your own peril...</p>
<p>The&nbsp;viewing angles on Honor 5X are good, making it easier to see content on the display&nbsp;when you&rsquo;re not facing it square on, or&nbsp;when multiple people are viewing it from different vantage points.</p>
<h2>Camera 3/5</h2>
<p>Honor 5X&rsquo;s 13-megapixel camera certainly packs plenty of detail, and is a great performer in well-lit situations. Sadly, the same can&rsquo;t be said for low-light conditions, where Honor 5X starts to struggle. The exclusion of a dual LED flash doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>
<p>Selfie performance is pretty impressive on its 5-megapixel front camera. Again, shots are rich in detail, and a beauty-enhancing feature helps iron out wrinkles and blemishes, because, let&rsquo;s face it, we don&rsquo;t want <em>too</em> much detail on the front&hellip;</p>
<p>If, like most people, your photos are more about retaining and looking back on memories, rather than trying to achieve especially arty and compelling results, then you&rsquo;ll find Honor 5X serves you just fine.</p>
<h2>Power 3/5</h2>
<p>Housing an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor (the same found in Motorola Moto X Play), Honor 5X guarantees a solid performance with little or no lag, and both apps and games are pretty quick to launch.</p>
<p>But you shouldn&rsquo;t expect it to perform and cope as well as the mobile phones sat at the top end of the market, because it won&rsquo;t. You have to remember that this is a budget Android device.</p>
<p>Battery life is encouraging. The 3000mAh power source can yield up to about a day and a half from moderate use. If you&rsquo;re particularly frugal, there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t squeeze up to two days of usage.</p>
<h2>Extra Features 4/5</h2>
<p>As I write this, there isn&rsquo;t a single other smartphone on the market in Honor 5X&rsquo;s price category that also wields&nbsp;a fingerprint reader. So in that respect, Honor 5X is totally unique.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re probably aware, the presence of a fingerprint scanner allows you to swiftly and securely unlock your device, using your trusty finger over potentially vulnerable passwords and four-digit codes. It&rsquo;s not entirely essential, but it&rsquo;s totally sweet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/honor"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8832 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/5x-3.png" alt="5x-3" width="600" height="340" /></a></p>
<p>The fingerprint sensor actually goes above and beyond an accessibility function, as it can be configured to perform other duties, like answering calls or taking photos.</p>
<p>As previously alluded to, Honor 5X is equipped with a dual-SIM tray as well as a slot for a microSD card. So you can insert both a personal and work SIM, and increase the storage capacity by up to 128GB.</p>
<h2>Price 5/5</h2>
<p>With prices starting from just &pound;13.00 a month, Honor 5X is undoubtedly one of the best value for money mobile phones you can buy. At what is pretty much the cheapest price point, you&rsquo;re providing yourself with a beautiful, Full HD smartphone, with decent cameras and a durable battery life.</p>
