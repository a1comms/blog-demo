<p>Looking for a brand new Samsung phone? The A-series may be just what you need.</p>
<p>These devices offer a range of awesome techy features along with a chic minimal look. There&rsquo;s just one problem &ndash;&nbsp;how do you choose which one is right for you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of each of the devices.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eW3yuqFebHs" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A10</h2>
<p>Sporting a completely immersive 6.2-inch Infinity-V display, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-a10-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy A10</a> is a gorgeous looking device.</p>
<p>The almost bezeless smartphone has a 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front camera which sits neatly in the centre at the top of the screen. As an added bonus, you&rsquo;ve also got a hefty 32GB storage and 3400 mAh battery. Put simply, it&rsquo;s a nice, pretty impressive, affordable device.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A20e</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-a20e-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy A20e</a> also has 32GB storage but its camera game is more impressive. On the rear, you&rsquo;ve got a 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel Ultra Wide Camera while the front is an 8-megapixel setup. Plus, there&rsquo;s a Selfie focus feature that allows you to blend the background, making for awesome snaps.</p>
<p>When it comes to the screen, there&rsquo;s a 5.8-inch Infinity-V display which is plenty of space for playing back videos and a rear fingerprint scanner. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a 3000 mAh battery too, so you can keep going all day long. Great stuff.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A40</h2>
<p>Kicking things up a notch, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-a40-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy A40</a> has a whopping 64GB storage, a 3D stunning Glasstic back, and a 5.9-inch Infinity-V display. There&rsquo;s a dual setup on the rear featuring a 16-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel Ultra Wide Camera and Scene Optimiser tech.</p>
<p>On the front, though, there&rsquo;s an ever better 25-megapixel selfie camera. The battery should last all day with a 3100 mAh pack. When it comes to security, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve also got the snazzy rear fingerprint scanner.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A50</h2>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s take a moment to look at the Samsung Galaxy A50. This stellar smartphone packs not one, not two, but three rear cameras. There&rsquo;s an Ultra Wide Camera, a 25-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel Depth Camera.

<p>The selfie camera is nothing to sniff at either with a 25-megapixel lens. You should be able to take some pretty astounding selfies with this one. When it comes to the screen, you&rsquo;ve got a 6.4-inch display with an On-Screen Fingerprint scanner.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A70</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the screen with the Samsung Galaxy A70. The smartphone offers a huge 6.7-inch Infinity U-display. Things don&rsquo;t end there. You&rsquo;ve also got a super powerful 4500 mAh battery pack and 128GB storage. It is certainly a high-end phone. The device has dual-SIM capacity along with superfast charging and an On-Screen Fingerprint too.</p>
<p>The triple camera setup on the rear has an Ultra Wide Camera, a 32-megapixel camera and 5-megapixel Depth Camera. There&rsquo;s the Scene Optimiser tech too, which uses AI. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s the 32-megapixel selfie camera which means that you will always get the perfect shot.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A80</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about the beast that is the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-a80-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy A80</a>. This phone is now on pre-order where you can receive a FREE pair of AKG headphones (ending 18th July) and may just blow the other A-series phones out of the water.</p>
<p>It sports a massive 6.7-inch New Infinity Display along with a cool almost bezeless look. The camera setup is sure to be awesome, boasting a rotating camera lens and an Ultra Wide Camera lens.</p>

<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough to tempt you, the storage is pretty epic too, with 128GB RAM. There&rsquo;s also the fingerprint scanner on the rear, Superfast charge and a whole load more that&rsquo;s yet to be announced. It&rsquo;s sure to be out shortly, so watch this space.</p>
