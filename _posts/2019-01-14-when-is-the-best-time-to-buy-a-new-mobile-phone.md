<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s all about great timing!</span></p>
<p>So, when is the best time to buy a new phone? We all wonder don&rsquo;t we, should I upgrade to the latest handset right now or wait a little bit? You never know when there&rsquo;s a new phone around the corner or any price changes.</p>
<p>Well, fear not, we&rsquo;re here to give you a helping hand in this scenario. Here&rsquo;s a few pointers as to when you should look to get your new mobile phone, whether Android or iPhone.</p>
<h2>When to Buy a New iPhone</h2>
<p>The world-renowned Apple event is on everyone&rsquo;s calendar. What will the tech giant bring out next? It goes without saying these are highly anticipated events.</p>
<p>What you need to know here is that the latest iOS is usually discussed in June along with other Apple tech announcements.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s September event usually includes the latest iPhone and all its capabilities. Of course, it&rsquo;s always better than the previous years. These events will be a great starter if you&rsquo;re after a new iPhone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to see the latest device and compare its features against the previous model. This will most likely help you make up your mind.&nbsp;So, make sure you&rsquo;ve got September marked down in your calendar as a potential new phone time!</p>

<h2>When to Buy a New Android</h2>
<p>Similar to Apple, there&rsquo;s a new Android operating system released every year, boasting design and functionality improvements focused on making our smartphone lives easier.</p>
<p>These announcements tend to come at the end of summer, meaning phones released after this time should have the latest software on. So, that&rsquo;s one thing to consider, do I need to latest mobile software?</p>
<p>Another is that with Android, there are several brands releasing new mobile phones regularly, from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei</a>&nbsp;in March/April,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a>&nbsp;in February/March and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, who are a bit less predictable, announcing new phones in February/March or August/September.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll come to find there&rsquo;s always loads of choice throughout the year!</p>
<p>Similarly, you can see which new phones are being released, and easily compare the models to find out which is the one for you, right here on Blog.Buymobiles.net.</p>
<h2>Do I Actually Need a New Phone?</h2>
<p>As iPhone and Android devices get more advanced, you won&rsquo;t be able to get the best of the latest operating systems and features on older Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Simply put, if your current phone becomes too old, this means they&rsquo;ll struggle with more tasks as technology moves forward, and let&rsquo;s face it, who wants a slow phone&hellip; #BufferFace.</p>

<p>Even though upgrading your operating system can sometimes make it feel like a different mobile altogether, ultimately, there will come a point when you need to take the plunge and get a new phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that older phone models usually drop in price too after newer models are released. So if you had your eye on a previous model, this would be the best time to buy your new phone.</p>
<p>Compare the market! No, we don&rsquo;t mean Aleksandr Meerkat, but it&rsquo;s worth checking out the latest models against the old ones, and see which has all the gear you want, such as wireless charging.</p>

<h2>Will I Get a Better Deal if I Buy at Launch?</h2>
<p>Most leading manufacturers bring out at least one new phone model per year, with the likes of <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> launching its new flagship devices to the world. But, should you always buy the latest model, and when?</p>
<p>Often, when new phones are released, there&rsquo;s usually a benefit to buying early, like more data or a giveaway, be it only for a limited time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these market leading handsets that often have very competitive deals at launch too, so is a great time to buy a new phone and get a sweet deal.</p>

<h2>Should I Upgrade?</h2>
<p>This is an exciting time for most people, you just come into your upgrade period and go bonkers at the prospect of a new phone. However, do you ask yourself, should I keep my existing model or upgrade?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d be silly not to, after all, a lot can change in two years! Depending when your contract deal is up, there could have been two new devices released.</p>

<h2>Where Can I Save the Most Money?</h2>
<p>In the mobile phone market, pay monthly prices can change as the days and weeks go by. So, is there a sweet spot? Well in theory, not really.</p>
<p>Of course, older generation models will naturally become cheaper with time, but that&rsquo;s hardly convenient if you need a new phone now. Prices on handsets will change regularly and often have some other perk assigned to them (i.e. data promotions) when they&rsquo;re new.</p>
<p>So, if there is a rule here, get it when you see it, to avoid disappointment and get a better deal in the long run.</p>
<h2>Ask Friends and Family</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, there&rsquo;s nothing better than a solid recommendation from a friend or relative.</p>

<h2>One Last Thing To Remember</h2>
<p>Ultimately, if you see an amazing deal, get it! They don&rsquo;t hang around forever and prices can go up or down. Another thing to consider is that the phone may become discontinued if it's an older Android or iPhone, so avoid heartache and buy it before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
