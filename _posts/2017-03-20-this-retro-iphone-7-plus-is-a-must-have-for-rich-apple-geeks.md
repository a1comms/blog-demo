<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Feeling nostalgic? ColorWare has just released the best new, old phone. Meet iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a diehard Apple fan, you&rsquo;re certain to adore all products &ndash; old and new &ndash; designed by your favourite brand. From the now seemingly ancient Macintosh of the 1980s, to the ultra-suave iPhone 7 of today, Apple has come a long way since it began in a mere garage workshop.</p>
<p>Many fans have followed the tale of Apple from start to finish and it&rsquo;s fair to say that it&rsquo;s been a whirlwind-ride for gadget-lovers around the globe. We may be blessed with some of the greatest technology known to man right now, but what if you&rsquo;ve a penchant for eras gone by? &nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you could have all the slick features of modern technology in retro casing and design?</p>
<p>Now you can.</p>
<p>In fact, ColorWare has just released a <a href="http://www.colorware.com/p-744-colorware-iphone-7-plus-retro.aspx" target="_blank">retro iPhone 7 Plus</a> that gives users everything they want: a classic design with modern-day functions. The customised phone is reminiscent of the 1980s Macintosh computers which were revolutionary when they first launched.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s well worth a look at this combination of retro design and modern technology, even if the price tag is a little hefty (see below). The iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition includes a beige paint job, complete with the original rainbow Apple logo. There are also darker stripes adorning the sides of the gadget, much like the Macintosh once had.</p>

<p>So, how did the masters at ColorWare create a phone that <em>looks </em>like an old Macintosh but still works like a modern iPhone 7? Well, luckily, they went ahead and explained the process to the world in a statement. Here&rsquo;s what the company had to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ColorWare, the product goes through a labor intensive process of disassembly, cleaning, masking, painting and inspection. Then, the product is buffed and reassembled. The product goes through final inspection and is packaged into the original packaging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to get your hands on a retro iPhone 7 Plus, it&rsquo;ll cost you a chunky $1,899 (around <strong>&pound;1,530</strong>). The first 25 that are sold will come with &lsquo;a number of authenticity.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll have to be fast, these retro editions are available for a limited time only.</p>
