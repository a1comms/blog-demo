<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Need a helping hand getting your finances in order? These five money saving apps could help.</span></p>
<p>We all wish we could have more money when the end of the month rolls around. If you always find that you&rsquo;re out of cash before payday, you need to change your ways.</p>
<p>Managing money is easier said than done, but luckily, there are a handful of apps to guide you along the way. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how to hang on to those fun coupons.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15385" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nwQm1Oob33LfUHWRl9o_e8Y9ScZkkg_dkNpYwRPpXfxwswCQm-UntN3gd0OlTyFpP_opbD3Jwbj-q2lKKVfB7ZcisQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>1) Moneybox</h2>
<p>What do you do with your spare change? Let&rsquo;s say you buy a coffee for &pound;2.50, and use three individual pound coins to pay, where does that extra 50p go? The chances are it ends up in the bottom of your bag, purse, or pocket. Maybe you stick it in the back of your jeans and forget all about it. It&rsquo;s a waste. But, what if you could make sure that your extra cash went towards something for the future?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Moneybox comes into the picture. You link your main bank card to the app and the next time you make a purchase, it rounds up the sum to the nearest pound. The app then lets you invest in companies such as Netflix and Disney using your small change.</p>
<p><em>Check out and download on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id1049797239?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moneyboxapp&amp;referrer=af_tranid%3DJQM1tnf2si866a-_Rx3oVg%26pid%3DWebsite%26c%3DPlayStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</em></p>

<h2>2) Penny</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here. Keeping track of your finances is hard. If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who avoids checking their balance and hopes that everything will be okay, here&rsquo;s the app for you.</p>
<p>Penny is an AI bot app that sends you messages about the state of your fiscal situation. For example, the app may send you a message about what upcoming bills you have or how much you&rsquo;ve spent today.</p>
<p>While, sure, it may be easier to live with your head in the sand, it&rsquo;s far better to stay on top of your money. That way, you know how much you can spend guilt free and what you really should be storing away for that rainy day.</p>
<p><em>Check out and download on&nbsp;iOS and Google Play.</em></p>

<h2>3) Squirrel</h2>
<p>Talking of storing away cash, have you heard about Squirrel? This app makes budgeting easier than ever before. When your money comes into your bank account, it splits it into different pots. You have a pot for savings, one for your bills, and a weekly allowance. There&rsquo;s no way that you can spend more than you should as everything is plain and simple.</p>
<p>If you have a problem figuring out how much you should be saving for the likes of bills and general things, this could be the app for you. (Oh, it has the cutest name too!)</p>
<p><em>Check out and download on iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.squirrel.squirrel_mobile&amp;utm_source=squirrel&amp;utm_campaign=website_footer&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;_branch_match_id=451045286698244243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</em></p>

<h2>4) Bean</h2>
<p>And now, for the app that says it can save you an average of &pound;672 per year. You may not realise it right now, but you could be seriously overpaying for your bills and subscription fees.</p>
<p>For instance, you may be paying &pound;9.99 per month for Spotify. But, if your partner is doing the same, you could both save money by switching to a family account. The account costs around &pound;15, which means that you save a fiver between you each month.</p>
<p>These small and simple savings all add up and could mean that you have way more disposable income each month. When the app has found you a better deal, it can also help you switch in just minutes. Nothing could be easier.</p>

<h2>5) Mint</h2>
<p>Do you ever look at your bank balance and wonder where all your money has gone? You&rsquo;re not alone. The Mint app helps you change that.</p>
<p>You have to link the app up to all your accounts before you begin. When you&rsquo;ve done that, it will give you a quick snapshot of your spending and finances. You can also check your credit score, your net worth, and your investments at the touch of a button. If you&rsquo;re serious about saving, Mint could be the way forward for you.</p>
