<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Peeved mobile&nbsp;users are complaining that Facebook is guzzling excessive amounts of their iPhone battery, even when it&rsquo;s not in use.</span></p>
<p>It seems that the social networking app is recording long periods of &lsquo;Background Activity&rsquo;, even for users who&rsquo;ve turned background refresh off.</p>
<p>A post from MacRumors revealed that one user has seen Facebook exhaust a particularly greedy 39% of their iPhone&rsquo;s battery life.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you close the app down, or turn off background refresh, it appears Facebook is up to something. iOS developer, Matt Galligan, puts this down to location tracking.</p>
<p>So what Facebook could be doing, if you&rsquo;ve enabled location tracking, is performing &ldquo;ridiculous amounts of analytics&rdquo; in the background, thus draining battery levels at an uncomfortable rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is Facebook tracking my location?&rdquo; I hear you ask.</p>
<p>With your permission, Facebook quietly, but continually, logs your location data, creating a history of your visited places.</p>
<p>For the user, this means you can &lsquo;check-in&rsquo; to places, and show off to your mates that you&rsquo;re having way more fun than they are.</p>
<p>For Facebook, this data could be used for ad targeting and more accurate profiling. Amongst other things, perhaps&hellip;</p>
<p>To bottleneck the rate at which you&rsquo;re losing power, and abate your&nbsp;paranoia of being under &lsquo;surveillance&rsquo;, you can disable location services in your Settings > Privacy.</p>
<p>We don't think that will solve all of your Facebook related battery woes, but it might help.</p>
<p>You'll be glad to know, however, that Facebook has at least acknowledged the issue, and looks to be working on resolving it, after releasing the following statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We have heard reports of some people experiencing battery issues with our iOS app. We&rsquo;re looking into this and hope to have a fix in place soon.&rdquo;</strong></p>
