<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s time to get nostalgic&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Strap in folks, we&rsquo;re about to shoot back to a time when mobile phones were pretty funky looking, and pretty much all you could do was call or text your loved ones!</p>
<p>There aren't that many manufacturers like Samsung, of course, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/10-nokia-mobile-phones-you-cant-believe-existed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nokia goes without saying</a>, responsible for its fair share of wacky smartphones. Feast your eyes on these classic throwbacks.</p>
<h2>1) Samsung GT-B7330</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18268" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CurOOesUtO4wf9A-a_S-D6IpwzgxGPFDxiaL7v8DR1teUPC6x0-NvrtxrAhKd89zxmMJvGnaA2WKsnx9T21fhIr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Is that a BlackBerry...? Oh no, wait, it&rsquo;s just Samsung attempt of one, launched back in 2009. Nearly 10 years old, (where did the time go?) when this doozey launched it was no doubt trying to jump on the BlackBerry bandwagon. Known as the Omnia Pro B7330, it had a QWERTY keyboard, a Windows operating system (yes, <em>Windows</em>), 2.62-inches of pure screen and to finish it off, 3.5G internet on-the-go. Nice.</p>
<h2>2) Samsung GT-B2100</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18274" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KimBtVpP0Rvb0zWqvq1_G7pQs-m5WUKtV0mfhiHQfYOrd-L0HakWaRWalNX2Z9C6hBKgLo_gEbRAfA4c1gMJY50=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Samsung must have been throwing phones out the door faster than Road Runner on a litre of Lucozade (other fizzy drinks are available) back in 2009. This GT-B2100 phone was nearly a whole 2cm in thickness and came with a whopping 1000 mAh battery, which at the time, would have lasted about a two years. Nowadays though, mobiles are way much more!</p>
<h2>3) Samsung GT-B5310</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18261" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UEiKxjg9_HhAo-jZ0SH-BbGb5f6VkFByp1e0mH3fxBalURHUP0E7QPHQuq7z5uX8fVW5AGTCOj1MkaG1IFLh5-0=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>This rather dashing device was another of Samsung&rsquo;s releases in 2009. The phone came with a popular (at the time) QWERTY keyboard which was revealed by sliding open your phone. Meaning, you could use this little gem on its side for extra rapid messaging. It came with space for 1000 contacts, was WiFi-enabled and even bossed a 3.15-megapixel camera. Think of the pics you&rsquo;d have got on that bad boy! Not bad to say the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-samsung-galaxy-note-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest Note release</a> has a dual lens 12-megapixel shooter.</p>
<h2>4) Samsung GT-B3410</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18260" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z7xV6yHnz-DisH-SnFVXTwp-loiGhUTW1lvoLFHeO-OKr5HKO_4C900Y5IacKJ6KnTWn6aDE64WUHd4E9KgL2xA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>This Samsung, yet another release from 2009, sports a 2-megapixel camera with 4x optical zoom. With its sliding keyboard, it was best used on its side to get the most of its massive 2.6-inch screen! One downside though was the 960 mAh battery that only lasted 18 months!</p>
<h2>5) Samsung GT-S8500</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18264" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mhgx3pz4hXNJ5_0eZJ6vSOsbxUaLNRUmqnjZiJaOzsWXsjT4xTGqZn-4tyMPiGkw3afOV3Wi9xz8GMuZ4f5BScM=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Switching up its phone design in 2010, this GT model had a glossy Super AMOLED display and a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass screen with anti-smudge coating (it&rsquo;s all getting pretty high tech now from Samsung). The battery got bigger too, boasting a 1500 mAh battery (not too shabby may we add bearing in mind it was 2010). Along with a 5-megapixel shooter, you got a fair bit of stuff on this Samsung mobile.</p>
<p><span class="" style="font-size: 23px; color: #444444;">Next: Even more nostalgia...&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>6) Samsung GT-S5350 Shark</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18262" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W0dYKVYDgMDHs9lJBCQQCXONfLasHJxIYlBZUKK2t8003ExHXGalLNWWffxt2SCxHt7lC2PXYfCU6ek9EOaC4Nu4TQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another of Samsung&rsquo;s 2010 releases looks more like a house phone than anything else. No doubt bang on trend for the time, this monster may well have been owned by you or someone you know. It came with a 900 mAh battery, a single 3.1-megapixel camera and video shooting. You could also listen to those MP3 tunes aloud, however it didn&rsquo;t have a headphone jack (we&rsquo;ve not progressed that far yet).</p>
<h2>7) Monte GT-S5620</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18265" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3rvv35LGe9NKSbYMaHLO2cCPkgaeEywkZ3q58HrW6L7Q4VvzahrWgfmFC2O2shZJQUOxTF1WaZ1jtaUFz82Lsx0ZDQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Monte mobile from Samsung is starting to sway toward the more modern smartphone look we&rsquo;re used to today. Yet another 2010 release (yes, another!) saw more advancements in design and features, not to mention strides in the 'all-screen' department. A 3-inch display and room for 2000 contacts was no doubt the draw of this phone. The Monte came with a headphone jack and a 1000 mAh battery too.</p>
<h2>8) Samsung GT-I5700 Galaxy Spica</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18272" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F3LIrKcAhZbh49trDpSQCF7Af3rNf6y8-S39IcqWGn4U8z7nsU8kg6gNTBYziT5UaV5b2KYbEY9ZAeEAJnb1J80=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Just look at that clock graphic! This Samsung device launched in 2009 packed with all the gear we could have wanted back then.</p>
<p>A touch screen setup on this device was a step in the right direction, in a time when the keyboard/touchscreen trend was still in limbo. Luckily, we accepted the touchscreen as well as the Android operating system. The I5700 came with Android version 1.5 cupcake (we&rsquo;re now on 8.1 Oreo), a whole 3.2-megapixels of camera, a 1500 mAh battery and a headphone jack. This was a phone with all the gear, back when we had no idea!</p>
<h2>9) Samsung GT-S7070 Diva</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18263" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jubew1D2AnkxljANcoYq9xh6RSF5vBZFtV8KvyCevu4QPpEHSENxUJgdxVscOgbduA9SmxbDMrH3ADrr-LVa8iU=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>This Samsung mobile from 2010 (which let&rsquo;s face it, seemed like only last week), has a touchscreen setup and a seriously groovy designed back (it looks like something from the Eden Project).</p>
<p>You got a huge 2.8-inch screen, a 3-megapixel camera - for all your photo and video needs - and a 960 mAh battery (which seemed to be the battery size of the time according to this list). It was good to know we were producing phones of this calibre even then; look how far we&rsquo;ve come in 8 years! It&rsquo;s scary stuff.</p>
<h2>10) Samsung GT-I8000 Omnia II</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18258" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gu3xbUXd3ZYkJGPPpUtwtNap6yjvJdCAqu_yrXymkJp_MlXFTJ7tq83btlRqNcr9x_Xk-0fsklkTJD8IExlB2Uo_=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>This multimedia Samsung smartphone was release in 2009 running a Windows Mobile operating system (you know, the old days when Windows on phones were popular). This GT-I8000 handset came with a 5-megapixel camera, a step-up from the others released around this time. It was a step-up in the screen department too, sporting a 3.7-inch AMOLED screen with a Stylus Pen.</p>
<p>So, there you have it, a swift visit to the days of yesteryear, where keyboards and sliding phones were still a thing. Thanks for the 00&rsquo;s Samsung, but we're glad how you turned out!</p>
