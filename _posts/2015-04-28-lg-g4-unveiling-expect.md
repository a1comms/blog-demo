<p><span class="postStandFirst">The day of LG G4&rsquo;s official unveiling is already upon us, with the tech company set to introduce its latest flagship mobile to the world at 16:00 GMT. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6612 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/LG-G4-Countdown-1024x586.png" alt="LG G4 Countdown" width="960" height="549" /></p>
<p>If LG is anything, it&rsquo;s consistently radical. Through its LG G2 and LG G3, we&rsquo;ve seen avant-garde features emerge like the refined rear key, stunning Quad HD display and Laser Auto Focus camera. So it feels reasonable to assert that we&rsquo;re expecting big things this time around, in LG G4.</p>
<p>And considering the recent launch of HTC One M9, Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, all of which are being lauded by the critics, it has never been more imperative that LG follows its usual trend, by pulling something spectacular out of the bag&hellip;</p>
<p>Going by the myriad of leaks, rumours and official confirmations, we&rsquo;re bracing ourselves for LG to do just that.</p>
<h2>Big camera focus</h2>
<p>LG&rsquo;s teasers thus far are heavily suggestive of a new and improved camera unit, which is rumoured to come in&nbsp;at 16-megapixels. Promos have revealed that it will feature a F1.8 aperture that will improve low-light performance considerably. It&rsquo;s said that it&rsquo;ll capture 80% more light than LG G3.</p>
<p>The camera sensor will be able to automatically determine whether you&rsquo;re taking a shot indoors or outside, which will go a long way in producing accurate colours that really standout.</p>
<p>Much like a high-quality professional camera, LG G4&rsquo;s unit will boast manual controls for advanced photography. You&rsquo;ll be able to adjust various aspects like ISO, white balance and even shutter speed by up to 30 seconds in length.</p>

<p>LG has even coaxed professional shutterbug Colby Brown into showing off the new camera features on LG G4, which you can see for yourself in the video below.</p>

<h2>Leather Back</h2>
<p>If the sewn leather invite wasn&rsquo;t enough of a clue, the recent leaks surely have been. LG G4 will be available in two variants: what looks like a plastic model, and of course an offbeat leather clad one. The rear covers will be removable, allowing you to chop and change, and access the battery and microSD card slot, which is said to support up to 128GB.</p>
<h2>Quad HD Display</h2>
<p>Much like the G3, LG has equipped LG G4 with a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, though it's likely to flaunt various upgrades to the technology behind it, making it thinner and brighter, with an improved colour gamut, touch sensitivity, contrast ratio and energy efficiency.</p>
<h2>LG UX 4.0</h2>
<p>The new-fangled LG G4 will naturally be powered by Android Lollipop, and further complimented by LG&rsquo;s own updated UX 4.0 software.</p>
<p>LG has labelled UX 4.0 as the &lsquo;human-centric UX&rsquo; that&rsquo;s much simpler and easier to use. It&rsquo;ll be lighter than previous iterations, equipped with only the essentials. Features like Smart Bulletin and Smart Notice are back, and apps like Calendar and Gallery have been enhanced.</p>
<p>LG UX 4.0 will introduce Quick Shot to its users, which enables swift photo taking by double tapping the rear key &ndash; even when the display&rsquo;s sleeping. It&rsquo;s much quicker than launching the camera app, which will be handy for those moments when the magic is gone in the blink of an eye.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Other Specs</h2>
<p>LG G4 is reportedly being sized up at 149.1 x 75.3 x 8.9 mm, which makes it marginally taller and wider than LG G3, but matched in depth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely to house a 3000mAh battery, which is the minimum a device like LG G4 requires, with a power-thirsty Quad HD display such as the one it'll sport.</p>
<p>There are still shrouds of mist obscuring LG G4&rsquo;s processor, with various rumours pointing at different speeds. But we can say fairly confidently that you&rsquo;ll see a 64-bit chip.</p>
<p><strong>At this stage, we are <em>more</em> than happy settling for one or two&nbsp;misgivings, since the official announcement is less than four hours away. You&rsquo;ll want to stay tuned for more updates once the veil is finally lifted, at 16:00 GMT today.</strong></p>
