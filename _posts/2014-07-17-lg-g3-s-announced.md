<p><span class="postStandFirst">LG has announced a new mid-range phone, a slimmed down version of the LG G3 called the LG G3 S. With decent mid-range specs and a lovely big 5-inch screen (not to mention a camera that uses the same &ldquo;Laser Focus&rdquo; as its big sibling), the LG G3 S could well be one of the nicest mid-range phones we&rsquo;ve ever seen!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4620" alt="LG G3 S" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/LG-G3-S1.jpg" width="500" height="481" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a trend in recent times, where manufacturers have released &lsquo;mini&rsquo; versions of their flagship devices, to tap into the mid-range market. We&rsquo;ve seen HTC do it, and Samsung, but the newest mid-ranger from LG, while <i>technically</i> being a &lsquo;mini&rsquo; phone when compared to the full-sized and utterly phenomenal LG G3, really stretches the definition of the term.</p>
<p>According to the LG Newsroom, it&rsquo;s called the LG G3 Beat, although it will be called the LG G3 S when it arrives in Europe. Quite frankly, it&rsquo;s hard to think of it as being a mini <i>anything</i>, when it has a 5-inch screen (which is, to be honest, probably why LG chose <i>not</i> to use the name &lsquo;Mini&rsquo;).</p>
<p>And yet, despite that, thanks to the thin bezels that LG uses on its newest phones, the LG G3 S is only a <i>mite</i> bigger than the HTC One Mini 2 (itself a mini version of the HTC One M8), even with that 5-inch screen. It also includes the specifications you would expect from a mid-ranger, with a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor, 1GB of RAM, and an 8MP camera.</p>
<p>However, while the resolution is lower, the LG G3 S does share one camera-based feature with its big sibling, the LG G3. That feature is Laser Focus, which uses infrared light to drastically reduce the time it takes for the camera to focus on any particular object in shot.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, it will all come down to price. If the LG G3 S can hit a nice, low price, then we could be looking at another contender for a classic mid-ranger, here.&nbsp;</strong></p>
