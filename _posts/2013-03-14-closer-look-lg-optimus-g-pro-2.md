<p><span class="postStandFirst">Announced at this year's Mobile World Congress event the LG Optimus G Pro certainly stood out from the crowd - We take a look at what makes it so special.</span></p>
<p>Many people have said that this year&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress was a different beast to previous years, with so&nbsp;<em>few</em>&nbsp;flagship phones being unveiled by big names such as Sony, HTC or Samsung.</p>
<p>There was one superstar phone unveiled, however, and most people have come to agree that it was the star of the show. That phone is the&nbsp;LG Optimus G Pro, and most seem to agree that it is so impressive, it manages to single-handedly make up for the lack of any other flagships!</p>
<p>But why is that? Why did the LG Optimus G Pro steal the show?</p>
<p>&bull; The first factor is its screen, a 5.5inch 1080p display that puts the LG Optimus G Pro firmly in the &lsquo;phablet&rsquo; category, alongside the undisputed champion of that class, the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note II. The fact that the screen has a 1080p resolution means that it looks considerably sharper than any of its rivals. Therefore, when looking at why this phone stole the show, the screen is reason one.</p>
<p>&bull; Reason two is the processor, because the LG Optimus G Pro comes complete with a 1.7GHz quad-core processor. However, it is the same&nbsp;<em>next-gen</em>&nbsp;Snapdragon 600 processor found in the recently unveiled HTC One, and what this means is that the LG Optimus G Pro is fast.&nbsp;<em>Blisteringly</em>&nbsp;fast, in fact, as benchmark tests for the LG Optimus G Pro seem to indicate that it&rsquo;s faster than any other phone on the market!</p>
<p>&bull; Reason three is the camera, which comes in at 13 megapixels, the same resolution as the Sony Xperia Z. Pin-sharp photos will be no problem with this phone, and it&rsquo;s also capable of recording 1080p video.</p>
<p>&bull; The final reason is something that&rsquo;s possibly a little bit &lsquo;nerdier&rsquo;, as it were; in an industry where fewer&nbsp;manufacturers are giving their phones removable batteries and microSD slots, the LG Optimus G Pro is one of only a handful of top-end phones that includes those two things. Not only that, but it also comes with 32GB of internal storage, in addition to the microSD slot, and the battery itself is&nbsp;<em>huge</em>. The battery&rsquo;s capacity is, in fact, 3140 mAh, so despite the LG Optimus G Pro being an incredibly powerful phone, that power does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;come with the cost of a short battery life.</p>
<p>Those four reasons are why the LG Optimus G Pro stole the show in Barcelona. It truly is an astonishing phone, with bags and bags of power, and on top of the hardware specs, it also comes with Android Jelly Bean, straight out of the box, which brings such benefits as Google Now and Voice Search.</p>
<p>So far, 2013 is turning out to be an exciting year, for mobile phones; there have been some&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;impressive handsets unveiled so far, and we&rsquo;ve already seen a couple of contenders for the coveted title of &lsquo;phone of the year&rsquo; (with one more still to be unveiled, the&nbsp;<em>highly</em>&nbsp;anticipated&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4).</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not unfair to say that the LG Optimus G Pro may well have a shot at taking that title; it really is&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;good!</strong></p>
