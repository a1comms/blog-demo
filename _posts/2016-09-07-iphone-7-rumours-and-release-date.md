<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Updated 07/09/16 - Today's the day!&nbsp;Find out how to watch the Apple iPhone 7 event live.</span></p>
<p><em>When will it be announced? What will it be called? Is Apple terminating the headphone jack? Will it actually be waterproof? What new features can we expect?</em></p>
<p>These are just some of the iPhone 7 questions being asked online, all of which (and more) we&rsquo;ll explore in this iPhone 7 rumours and release date piece.</p>
<p>So relax, you&rsquo;re in the right place for all the latest iPhone gossip. We&rsquo;re keeping this thread updated with any new rumours, so this really is the only destination you need to visit.</p>
<p>With the interim iPhone 6s launching in 2015, everybody&rsquo;s expecting bigger things from Apple this year, in the form of an updated look and feel, along with some killer features to accompany.</p>
<h2>How to watch the Apple iPhone 7 event live</h2>
<p>My invite to Apple's iPhone event seems to have disappeared in the post, so like millions of other adoring Apple fans, I'll be streaming the event live today.</p>
<p>As always, it's free to do, you just need to own a qualifying device. The list includes an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, a Mac with Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later, or, finally one for the outsiders, a PC with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Just head to <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's US site</a>&nbsp;to watch the event, which starts 18:00 GMT.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 official name</h2>
<p>Whilst there's been plenty of debate over what Apple will name the larger of its upcoming&nbsp;iPhones, with the general consensus settling on iPhone 7 Plus, rather than iPhone 7 Pro, there haven't been many, if any, questions raised to contest whether or not it would be the '7'. Until now that is, after reports surfaced on a Chinese manufacturer site suggesting that Apple's next device could be called iPhone 6SE and iPhone 6SE Plus / Pro.</p>
<p>Our gut-feeling is that this won't be the case. Apple will want its next launch to cause a lot of buzz, and having released an incremental update last year, in iPhone 6s, another SE variant just doesn't feel right.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 release date</h2>
<p>We finally have official word on iPhone 7's release date, now&nbsp;Apple has sent out&nbsp;press invitations,&nbsp;teasing&nbsp;an event scheduled for Wednesday&nbsp;7th September 18:00 GMT.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11361" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/Apple-Event.png" alt="Apple Event" width="600" height="494" /></p>
<p>It's not yet possible&nbsp;to confirm&nbsp;when iPhone 7 will start shipping, but based on previous years, we expect&nbsp;the week starting 12th September is the one to watch out for.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Design</h2>
<p>The next iPhone, or <em>iPhones</em> rather, are presumed as iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus&nbsp;(or iPhone 7 <em>Pro</em>, in some circles), and are indeed set to introduce a fresh design.</p>
<p>How fresh, is a matter of opinion, but from online sources it looks like the antenna strips have been relocated to the very top and bottom of iPhone 7, and the headphone jack appears to have been removed altogether, resulting in a cleaner look.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11207" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/iPhone-6-design.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 design" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>Apple is said to be building support for headphones into the charging port, which means your standard 3.5mm ones won&rsquo;t fit without an adapter of some sort.</p>
<p>Two new colour options could be available, after rumours suggesting Apple may introduce Space Black and Blue models emerged. But perhaps the most interesting report is the one claiming that iPhone 7 may even by waterproof.</p>
<p>The latest rumour concerning the iPhone 7 design claims the physical home button is being replaced by a pressure-sensitive, haptic&nbsp;sensor, meaning the area could be used for multiple commands.</p>

<h2>iPhone 7 Display</h2>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much demand for Apple to change the size of its flagship iPhones, so we expect iPhone 7 to sport a 4.7-inch display, and iPhone 7 Plus a 5.5-inch.</p>
<p>Some sources are claiming, however, that iPhone 7 will boast an upgraded resolution from 750p to 1080p. Now that Quad HD is becoming pretty standard among competing Android flagships, it makes sense that Apple would bump the pixels up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11206" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/apple_iphone_6_and_6plus_.jpg" alt="apple_iphone_6_and_6plus_" width="600" height="322" /></p>
<p>As for iPhone 7 Plus, we haven&rsquo;t come across many rumours that suggest anything higher than a 1080p resolution.</p>
<h2>iPhone 7 Camera</h2>
<p>Rumours surrounding iPhone 7&rsquo;s camera have been totally conflicting. More so than with any other feature, so predicting this one could be tricky.</p>
<p>If you look at track record, Apple tends to stick with the same megapixel count for at least a couple of generations, whilst improving the lens and supporting software. In which case, we would back a 12-megapixel camera on both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11205" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/iphone-6-camera.jpg" alt="iphone 6 camera" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>However, leaked images purport that the lens itself will be larger, thus allowing more light into shots, improving performance in dark conditions.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, some sources are stating that&nbsp;iPhone 7 is in line for a bump in camera spec to 16-megapixels, and&nbsp;iPhone 7 Plus&nbsp;is set to feature a dual-lens camera for some enhanced photo wizardry.</p>
<h2>Other iPhone 7 rumours</h2>
<p>Both handsets will of course feature faster processors and GPUs, possibly along with enhanced finger print scanners &ndash; although this was updated last year.</p>
<p>You can bet they&rsquo;ll need bigger batteries, NFC (possibly just for Apple Pay) and, hopefully, storage upgrades. We pray this is the year Apple finally scraps 16GB iPhones.</p>

<p>Another particularly exciting&nbsp;iPhone 7 rumour&nbsp;concerns the larger Plus, in that it may feature a smart connector, like the one seen on the recent iPad Pro. It&rsquo;s essentially a magnetic dock that allows accessories to be connected with ease. Could this be Apple&rsquo;s method of adding modules?</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s worth stating that we&rsquo;ve had no official word from Apple on any of this, and have compiled all information from online sources. As always, take these rumours with a healthy pinch of salt.</strong></p>
