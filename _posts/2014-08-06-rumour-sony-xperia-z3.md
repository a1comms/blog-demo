<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">Rumours have appeared online, which suggest that a new Sony superphone is on the way. It&rsquo;s called the Sony Xperia Z3X, and if the rumours are accurate, it will be super-powerful, with a super-high-res screen and a 22MP camera, and it will have add-on lenses and microphones, to try and court photography and film-making enthusiasts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4585" alt="xperia-z2-gallery-05-waterproof-super-durable-1240x840-e7a7800851058db44b43a4da0a970888" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/xperia-z2-gallery-05-waterproof-super-durable-1240x840-e7a7800851058db44b43a4da0a970888-1024x608.jpg" width="576" height="342" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">The Sony Xperia Z2 caused quite a stir with it's incredible underwater photography cababilities</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already heard rumours that the follow-up to the brilliant Sony Xperia Z2 (the cunningly-named Sony Xperia Z3) is due to launched later in the year, but if recent rumours are true, it seems that there might be an even <i>more</i> high-end Sony smartphone on the way.</p>
<p>According to G4Games, it will be called the Sony Z3X, and its list of specifications is, quite frankly, mouth-watering.</p>
<p>The first key feature, if the rumour is indeed accurate (although, as always, take it with a pinch of salt until it&rsquo;s officially confirmed by Sony), is the processor, which will be a 64-bit Snapdragon 810, clocked to an insanely fast 2.86Ghz. Secondly, the Xperia Z3X is rumoured to have 4GB of RAM, and combined with the processor, that means it will be the most powerful phone on the market.</p>
<p>Potentially more exciting than those specs, however, is the screen, which is said to be a 6.14-inch &ldquo;Trimaster El&rdquo; OLED display (i.e. better than normal OLED screens) with a similar screen resolution to the LG G3 (albeit lower on the short edge, as the screen will be longer and thinner on the Xperia Z3X).</p>
<p>All of that is brilliant, but what really intrigues us is the <i>rumoured</i> accessories for the Xperia Z3X. It appears that Sony is trying to court photography/film-making enthusiasts, as the accessories include an attachable telephoto lens for the 22MP camera, as well as a proper xenon flash, and a high-end microphone for video work!</p>
<p>That might even give the newly-launched Nokia Lumia 930, with its superb camera, a run for its money!</p>
<p><b>There&rsquo;s no confirmation of when the Sony Xperia Z3X might be launched (or even whether it exists at all), but we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this one. Stay tuned for more news! </b></p>
