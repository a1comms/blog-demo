<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Which smartphone will survive? There's only one way to find out.</span></p>
<p>Are the days long gone when phones would shatter the moment you dropped them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the year 2017, and surely, we&rsquo;ve come a long way since then. Today, smartphones are bigger, smarter, and (hopefully) stronger than ever. Dropping your phone shouldn&rsquo;t be such a big deal, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just what the people at YouTube channel TechRax wanted to find out. They decided to get hold of the latest devices, iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8, to see which (if <em>any</em>) would survive being dropped from a height of five feet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15501" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HaGfVgTKbobMDgd9GjMBlEFuoFyqU-0gpbhFmLmkiCpKTdIW7vc2lZ7A9o07zhIVvwaoG_cODq-t7lWWHbumv9LXYQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, to properly test the resilience of these top-of-the-range smartphones, it was important to look at things from every angle&hellip; Or, at the very least, drop them from every angle. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why the presenter decided to drop each device on its side, and then again on its front...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15494" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QVvE76SZkEHS-1U-XvURMrrSei4VmOX6mAphoPLKfvdUsNG8C0F2x6U9Nlx06Mv0EucI5OjdvwH190RWZ9HJZ6t17Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but the thought of destroying more than a thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of smartphones is enough to send shivers down my spine. I mean, iPhone X is worth &pound;999. Add that to today&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy S8 price at &pound;564.99, and we&rsquo;re talking big bucks.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re at all squeamish about destroying seriously valuable tech, look away now. If you just want to see the world burn, check out the video below.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video, both smartphones faired pretty well, though neither of them came out unscarred. Sadly, we don&rsquo;t yet live in a world where smartphones can withstand being dropped on a concrete floor.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take a moment to look at the positives. While both devices sustained tragic injuries in the making of this particular drop test, neither of them broke <em>completely</em>. That&rsquo;s got to be a win.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the takeaway? Well, if you do buy an iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy S8, let this video be a warning to you. Be certain to keep your device secure at all times, and try your hardest not to drop it on a concrete floor. Your bank balance will thank you for that later.</p>

<p>Why not treat yourself to a fresh, unsmashed&nbsp;iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy S8&nbsp;today.</p>
