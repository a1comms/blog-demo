<p>August is almost here and so is the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/samsung-galaxy-note-9-rumours-price-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a>.</p>
<p>While we wait to find out what the device has in store for us, the powers behind the megabrand have taken the chance to offer us a little teaser. It&rsquo;s not much, but since Samsung's been tight-lipped on this phone &ndash; we&rsquo;ll take what we can get.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/samsung-takes-another-dig-at-apple-in-its-latest-advert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung adverts</a> we&rsquo;ve seen of late, there&rsquo;s no mention of the iPhone. Instead, the short, 30-second clip focusses on everyone&rsquo;s worst fear: that is running out of battery power when you <em>really </em>need your phone.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-37lkw_uaQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The video shows someone getting a message on their Samsung about a &lsquo;partners meeting&rsquo; in 15 minutes. The user orders a rideshare quickly, but their battery starts to dwindle. In a flash, they close apps, dim the screen, and start to search for a cable to recharge. They find a charger and a power bank but, alas, they forget to charge it up. The battery sinks to 1%... and then to nothing. It&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>If the above scenario sounds like a nightmare, there&rsquo;s a good reason for that. Losing your phone&rsquo;s power is just about the worst thing that can happen to you when you need it the most. What&rsquo;s more, as smartphones have become more and more essential over the years, the average battery power has struggled to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>Of course, Samsung is not the first phone brand to grab onto the idea that we panic when faced with low battery. Back in 2016, a survey from LG revealed that nine out of ten of us feel &lsquo;panic&rsquo; when our phone battery dips below the 20% mark. *Gasp*</p>
<p>The team dubbed this feeling &lsquo;Low Battery Anxiety&rsquo; and suggested that symptoms might include ordering something at a restaurant just to use their power supply, asking a stranger if you can use their smartphone, secretly borrowing someone&rsquo;s charger, and owning three or more chargers. We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Samsung has included a cheeky little hint that times may be about to change. &ldquo;A lot can change in a day,&rdquo; says the line. &ldquo;August 9th 2018.&rdquo; What does <em>that </em>mean? Well, we only have to wait (less than!) two weeks to find out&hellip; but we&rsquo;re pretty sure that Samsung has something impressive up its sleeve.</p>
