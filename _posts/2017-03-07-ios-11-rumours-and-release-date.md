<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s everything we&rsquo;ve found out about iOS 11, including when you can download it, and all the rumoured new features!</span></p>
<p>You may only have just got used to the changes that iOS 10 made, like all the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/five-fun-new-ways-to-message-in-ios-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new ways to message friends</a>, but the world keeps on spinning, and Apple keeps on updating its operating system.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8KOu4hAgpY?ecver=2" width="600" height="337" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Next in line, for 2017, we anticipate the launch of iOS 11. Already, we can&rsquo;t wait to see what it has in store. No doubt, you feel much the same&hellip; That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve compiled all the most exciting iOS 11 rumours from the Internet for you to enjoy.</p>
<h2>When Can I Download iOS 11?</h2>
<p>Every year, Apple launches its latest version of iOS in tandem with the release of a new iPhone. And that&rsquo;s usually sometime in September.</p>
<p>However, you probably won&rsquo;t have to wait that long to get an iOS 11 preview, because Apple&rsquo;s rather exciting <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/apples-wwdc-2017-event-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2017 event</a> is confirmed for 5-9 June. We expect Apple officials will treat us all to a helping of the latest updates coming to iOS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13244" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IY37hWaw2BTLsZX_1nPdXsucWyyRx1F46UpfufXr_vIwdXK1JXK_NuIehPcQUEn2zeAwGlvF1R7Zse4Vg04Zpy2OcQ=s0" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;re working with Internet rumours, which, if true, could make iOS 11 one of the most exciting updates we&rsquo;ve had in years.</p>
<h2>What to Expect from iOS 11</h2>
<p>When the iOS 11 finally downloads to your iPhone, what can you expect to change? Well, there are lots of things we&rsquo;d <em>love</em> to see, and a few little iOS 11 leaks and rumours have given us an idea of what we might <em>actually</em> see.</p>
<p>From new apps to a better version of Siri (yes!), here&rsquo;s everything we&rsquo;ve heard so far.</p>
<h2>Dark Mode Looks Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>Some of us can worry about how using gadgets might affect our eyesight. That&rsquo;s quite possibly why there&rsquo;s a rumour that Apple will be including a &lsquo;Dark Mode&rsquo; as part of the iOS 11 update.</p>
<p>The idea is that when you switch to this mode, the background of your phone or tablet will switch from light to dark, placing less strain on your eyes when it comes to using your device in dark settings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13409" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m_bdkxSGpNkUwX-1IU2MZC4iWXFf32FXh71QVECKsCXqzo3q8ZAf1TCbpcMN5TcaQmwb9QKZY4Q85ElntwJqk0bv=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re thinking that this is the same as&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/night-shift-on-iphone-might-help-you-sleep-at-night">Night Shift</a> on iPhone, you could not be more wrong. Basically, Night Shift reduces the blue light on your device to apparently aid sleeping, whereas Dark Mode will literally turn the design palette a whole load darker.</p>
<h2>More Life-Like Siri</h2>
<p>Siri is an excellent feature, but we all know that the AI has had some teething problems along the way. One of the most exciting iOS 11 rumours is that the update will bring with it a newer, smarter version of Siri. (Of course, Apple now has to compete with the likes of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/google-assistant-is-about-to-change-android-phones-forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Assistant</a>, so it makes sense that the company would up its game!)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13406" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rkIIqoAB9NgNbBMvSJykhtf32qKi9FUyMAMRyJNiFD0RZi1kE2WFYmndiemWIkxqntbDWnz4iYDpCYsvUvyJsc4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>A couple of the things that we may see with this new update are a more natural (i.e. less robotic) sounding Siri, and a more intuitive platform. So, when you ask Siri a follow-up question, the AI should stay on the original subject rather than you having to clarify what you need again.</p>
<h2>Apple&rsquo;s Own iSnapchat</h2>
<p>Another gem of an iOS 11 leak is that Apple is apparently working on a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/isnapchat-apple-said-to-be-developing-a-video-sharing-app-1327156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video and picture sharing app</a>. The likelihood is that the app will come as standard with the latest update.</p>
<p>While some people have speculated that it may actually be an update to the original camera app, it would make more sense for Apple to release a stand-alone app that works on a social media level too. Could this latest addition to the iOS rival the likes of Snapchat and Instagram? Well, maybe.</p>
<h2>Something VR Related</h2>
<p>Psst&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard, but VR is kind of a big deal in the tech world right now. Already, some Android devices support the Daydream VR system, and so it would only be logical for Apple to bring out something to rival this.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_13412" align="aligncenter" width="2720"]<img class="wp-image-13412 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FW4doPndld7QpZiyyVGJT4ig_bzxIjYkguzL9ljxp72BsuiSqMsYws47fGR9UbE49evAGm67JpCxxMYUvDLw_rKR=s0" width="2720" height="1723" /> Google Daydream[/caption]</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not entirely sure what form an iOS 11 VR platform could come in, but we&rsquo;re certainly willing to wait to find out.</p>
<p><span class="" style="font-size: 23px; color: #444444;">NEXT: More features, and find out if your iPhone is compatible with iOS 11.</span></p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Actual Control Over Your Control Centre</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the best things that the more recent versions of iOS boast is the Control Centre. By simply swiping up from the bottom of your screen, you can access settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the aforementioned Night Shift.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13413" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RqYhN2wJNSEs5tWwqIOd7ufjKH6Cf7HP6d2l2bNhzPd3TMXS7RCwP47wk1nehlpEFMfKxKXZx37BRYzbdA0EDh4b=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s one thing lacking from the current system: the ability to customise the Control Centre. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be ace if you could choose the settings available? Well, according to one of the most popular iOS 11 rumours, that could soon be the case.</p>
<h2>Mail&rsquo;s Bringing Sexy Back</h2>
<p>While the Mail app works well and is compatible with just about any account you may have, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>Over the years, there haven&rsquo;t been all that many changes to the design of the Mail app, probably because, let&rsquo;s face it, email just isn&rsquo;t as sexy as it was back in the 90s. With the latest iOS 11 update, though, Apple is apparently opting for a cleaner and smoother overall design.</p>
<h2>Android-like Widget Options</h2>
<p>As you well know, some of the leading Android devices have supported homescreen widgets for some time now. However, this is an area where Apple hasn&rsquo;t focused much.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13414" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SppDIZ5TsLDL7PNh50RBmHgqBNN2VTLJtVBHlzUCNQMWRUcl3B3m8RgGQgXNYC_YDI3q6_5jG_zKSm_OYnuPX7v2=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Granted, iOS 10 introduced some widget functionality to iPhone, if you swipe left from the homescreen. But we want more!</p>
<p>One of the latest iOS 11 leaks insists that we will finally get more widget flexibility that&rsquo;ll allow users to customise their iPhones like never before.</p>
<h2>Will My iPhone Support iOS 11?</h2>
<p>We have some bad news for iPhone 5 and 5c users. According to the rumours, those two devices (and any older generations, too, of course) won&rsquo;t support iOS 11. If true, that would suggest that they&rsquo;re just too slow and old to run Apple&rsquo;s latest software updates, which might mean it&rsquo;s about time you upgraded&hellip;</p>
