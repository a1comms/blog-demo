<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Bulbasaur, Squirtle or Charmander&hellip; the toughest decision you ever made as a kid. Now you&rsquo;ve got to make it all over again.</span></p>
<p>Pok&eacute;mon GO &ndash; the augmented reality app that lets you catch the famous pocket-friendly creatures in the real world &ndash; now has more downloads than Tinder.</p>
<p>The game itself is simple, using your phone&rsquo;s GPS and camera, immersing players in a real-world adventure where they hunt and capture Pok&eacute;mon in real-time. Once bagged, you can train and fight other Pok&eacute;mon in order to control local gyms.</p>

<p>It truly is an amazing experience to see the nostalgic creatures I grew up loving, finally come to life. And, better yet, it&rsquo;s getting kids who might otherwise be lounging lazily in front of the TV, just like our old friend Snorlax, up and out of the house. Just like the good old days. Sort of.</p>
<p>But the question you&rsquo;re wondering is, how do I get Pok&eacute;mon GO?</p>
<p>The app has been released to several markets around the world for both iOS and Android, but here in the UK, we&rsquo;re still waiting to <em>catch &lsquo;em all</em>&hellip;</p>
<p>Dry your eyes, Weepinbell, we have a solution. Follow our simple steps, and you&rsquo;ll be out hunting for Pikachu in no time.</p>
<p>First thing&rsquo;s first, check whether Pok&eacute;mon GO is available to download from Google Play or the App Store. If you&rsquo;re reading this in the UK, then it probably isn&rsquo;t. So keep reading&hellip;</p>
<h2>How to get Pok&eacute;mon GO on Android</h2>
<p>Android users who don&rsquo;t have the patience to wait for the official release, can download Pok&eacute;mon GO from&nbsp;APK Mirror. Take caution though, rumours are floating around claiming that developer Niantic may ban users who do so.</p>
<h2>How to get Pok&eacute;mon GO on iOS</h2>
<p>Apple users simply need to change the country that their Apple Store account is linked to, to one where Pok&eacute;mon GO has already launched. To do so, go to Settings > iTunes &amp; App Store > Apple ID.</p>
<p><strong>So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start playing out your childhood dream of catching all 150 Pok&eacute;mon, and kicking some gym leaders&rsquo; asses along the way.</strong></p>
