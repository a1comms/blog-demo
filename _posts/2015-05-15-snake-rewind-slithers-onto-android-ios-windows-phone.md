<p><span class="postStandFirst">Snake, the definitive yardstick used to measure thumb reflexes and sharp acumen, is making a nostalgic return to mobiles.</span></p>
<p>Taneli Armanto, the original creator of Snake, has teamed up with <a href="http://www.rumilusdesign.com/index.php?page=games&amp;game=snakerewind" target="_blank">Rumilus Design</a> to resuscitate the once ubiquitous mobile game, by launching Snake Rewind for free across <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rumilusdesign.snake" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snake-rewind/id915939754" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/snake-rewind/d4260d60-46b8-4a48-8eb0-2e5d9375526a" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>.</p>
<p>In days of yore, Snake was <em>the </em>source of entertainment on our unwieldy Nokia mobile phones. The rudimentary graphics were oddly enchanting, seducing us into hours of fixated gameplay.</p>
<p>The plot was a simple one: commandeer a snake and begin carving a serpentine path around a cramped screen, with the objective of swallowing as many pixels as possible, before the inevitable collision with the perilous confines of your cage, or your own elongating tail.</p>
<p>Snake Rewind hangs on to much of the original charm and goals, though with modernised, souped-up graphics that bring it into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and some never-before-seen features like obstacles, power ups and the ability to rewind after a fatal move (in exchange for hard-earned pieces of fruit).</p>
<p>Snake Rewind will no doubt constrict users into long periods of game play, now with 10 distinct levels to slither through. Not to mention the teaser in the app description, &ldquo;Fill the whole screen with the snake and find out what happens then!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Download Snake Rewind from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rumilusdesign.snake" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snake-rewind/id915939754" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/snake-rewind/d4260d60-46b8-4a48-8eb0-2e5d9375526a" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>.</strong></p>
