<p>The wait is over. You need no longer twiddle your thumbs wondering when you&rsquo;ll get a chance to upgrade to the much-awaited iOS 11.</p>
<p>Today is the day! Yep, Tuesday 19 September marks the official launch of iOS 11, Apple&rsquo;s latest operating system. It really is time to celebrate with this new upgrade.</p>
<p>Before we get into how to download iOS 11 for free on your iPhone or iPad, here are 11 new features you should be very excited about.</p>
<h2>1) A Sexy New&nbsp;App Store</h2>
<p>During the WWDC 2017 keynote earlier this year, Apple announced a load of new iOS 11 features. In all the excitement, though, the brand-new App Store might have escaped you. Yes, with the latest update, Apple will be revamping the store so that it&rsquo;s easier than ever to discover the things that you love.</p>

<h2>2)&nbsp;Easy-to-access Notifications</h2>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14007" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tKP1L5bLOgEiqPGg59shCYn2rPJ47rlBYZijYrVg6taUDgiNZTIab2NHRBxC6jJbUomBQX_rJ8EBOojicJtZycg=s0" alt="" /></h2>
<p>Right now, on iOS 10, your lockscreen and notification centre are two separate entities. If you want to see what you&rsquo;ve missed, you need to swipe down from the top of the screen. It&rsquo;s easy enough, but could it be easier? Well, Apple seems to think so.</p>
<p>With iOS 11, things are set to change. Rather than having two separate screens for these functions, they&rsquo;ll live on the same screen. Essentially, that means that you&rsquo;ll be able to see all your notifications <em>without </em>having to swipe or unlock your phone.</p>
<h2>3) Even Livelier Live Photos</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14008" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gqdnMX6opkqyTK3xR07GNM_Hqf3cfOXZcmf10ncSlu1HbVkaR6YjcwcYvJL2ETZhZ8dGxmsLljPXQ8YBIfPCGbQKIg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole load of new iOS 11 features that&rsquo;ll help you take your photo game to the next level. For one thing, Apple&rsquo;s Live Photos will help you share intriguing snaps in modes such as Bounce and Loop, making them even, well, livelier.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s set to be a whole load of new filters for your pictures, too, so each and every one will be Instagram-ready before you even open the app.</p>
<p>Oh, and as if they weren't&nbsp;enough, there&rsquo;s a brand-new system of storing photos and videos too. While this system may not change the way you search for your media, it will take up much less space on your iPhone.</p>

<h2>4) A Whole New (Virtual) World</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14010" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Aixr10vS69_Swd5vfmDOokgj5rDxzRLqT3LYVkbDqP48Ldw43zxAS1p1L-DJaA-iAr6rkzgXRyYg8X_LSBtVSvfzcw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>It may only be developers who&rsquo;re raving about Apple&rsquo;s new ARKit right now, but think of all the possibilities that this opens up. Now, those very developers will be able to create impressive augmented reality images for both your iPad and iPhone. These ought to sync with the camera which means that you&rsquo;ll soon have access to a whole new, virtual world.</p>
<h2>5) Siri Just Got Even Brainier!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14009" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U2lkgS91LHeW7JpoOUTXncCmu8sBYRjgpIG8UCMcwJlebbmUz8ICxiSzMiRJGvhboKE5on0JDpOyr8vUopMwU1ps=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While Siri has come a long, long way over the years, the AI isn&rsquo;t yet the perfect assistant we dream of. iOS 11 aims to change that, getting us a bit closer to the goal.</p>
<p>Siri on iOS 11 will have enhanced &lsquo;contextual learning&rsquo;, which should mean that it&rsquo;s smarter than ever before. When you listen to a certain news story from the app, you should find that Siri <em>remembers </em>and is able to answer follow-up questions relating to what you've just found out.</p>
<p>Many Apple fans will also be happy to hear that Siri is getting a brand new, more authentic voice. Choose either a male or female in a variety of accents, for a less robotic and more human experience.</p>
<p>Plus, perhaps even cooler, Siri will be able to translate different languages for you. Speaking English, you can ask it how to say to say phrases in Chinese, Spanish, French, German or Italian.</p>
<h2>6) Do Not Disturb While Driving</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14011" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cz6NMrKkwSO5NBXSAZkdkoD8o9C0z7kIicY1f0sypEL02JS0p2PY3kL_iEiKrST2IpiaxDPR20N_LHeQ7NidmA4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Road safety is an important issue that all too often goes overlooked. Luckily, Apple has got this one covered. One of the most useful iOS 11 features is the &lsquo;Do Not Disturb While Driving&rsquo; mode.</p>
<p>Your iPhone will immediately switch into this mode when you start driving, which means that you needn&rsquo;t worry about it at all.</p>
<p>Once in Do Not Disturb While Driving, you won&rsquo;t get any notifications. That means you won&rsquo;t get stressed out when your phone starts beeping and you&rsquo;re behind the wheel. It also forces you to quit texting and driving (which is a dangerous and illegal habit!).</p>

<h2>7) Never Get Lost in Huge Shopping Centres (Again)</h2>
<p>Apple Maps is growing beyond your typical A-to-B directions app, and will feature detailed maps of worldwide airports and shopping centres. You'll be able to find the Starbucks nearest to your flight gate in no time. And, thankfully, you won't have to relive the embarrassing experience of getting lost in a huge, anonymous shopping centre.</p>

<h2>8) Tighter Organisation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14013" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SWKQ1ox8w16TzHVc0hVa37GpcpTsfO2XVsJO4y3nSLFKI7s713nbICS1H2NRcISuJBVqCpCmEz3vTdRWv6qVQwjE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a whole load of hype about the brand-new Files app, but we still don&rsquo;t know all that much about it just yet. The idea is that the app will allow you to sort through your iPad and iCloud files quickly and easily. Whether this will be a better system than the one we already have on our devices, only time will tell.</p>
<h2>9) The Dock is Coming to iPad!</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14014" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZIOiFBvc78bSRmjx0-jbj5r0PvkuQH3pL4f-JlXFIstXIUBlTBpXPNYBDZU8FKmBPr9d8IRW7_VzwXMUmQuLn4UO=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you own an iPad Pro 10.5 or an iPad Pro 12.9, iOS 11 will bring something new your way. With the upgrade, your iPad will finally get a dock at the bottom of the screen (much like Macs currently have!). The idea is that this bridges the gap between tablets and laptops; people should be able to use their iPads as replacements for computers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll also be able to drag and drop things on the screen, which will open a new world of possibilities. It seems that Apple is trying to give people much more control over how they use their iPads, which can only be a good thing, right?</p>
<h2>10) More Control Over the Control Centre</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14015" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/azq8eTQBs_oKnyfIrQkKoWiBpaKjnj0PnCat6o15R3wjPXP9aWg7nGBKX7hukggvLhIvQ7-N1_ijf-C4ydsmJbbdUg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>On iOS 11 you&rsquo;ll be able to make the Control Centre yours, by choosing and changing the settings, and putting the controls that are important to you front and center. Introduce settings like Voice Memos, and even Home controls for your connected lights and whatever else.</p>
<h2>11) One-Handed Typing (Like a Boss)</h2>
<p>If you've ever held your iPhone in one hand, and tried composing a message, you've no doubt experienced the struggle of reaching your thumb all the way across the keyboard. On iOS 11, you can hold the emoji or glob key, select one-handed typing, and the keys will shift closer to your thumb.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14978" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/asF-mN1QZWk-6odKb05oa_yxYEKH4eopuUbnxt4bjWxE8yHeeBOe8OIqj3AvypA0eCOt--Ge2jQqi8RkRHFWs18NGQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>How Do I Download iOS 11?</h2>
<p>So, the question you&rsquo;ve been waiting for:&nbsp;how can I download iOS 11 for free, right now?</p>
<p>Well, before you do anything, make sure that your battery is fully charged (or your iPhone is on charge) and you have free storage space (total amount needed to be confirmed).</p>
<p>Apple advises you backup all your files, photos and music etc. to iCloud. Once you&rsquo;ve checked these off the list, downloading iOS 11 is a piece of cake. Go to: <strong>Settings > General > Software Update</strong></p>
<p>When the iOS 11 upgrade is available for your iPhone <strong>-</strong> <strong>this can vary from iPhone to iPhone, as well as your region, so keep checking back</strong> <strong>-</strong> you&rsquo;ll see an option to download and update. Depending on your internet speed, this may take some time.</p>
