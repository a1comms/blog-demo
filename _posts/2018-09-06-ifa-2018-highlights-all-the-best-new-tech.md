<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what you missed at Berlin&rsquo;s massive trade show.</span></p>
<p>One of the most exciting events in the tech-lovers&rsquo; calendars ended yesterday. Yes, the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin (IFA) 2018 drew to a close and all that remains is the new tech it brought the world. From some exciting new smartphones to watches and speakers, here are some of the highlights that you might have missed.</p>
<h2>Sony Xperia XZ3</h2>
<p>You could be forgiven for overlooking the phones that <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony</a> has to offer. In a world dominated by <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a>, and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei</a> devices, there seems little room for another leading brand. However, the company&rsquo;s latest flagship phone, which was revealed at the IFA 2018, is one that you shouldn&rsquo;t ignore.</p>
<p>With a 6-inch screen, a killer camera, wireless charging, and waterproofing too, it&rsquo;s quite clear to everybody that Sony has pulled out the big guns here. The device is powered by Snapdragon 845 and has an <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/android-9-pie-is-official-here-are-7-key-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android 9 Pie</a> operating system.</p>
<p>As though that weren&rsquo;t enough to tickle your fancy, it&rsquo;s also a thing of true beauty. Coming in black, white silver, forest green and Bordeaux red and sporting an almost bezeless (all-screen) look, it&rsquo;s a phone that looks and feels like a leader. The phone will go on sale in October 2018 at around the &pound;690 mark. Watch this space.</p>

<h2>Huawei Mate 20 Lite</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the event was the Huawei Mate 20 Lite announcement. With the flagship Huawei Mate 20 yet to be launched, it seems an odd move from the Chinese mega-brand. However, the device sounds pretty darn impressive. Packing 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage, the phone is a real competitor.</p>
<p>The specs sound rather impressive too. There&rsquo;s a Kirin 710 processor, a dual rear camera, a 24-megapixel front camera, and expandable storage too. It begs the question, if this is the Lite, what will the full version of the phone have to offer? And, that&rsquo;s the point. The phone should cost around &pound;379 and will be available in October 2018.</p>

<h2>HTC U12 Life</h2>
<p>Looking for an attractive mid-range phone that ticks all the boxes? The HTC U12 Life could be it. The device was unveiled as part of the IFA 2018 and looks set to be a real crowd-pleaser. With a 6-inch display, a headphone jack, dual rear cameras, and a pretty looking design, it&rsquo;s an all around winner.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not all-singing and dancing like some flagship models, but then, it&rsquo;s not supposed to be. The slimmed down phone will only be available here in Europe (sorry, USA and Australia!) and will cost a meagre &pound;299. It&rsquo;s a budget-friendly option!</p>

<h2>Honor Play</h2>
<p>The name says it all. Rather than trying to compete head-on with flagship phones, the Huawei sub-brand is putting all its eggs in a playful basket. The Honor Play is a phone that will focus on gaming and entertainment. Boasting the Kirin 970 processor, Android Oreo, 4GB of RAM, and a 6.3-inch almost all-screen design, it&rsquo;s a decent enough offering.</p>
<p>The idea is that the phone allows people to play immersive games without disruption. Whether the device will deliver on that promise is yet to be seen. One thing&rsquo;s for sure, though. It looks fantastic. Available in black or blue, the phone costs just &pound;279.99. Bargain.</p>

<h2>Bang &amp; Olufsen Beosound Edge</h2>
<p>When is a speaker not a speaker? The answer is simple &ndash;&nbsp;when it&rsquo;s the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beosound Edge.</p>
<p>The ridiculously chic looking smart speaker is one that you can&rsquo;t take your eyes off. It looks like a piece of art, which is the exact point. Everything about this speaker simply screams &ldquo;Look! I&rsquo;m new and different!&rdquo; For example, to control the device, you don&rsquo;t use buttons but have to rock the speaker back and forward.</p>
<p>Luckily, the gadget is compatible with a whole load of systems out there. You can use it with Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2 and Chromecast. Of course, this type of tech is not a competitor for the general market; it&rsquo;s super high-end. If you want this beautiful thing to bring music to your home, it will set you back &pound;2900 and comes out in November 2018.</p>

<h2>Google Home Max</h2>
<p>The news that the Google Home Max will be available in the UK came out at the show too. The device is a super loud smart speaker with 4.5-inch high-excursion woofers which should help you to fill the entire room. Of course, like Google Home devices before it, this one uses AI to work. That&rsquo;s a given.</p>
<p>However, it has an extra level of intrigue to it. The AI works with a system called Smart Sound which adapts the noise depending on where you place the speaker. The device will cost around &pound;399 and is available in UK stores now.</p>

<h2>Casio Pro Trek Watches</h2>
<p>The third generation of Casio Pro Trek watches were revealed as part of the IFA 2018. One of the most notable things about this latest device is its offline capabilities. The WSD-F30 boasts some cool features, such as using colour maps while you&rsquo;re offline. It also has a three-day GPS log recording system which is nifty too.</p>
<p>Of course, the market for this device is pretty niche. If you&rsquo;re an outdoor lover who also has a penchant for tech, though, you&rsquo;re likely to fall head over heels with it. Plus, the battery life has been extended which is sure to please most people too. The release date and price are yet to be announced.</p>
