<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s that time of year again! It&rsquo;s time for another flagship to join the hallowed ranks of Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy S series of phones!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4752 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" width="768" height="782" /></p>
<p>After a year of success, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is about to step down from its ultra-high-end pedestal, and the Samsung Galaxy S5 is about to take its place at the top of the Korean manufacturer&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>
<p>As stated during the official unveiling, Samsung has decided to take a &lsquo;back to basics&rsquo; approach to the development of the Samsung Galaxy S5, although that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should expect less from this new flagship. In fact, the new range of features that Samsung has added take the range to new heights!</p>
<p>While there are incremental updates to the technology, including a new 16 megapixel camera and a purportedly better battery life, it&rsquo;s the new features which are undoubtedly going to grab the most headlines. Things like the ability to combine its 4G signal and WiFi (for a&nbsp;<em>truly</em>&nbsp;super-fast data speed), added biometric security in the form of a fingerprint scanner (which can also be used to authorise PayPal payments), and a heart monitor/pedometer for fitness buffs, are going to be what really captures the public&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, there&rsquo;s the fact that, like the Sony Xperia Z1, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is waterproof. That&rsquo;s a feature we hope to see on&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;phone, eventually (especially on 2014&rsquo;s inevitable successor to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3)!</p>
<p>Alongside the Samsung Galaxy S5, the Korean manufacturer also unveiled its next generation of smartwatches, the Samsung Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo. Unlike the previous model, these new smartwatches will run on Tizen OS, and both are designed to work as companion device to the Galaxy S5.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll have more information on pricing and availability soon, so keep watching this space.</strong></p>
