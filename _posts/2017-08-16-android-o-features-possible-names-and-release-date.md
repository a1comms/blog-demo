<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Could Android O&nbsp;be Android <em>Oreo</em>? Or Android... Octopus?</span></p>
<p>Excited about the next release of Android? You certainly will be after we run through its upcoming features. Plus, we try to work out what the &lsquo;o&rsquo; in Android O is going to be. And we&rsquo;ll also let you in on when this update is being released.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about some interesting new features, and how they&rsquo;ll change the way you use your Android smartphone.</p>
<h2>1) The Ability to Juggle Apps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture in Picture mode allows one app window to lay on top of the other. For example, you may have a small YouTube window open in the corner, while using another app. It means that you can juggle apps and multitask without using the old split-screen function. Neat. </span></p>
<h2>2) New Android TV Launcher</h2>
<p>Finding new content will be easier than ever with Android O, or Android 8.0 as it's also known. The reason is simple: it&rsquo;ll bring with it a new Android TV design. The idea is that you&rsquo;ll be able to discover more videos that you enjoy, while the experience is more user-friendly.</p>

<h2>3) Snooze Notifications for Later</h2>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re busy doing something, but you&rsquo;ve got notifications pouring in because you&rsquo;re just that in-demand, and you wish you could put them on ice and revisit them later. Well, Google&rsquo;s developing a notification snooze for just that reason.</p>
<h2>4) Emojis That Always Work&nbsp;&#x1f64c;&#x1f3fb;</h2>
<p>Emojis are part of how we communicate in the technological world. Hence, it&rsquo;s infuriating when that aubergine icon your friend sent you doesn&rsquo;t load, because you&rsquo;re keyboard isn&rsquo;t as up to date. Luckily, as part of Android O&rsquo;s new features, these &lsquo;broken&rsquo; emojis will be fixed. Phew!</p>

<h2>5) No More Leaked Pics</h2>
<p>One of the biggest worries for people these days is their private information being leaked somehow. What with the cloud and open sharing, and recent celebrity scandals, you might stress about what media is out there for the world to see.</p>
<p>Smarter Sharing will mean that your phone suggests what apps are right for the images, links, and videos you have. So, for example, a receipt may be right for a finance tracking app, whereas a selfie is ideal for Instagram. Depending on the selfie, of course.</p>
<h2>6) Super Stylish Icons</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it, Android&rsquo;s home icons are pretty darn stylish. With the latest Android 8.0&nbsp;update, developers will now be able to mimic this style with ease. Yes, you will be seeing a whole load more round app icons very, very soon.</p>

<p><span class="" style="font-size: 23px; color: #444444;">NEXT: More amazing features, plus the name behind 'O', and the release date.</span></p>

<h2>7) Animations That Make You Say 'Wow'</h2>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s where things might sound a little technical. One of the most exciting Android O features is something called "physics-based animation." What that means is the new animations on your Android phone will look more realistic, in the way that it moves on your screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13890" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y3xCNx7JhQSjMB_U6cu6tWHmQ_XhhvOTRlGSFJzrpktSMr0uKZ-EqKbucSxBQVpRUop_svX6BlQJNRhFHjOO9vSl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>8) Shut Down Annoying Notifications</h2>
<p>If you want to cut down on the amount of notifications you see (who doesn&rsquo;t?), this little Android O feature will be right up your street. The Notification Channels function will let you dictate which apps send you notifications and which don&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2>9) Take a Sneak Peak at Notifications</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the new inclusion of Badge Notifications, small dots that sit over the apps themselves. You can now long-press the apps to see what the notifications are rather than going into the app. Handy, no?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13884" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d0PiT8hV87EmZxOzLhjhwUy8ESfgEtGJ12jJgmbEzp6MeLfVzzMzhIEbc03Oxt4_Rni9sVjWQLPgxEW0V9dSwjTtAA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>10) More Colourful Notifications</h2>
<p>Finally, Android will make it possible to assign different colours to notifications. That could mean that one colour could signify a different level of priority. Right now, it&rsquo;s unclear just how much people will use this feature, but who knows?</p>
<h2>11) Super-Useful Notification Dots</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before now, not all apps had notification dots. That meant that you actually had to press the app and open it to see whether you had anything new. Luckily, Android O is set to change that. Much like iOS, you'll get bubble dots on apps when you have notifications.</span></p>
<h2>12) Restricted Background Activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your phone is always running out of juice, here&rsquo;s a feature that you'll adore. Android O will have restricted background activities, which means that there won&rsquo;t be a bunch of pesky apps draining your battery when you&rsquo;re not even using them. </span></p>

<h2>What Will Android O Be Called?</h2>
<p>Now that you know what features to expect from the Android O, let&rsquo;s talk about what really matters: the name. While we don&rsquo;t have any official word on what the update will be called, we can take a pretty good guess at it.</p>
<p>You see, there&rsquo;s a pattern here. First there was Android Alpha and Android Beta, but after that, the developers (still running with the alphabetical order) started naming Android updates after sweets and deserts. We&rsquo;ve had Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and, most recently, Nougat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13886" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9RkoYiTCXFUjn-41lu974tMyb82IQtJeEYDjxHBBJschDu7H20dS5B3VFbCirgyPslkDduN5f-XgxTosNQPG__Xqjw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, what will the next Android update be called? Well, following the above logic, the update will go by the name <em>Android</em>, followed by something sweet&nbsp;beginning with &lsquo;o&rsquo;. For example, they may choose Android Oreo (as a cheeky brand placement), Android Oatmeal, or Android Orange. Who knows? At this point, we can only guess.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to complicate matters more, Android may actually ditch the whole dessert naming convention altogether, however unlikely. Developers say that the beta version of Android O contains an &lsquo;octopus&rsquo; easter egg. That could mean that the new name will in fact be called&nbsp;</span><b>Android Octopus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No, we don't believe it either, but those are the latest rumours!</span></p>

<h2>When Will Android O Be Available?</h2>
<p>The Android 8.0&nbsp;release date is still yet to be confirmed. However, we do know that it will be around August or September this year, following Google&rsquo;s usual pattern. You may remember that Android Nougat came out last year in August.</p>
<p>Can't wait? Well you might be able to download the Android O Beta version today.</p>
