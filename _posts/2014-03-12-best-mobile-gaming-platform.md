<p><span class="postStandFirst">Mobile gaming is big business, nowadays, with all three of the major smartphone platforms, and mobile games are consistently amongst the most downloaded and used apps on smartphones. But which smartphone platform is the best for mobile games?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5831 aligncenter" alt="OS Gaming" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/OS-Gaming-1024x567.png" width="960" height="531" /></p>
<p>Answering that question isn&rsquo;t as simple as lining up phones and seeing which offers the best graphics, however, as so often happens with consoles and PC games. Mobile gaming is different to either of those, and so we need to judge the three smartphone platforms,&nbsp;Android,&nbsp;iOS&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows Phone, on different criteria.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s begin with:</p>
<h2>Platform-Exclusive Games</h2>
<p>Platform-exclusives (such as&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;on PlayStation, or&nbsp;<em>HALO</em>&nbsp;on Xbox) are often said to be the bane of the console gaming world. In spite of that, you&rsquo;ll often find that it&rsquo;s a similar situation in the world of mobile gaming, with games like&nbsp;<em>HALO: Spartan Assault</em>&nbsp;(exclusive to Windows phones like the Nokia Lumia 1020) or the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Blade</em>&nbsp;series (exclusive to iOS devices such as the iPhone 5s). As those two platforms, iOS and Windows Phone, have more &ldquo;<em>big name</em>&rdquo; exclusives than Android, this category has to be a draw between the two of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/9817319564_9469221c2e_n.jpg" width="320" height="283" /></p>
<h2>Online Gaming Communities</h2>
<p>On paper, Windows Phone should have the advantage here, as it has had Xbox Live built into the core OS since its very inception. In practice, though, all three of the major platforms have their own similar community services, with Google Play Games on Android, and Games Center on iOS. As such, this category ends up in a draw between all&nbsp;<em>three</em>&nbsp;operating systems.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Accessories</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s in this category that Android begins to really shine as a gaming platform, as it offers full USB support, allowing you to plug in things like Xbox controllers to your tablet or smartphone. Of course, iOS allows users to use third party controllers as well, but Android has another ace up its sleeve; some companies have even started making Android-powered&nbsp;<em>consoles</em>. That may stretch the definition of &ldquo;third-party accessories&rdquo;, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;an important factor in giving Android credibility as a gaming platform.</p>
<h2>Emulation, OnLive and Other Services</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to an area where Android utterly&nbsp;<em>trounces</em>&nbsp;the opposition. Firstly, Android phones (like the upcoming Sony Xperia Z2) and tablets are the only place where you can find emulators to run, for example, old Nintendo, Sega, Commodore 64 or Spectrum games.</p>
<p>Secondly, Android is the only smartphone platform where you can download and use the OnLive game streaming service, and incredibly cool app, which will allow you to play&nbsp;<em>high-end</em>&nbsp;PC games on your phone (as they are rendered on OnLive&rsquo;s servers, and the video and sound&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;are pumped to your phone)!</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation Network, which is exclusive not just to Android phones, but to Android phones that have been certified by Sony themselves. As exclusive apps go, it doesn&rsquo;t get much more exclusive than this!</p>
<p><strong>And so, while all three smartphone platforms make for great gaming systems, there&rsquo;s only one that&rsquo;s versatile enough to do it perfectly. Thus, the answer to the question in the title of this article is a simple one: when it comes to smartphones, the best gaming platform is Android.</strong></p>
