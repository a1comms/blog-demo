<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The next flagship could be the slickest yet!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering what the people at Sony have up their sleeves this time, we might have the inside scoop for you.</p>
<p>This year is sure to see the release of the brand new Xperia phone, which is most likely to be called the XZ4.</p>
<p>Currently, the company has not released any official information about the upcoming device. However, there have been a few rumours knocking about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the most intriguing titbits.</p>
<h2>Design: Minimal, Angular, And Sleek</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_19847" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-19847 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/sony-xpera-xz4-leak-back.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" /> Images source: www.mysmartprice.com[/caption]</p>
<p>One of the biggest Sony Xperia XZ4 leaks so far comes in the form of a design mock-up.</p>
<p>The image was first published on <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/sony-xperia-xz4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Smart Price</a> and shows a large, almost bezeless design with sharp corner angles.</p>
<p>The same leak suggested that the device may have a slim bezel around the edge of the device along with a curved side. Interesting.</p>
<h2>Camera: Triple-lens Setup</h2>
<p>With many of the latest flagships opting for a triple-lens setup, it appears that Sony may not want to be left behind.</p>
<p>The same leaked design shows not one or two, but three lenses on the rear of the slick device. The lenses sit comfortably in a vertical line, rather than in a grid format.</p>
<p>If this sneakily leaked image turns out to be right, we could see some great photography from the next line of Sony smartphones.</p>
<h2>Screen: Larger and Thinner</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Exclusive: I received the tempered film of the Sony Xperia XZ4.This phone is too long. After measuring, the length of the XZ4 screen is 15.2cm, which is similar to the length of the iPhone Xs Max. <a href="https://t.co/cc39F7tKKs">pic.twitter.com/cc39F7tKKs</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Phone displays are kind of a huge deal at the moment and Sony could be making moves toward a larger screen than ever before.</p>
<p>The original leaked design mock-up suggests that the phone will have 6.5-inch screen along with a super-wide 21:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, according to one leaked photo on Twitter, the length of the phone will be 15.2cm. That could mean that the screen is altogether larger and, indeed, thinner than previous smartphone screens, which may prove to be a hit if it comes to fruition.</p>
<h2>Power: The Latest Chipset</h2>
<p>When it comes to its flagship devices, Sony rarely scrimps on power. The chances are that, when the phone is finally released, it will have the latest Snapdragon 855 chipset.</p>
<p>Since the phone should be launched in the coming months, it&rsquo;s quite likely that it will have the Android 9 Pie, as that is also the newest incarnation of the software.</p>
<h2>Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>So, when will the phone hit stores? The Sony Xperia XZ4 release date has yet to be set.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a decent enough chance that the phone will be announced as part of the Mobile World Congress, which takes place between 25th and 28th February 2019.</p>
<p>After all, last year, Sony unveiled the Xperia XZ2 model as part of the same event.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no official word on how much the phone will set you back either. With that in mind, we can only look at previous moves by Sony and make a somewhat educated guess.</p>
<p>The Xperia XZ2 originally retailed at the mid-range price of &pound;699. It wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprising if the Sony Xperia XZ4 had a similar price point when it launched.</p>
<p>But who really knows what the future holds? For now, we will simply have to wait and see what happens.</p>
