<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">Oppo may not be a well-known manufacturer in the UK, but the company&rsquo;s latest phone may well change that. It&rsquo;s called the Oppo R5, and at a shockingly tiny 4.8mm thick, it is the slimmest smartphone to ever hit the market! But how does it stack up against big name rivals from Samsung and Apple?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5984" alt="oppo r5" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/1029201441855PM_635_oppo_r5.jpg" width="635" height="476" /></p>
<p>Oppo may not be a household name in the UK, but that just means that the company has to work a little bit harder when it wants to grab headlines, and get its brand out there into the public consciousness.</p>
<p>Their latest attempt to do that involves two new smartphones that have rather <i>distinctive</i> traits, according to TechRadar; one of them, the Oppo R5, is in fact the slimmest smartphone <i>ever</i> made.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll save that one for a moment, and first have a look at the Oppo N3, which comes with a <i>motorised</i> camera. That&rsquo;s a neat little feature, and the extra utility it will provide when taking selfies or panorama photos (as the camera can rotate up to 206 degrees) could be a real boon to avid amateur photographers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5985" alt="6" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/6-1024x580.jpg" width="576" height="326" /></p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s the Oppo R5 that seems destined to grab the lion&rsquo;s share of the headlines, as it is the thinnest phone to enter into the smartphone world. Coming in at a shockingly slim <i>4.85mm</i>, the Oppo R5 is almost unbelievable; that 4.85mm depth is barely enough to fit a microSD slot inside the phone! It certainly outdoes every other smartphone on the market, from the Samsung Galaxy S5 (which comes in at 8.1mm thick) to the Sony Xperia Z3 (7.3mm), managing to be a clear 2mm thinner than the 6.9mm thick iPhone 6!</p>
<p>The fact it manages to be <i>that </i>thin, while still coming with a 2.1GHz Snapdragon 615 processor (Qualcomm&rsquo;s new 64-bit octa-core chip), 2GB of RAM, a 5.2-inch 1080p screen, <i>and</i> a 13MP camera... well, that just boggles the mind!</p>
<p><b>There&rsquo;s no confirmed UK launch date for the Oppo R5, but we shall be watching this one with great interest, if only because we can&rsquo;t wait to get hold of one and figure out just how in the name of sanity Oppo managed to pack so much into so slim a frame...</b></p>
