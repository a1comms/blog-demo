<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is due to be officially launched soon, as Samsung continues the tradition of big-screen phablets that the company began with the original Galaxy Note. We take a look at the rumours, to see whether this new super-sized superphone will be jaw-dropping enough to to carry on the legacy laid down by the Galaxy Note 3.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4795" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/Galxy-Note3_026_front-dynamic-with-pen3_Jet-Black-937x1024.jpg" width="562" height="614" /></p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was <i>the</i> superlative phablet, with tons of power, a gorgeous slim body, and a massive screen that let it also be used as one would use a tablet (there are even tales of people switching over from using PCs to <i>just</i> using the Galaxy Note 3).</p>
<p>It was, in short, brilliant, but as always, time marches on, and we&rsquo;re getting closer to the launch of <i>this</i> year&rsquo;s successor to the Galaxy Note 3, a phone that&rsquo;s roughly <i>99.999%</i> certain to be called the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>As always happens in these situations, there have already been a slew of rumours online about what the Galaxy Note 4 will be like, what features it will have, and what new stuff Samsung plans on including to wow us, all over again.</p>
<p>And crucially, how will it compare to last year&rsquo;s Galaxy Note 3? Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4794" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/Galaxy-Note-3-Merlot-Red-2-1024x681.jpg" width="576" height="383" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was a beautiful phone, as we hinted at earlier, but when you consider that <i>every</i> Samsung phone is easy on the eyes, that&rsquo;s not hugely surprising.</p>
<p>And so, we expect the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to follow in its predecessors footsteps, with a slim, gorgeous body. However, there&rsquo;s rumoured to be a <i>big</i> addition in this new incarnation, as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is rumoured to be water-resistant, just like the Samsung Galaxy S5. That was the one feature we really wish had been included in the Galaxy Note 4, so we hope this rumour does indeed come to pass.</p>
<h2>Features &amp; Hardware</h2>
<p>Make no mistake, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was, and still <i>is</i>, a wonderfully powerful phone, and quite frankly, it&rsquo;s hard to top. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note, if the rumours are accurate, will take this power to the next level, using either a Snapdragon 805 or a next-generation Samsung Exynos processor.</p>
<p>As for other hardware, the most notable rumour is over the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner, something inherited from the Galaxy S5 rather than from the Galaxy Note 3.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4793" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/1Galaxy-Note3-FlipCover_004_Open-Pen_Jet-Black-1-1010x1024.jpg" width="576" height="584" /></p>
<p>There have been a few rumours saying that the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will have a 12MP camera, but if we&rsquo;re honest, we&rsquo;re not sure we believe them, and the reason why is simple: the Galaxy Note 3 has a 13MP camera, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine Samsung going backwards.</p>
<p>Of course, other rumours state that the Galaxy Note 4 will have a 16MP camera (again like the Galaxy S5), but with optical image stabilisation included, and those rumours sound a lot more plausible.</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to the main thing that sets phablets apart from other top-end smartphones, as they have huge screens. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is said to have a 5.7-inch and while that may not sound too exciting (because that&rsquo;s the same size as the Galaxy Note 3), it&rsquo;s also said to be a Quad-HD screen, just like the LG G3.</p>
<p>So, basically, if that does prove to be true, the Galaxy Note 4 may well be nearly twice the resolution of its predecessor, and thus, we really hope that does actually happen! It may also have a wraparound screen, one that wraps around the edges of the phone, and that rumour is less plausible, that could be really intriguing indeed.</p>
<p><strong>As of right now, all of this is just conjecture, and will remain so until the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is officially launched. Nonetheless, if even half these rumours prove to be true, then this ultra-powerful phablet will be a truly worthy successor to the Galaxy Note 3. The Galaxy Note 4 is due to be launched in September, so watch this space for more news!</strong></p>
