<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is the Chinese megabrand ahead of the game?</span></p>
<p>Are you ready to say hello to foldable phones? We&rsquo;ve already sniffed out rumours about the powers at Samsung putting its efforts into developing this futuristic tech. But wait, what if another brand &ndash; say, the third largest &ndash;&nbsp;beats it to the punch?</p>
<p>Yes, the people behind Huawei Technologies could be planning to release the world&rsquo;s first foldable phone, according to a new <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Huawei-aims-to-launch-world-s-first-foldable-screen-phone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by Nikkei, Asian Review.</p>
<p>The report suggests that the manufacturer has teamed up with BOE Technology Group to get panels sporting a &lsquo;flexible organic lighting-emitting diode display.&rsquo; In short, the screen will be bendable!</p>

<p>Before now, we&rsquo;ve heard reports that <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-might-have-three-screens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung is planning to release a foldable phone</a> in the first half of 2019. The date is significant as it will mark the 10th year anniversary of the Galaxy line of phones &ndash; the company&rsquo;s most successful flagship range. Rumours have been rife about how the device may look.</p>
<p>The brand-new phone will have a 7.3-inch seamless display and be no thicker than the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone 8</a> or <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, experts told Nikkei. The device may be able to withstand folding thousands of times before it has an impact on the phone. While it&rsquo;s all pretty mysterious right now, we&rsquo;re excited. The same report suggests that Samsung will release 200 million units next year.</p>

<h2>Huawei to Steal Samsung&rsquo;s Thunder</h2>
<p>However, Huawei engineers could be working extremely hard to steal Samsung&rsquo;s thunder and release its phone first. If the rumours are true, the manufacturing processes are well underway, which means that we might see a foldable phone sooner rather than later. The initial batch may be a small one &ndash; that&rsquo;s not really the point. It&rsquo;s about timing.</p>
<p>Proving that they can be the first to market with a foldable phone will do wonders for the brand&rsquo;s image. That&rsquo;s why beating Samsung&rsquo;s timeline and getting <em>something </em>(even if it&rsquo;s in the form of a small batch) is crucial. Experts at Nikkei have suggested that the executives at Huawei are keen to show off homegrown &ndash; a.k.a. right out of China &ndash;&nbsp;technological feats.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, this plan has been a long time coming. A spokesperson from BOE told Nikkei that the manufacturing of foldable screen displays in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, Sichuan Province started last year. Since then, two more manufacturing sites have opened up in the same province.</p>

<h2>The Future of Foldable Phones</h2>
<p>Regardless of who gets there first, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that foldable phones will be with us soon. How they will look, function, and whether they will be worth the hype is all up in the air right now. Sure, they will be a novel new addition to the modern-day line-up of phones, but let&rsquo;s hope that they are also useful and practical. We&rsquo;ll have to wait until next year to find out!</p>
