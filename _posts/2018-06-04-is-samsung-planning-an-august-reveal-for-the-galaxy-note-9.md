<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We heard it through the grapevine!</span></p>
<p>Have you got a thirst for the latest technology? The minute you&rsquo;ve got a brand-new phone, do you start fantasising and dreaming about what the next big thing might be? We hear you! The world of smartphones is moving so darn fast that it&rsquo;s always thrilling to imagine the joys that could be coming our way soon enough.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re waiting for the Galaxy Note 9 (or whatever the next Samsung flagship phone may be called) to hit stores, you might not need to wait much longer.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-01/samsung-is-said-to-plan-camera-revamp-for-aug-9-note-unveiling?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from Bloomberg, the mega-company could be planning to reveal its new all-singing, all-dancing device on&hellip;</p>
<p>*drum roll*</p>
<p>... 9th August! Pop that date in your diary.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17645" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/muGpjBoKgiGbfFbMz3wDk8luwAhAoMLP5nI11I44NsRYfhKlSQ7tPC5piBYocgbkb08VBljaJQK4ydxv_87VF5g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, it should be noted that there is no official word on when the smartphone will be released just yet. All we know at the moment is that the people at Bloomberg have word from some mysterious &lsquo;people familiar with the matter.&rsquo; We can&rsquo;t take that for gospel. That said, the idea that the phone will come out in August isn&rsquo;t all that outlandish.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Note 8 was announced back in August 2017 and then launched the following month in September 2017. The announcement came as part of an &lsquo;Unpacked&rsquo; event over in New York and Bloomberg suggests that there will be a similar spectacular taking place this coming year. Watch this space!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17662" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kbQCR6dAJ1iv0r0J-W62d84AVrfR2jAascsYw206i3tibOKuNXROsHG4UAw2nEV2BB6oG1upgQn7gxJzlZXkhycY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;re not even 100% sure that the phone will be called the Galaxy Note 9. While Samsung has been following that pattern for quite some time when it comes to the Note series, the powers behind the brand may shake things up. Some have speculated that the device could be released in late August, rather than in September.</p>
<p>So, what can we expect when the phone appears? Well, we&rsquo;ve already heard some interesting <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/samsung-galaxy-note-9-rumours-price-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumours about the Note 9</a>. Plus, this latest report from Bloomberg suggests that the device itself will be a progression of Note designs we&rsquo;ve seen in the past. The idea is that the main area in which the phone will have advanced will be the camera. Interesting&hellip; and not all that unlikely.</p>

<p>Sadly, there&rsquo;s no solid word on what we can expect at the moment. As is always the way, the people at Samsung are keeping their lips tightly sealed when it comes to any upcoming devices or products. Everything we <em>think </em>we know so far is little more than mere speculation. To find out the facts, we&rsquo;ll have to be patient!</p>
