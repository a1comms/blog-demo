<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">But Instagram&rsquo;s live video boasts a unique feature Facebook doesn&rsquo;t have.</span></p>
<p>Imagine a world where you didn&rsquo;t have to pre-record a video for Instagram. You could just press a button and start streaming live to the public, like your very TV show.</p>
<p>Well, that world is about to become the one you&rsquo;re already living in. The people behind the popular photo sharing app are set to bring out a brand new feature - Live Video in Stories. Exciting, right?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11459" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/jonah-hill-excited.gif" alt="jonah-hill-excited" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<p>So, what will this feature actually do? Well, it will mean that you can stream to-the-minute videos of yourself (or anything else) to your friends, family, and the wider public on Instagram. Users will be able to tune in by clicking your video symbol and watch whatever you&rsquo;re recording in real time. No pressure to entertain!</p>
<p>The techies behind this latest idea say it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;new way for people to connect and interact with their friends right now,&rdquo; but is it <em>really</em>?</p>
<p>If this is all sounding strikingly familiar to you, there&rsquo;s a good reason for that. The feature sounds a whole lot like the one Facebook launched earlier this year, called Facebook Live.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one difference between Instagram&rsquo;s Live Video and Facebook Live, though, and you might like it. While the videos on Facebook stick around forever after the whole live streaming malarkey is over, the ones on Instagram disappear in just 24 hours. Aaaand it&rsquo;s gone!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge difference, but it&rsquo;s enough to differentiate the two. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the first time that Instagram has launched a feature that we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere first. Back in August, when it launched Stories, many people noticed it was basically the same as Snapchat&rsquo;s Stories.</p>
<p>It all seems a little fishy, am I right? Actually, the CEO of Instagram, Kevin Systrom, makes no secret of the fact that he is inspired by what others do in the industry.</p>
<p>Systrom opened up to Wired, saying, "When I look at the tech world, I see interesting things happening in the different formats we care about: video and photo. I pay a lot of attention to that to figure out how we can remix ideas or come up with very original things ourselves."</p>

<p>Whether Instagram has &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; the live video feature or not (they totally did, but since it&rsquo;s owned by Facebook, we can&rsquo;t see any big fallouts), it&rsquo;ll still be a neat little extra to add to the app.</p>
<p>So, when will live video on Instagram be available? Well, many users were able to start testing it last week, but it&rsquo;s not widely available just yet. If you&rsquo;re not one of the select few who have it now, you may have to wait a little longer. Just keep checking the App Store or Google Play store!</p>
