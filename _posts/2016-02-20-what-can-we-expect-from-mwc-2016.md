<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s that time of year again! Yes, it&rsquo;s time to get a brew, settle into your chair, and wait for all the big new unveilings from Mobile World Congress (unless you&rsquo;re actually <em>in</em> Barcelona for the mobile world&rsquo;s biggest event, in which case enjoy yourself and have a glass of vino collapso for us).</span></p>
<p>But what might we be seeing in this coming week? Which new phones are we going drooling this time next week?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>Samsung</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, here; few people would bet against the Samsung Galaxy S7 being the star of the show. At this point, wondering what the next Galaxy will be like is almost a moot point, because are pretty much guaranteed to buy it (and its curved sibling, the Galaxy S7 Edge) by the bucketload.</p>
<p>Still, in terms of specs, we&rsquo;re potentially looking at a 5.1-inch screen (5.5-inch in the case of the Galaxy S7 Edge), a super-fast processor (an Exynos 8890 or Snapdragon 820, depending on market), a massive 4GB of RAM, and a 12MP camera. Oh, and unlike last year&rsquo;s Galaxy S6, the phone is said to once again be waterproof.</p>
<p>We can't wait to find out!</p>
<h2>LG</h2>
<p>If Samsung&rsquo;s bringing the A-game, LG can do no less, and so, we&rsquo;re expecting the LG G5 to be a properly fantastic smartphone. It&rsquo;s said to feature an all-metal design, giving it a true premium feel (previous G-series phones had plastic bodies, designed to <em>mimic</em> metal).</p>
<p>In addition, it&rsquo;s said to have a 5.6-inch 2K screen, which will feature an &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; display (as in, it will display things like time and date even when the screen is powered down), plus a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a combo of fingerprint sensor and dual camera on the back.</p>
<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>HTC, meanwhile, might be taking a different approach, as we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> expecting to see the next HTC flagship (the supposed One M10, codenamed Perfume) at MWC. Instead, we expect HTC to focus on its VR headset, the Vive. That headset is intriguing, as it&rsquo;s being co-developed by Valve (perhaps this is what Valve&rsquo;s been working on instead of Half-Life 3), but it&rsquo;s yet to be made clear just what benefits it will bring to smartphone users.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe MWC 2016 will be the venue where we find out <em>why</em> we should want a Vive?</p>
<h2>Sony</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there is no indication that Sony will be unveiling any new flagships at MWC 2016. The Japanese company does have a media event scheduled fr Monday morning, but rumours have consistently pointed to that event being about mid-range devices, so we fully expect to <em>not</em> be seeing the Xperia Z6.</p>
<h2>Huawei</h2>
<p>Huawei came out of nowhere a couple of years ago, and despite still having less brand recognition than the big names, the company does surprise us every now and then by unveiling a phone that makes us go, &ldquo;<em>Wait, what? Whoa!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year, that phone might be the 5.2-inch Huawei P9, because while rumours about it are thin on the ground, one thing those rumours do speak about is the RAM; in short, if they&rsquo;re accurate, the Huawei will have a massive <em>6GB</em> of RAM!</p>
<p><em>Wait, what? Whoa! </em></p>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>Moving away from Android, we come to Microsoft and Windows 10. We&rsquo;re not expecting to see any top-end flagships, but the buzz is that we&rsquo;ll see some more budget-friendly Lumia phones. Plus, we should get to see more of the Continuum feature in action (i.e. plug your phone into a special dock, and it transforms into a PC), and that&rsquo;s <em>always</em> worth seeing.</p>
<h2>Blackberry</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to the company that seems sadly fated to always be in the doldrums. Yes, it&rsquo;s Blackberry, and rumours suggest that we&rsquo;ll be seeing Android-powered versions of the Passport and the Vienna at MWC. It does feel slightly odd to see Blackberry switching over development to Android phones, but if it helps them stay in business, then it&rsquo;s a very smart move indeed!</p>
