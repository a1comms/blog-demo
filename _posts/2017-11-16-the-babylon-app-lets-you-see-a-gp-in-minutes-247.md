<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This could be the future of medical advice.</span></p>
<p>As cold season is now fully upon us - <em>achew</em> - you may be spending more time in your doctor&rsquo;s waiting room. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s not a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Whittling away hours of your day in a draughty, noisy room, hoping to see a medical expert is no way to spend your time. What if there were an easier way?</p>
<p>Well, now there is. Say hello to Babylon, the app that provides instant medical advice. Anytime, anywhere.</p>
<h2>Video-Chat with a GP</h2>
<p>Rather than having to pull yourself out of bed to go to the surgery, there&rsquo;s now a simple way to get the help you need. Babylon allows you to video chat with a GP in mere minutes.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDk0HYFNLKU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Video chats are available 24/7, and can be arranged with the touch of a button on your phone. Nothing could be easier, right?</p>
<p><em>Note: The video chat feature is only available for paying users. </em></p>
<h2>Get Health Advice</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might not need to see a doctor face-to-face, but do need some questions answered.</p>
<p>So, for any medical advice, there&rsquo;s a chat function built into the app, and all you do to get the help you need is send a message, and answer a few questions. This should be quick, easy, and free.</p>

<h2>Prescriptions Delivered</h2>
<p>Forget going to the chemist to pick up your prescriptions. Babylon solves that problem too.</p>
<p>Once a doctor has prescribed you medication, you can get it delivered right to your door. The app offers next day delivery all over the UK, and same day delivery in the London area. Yes, you can essentially order your medication like you would a take-away. Weird, but convenient.</p>

<h2>Track Your Test Results</h2>
<p>Babylon also tracks your fitness and activity levels throughout the day. But wait, there&rsquo;s so much more to it than that. Using this app, you can also track any test results that you may get from your doctor. That means you&rsquo;ll have a complete overview of your general health right on your phone.</p>
