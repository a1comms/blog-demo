<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple wants you to &lsquo;share your gifts&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finally December, which means that you&rsquo;re officially allowed to put up that tree and start cranking your favourite Christmas tunes. It also means that the telly (and the internet) is about to be flooded with heart-wrenching festive adverts.</p>
<p>Yes, &lsquo;tis the season to have a good old weep at a commercial while drinking hot chocolate and curling up under a cover.</p>
<p>Last year, Apple&rsquo;s Christmas <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/apple-christmas-ad-latest-video-iphone-x-airpods-advert-palace-sam-smith-update-a8072221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advert</a> was all about the hardware &ndash;&nbsp;showing off the Airpods and how they could bring a couple together. It was pretty sweet. However, the tech company has upped their game once again and you&rsquo;re not going to want to miss its 2018 offering. The short animated film with the simple message, &lsquo;share your gifts.&rsquo; Intrigued? Of course, you are. Watch it here for yourself.</p>

<p>The enchanting Apple Christmas film opens on a snow-covered scene and looms in toward a top-floor apartment. Inside, there&rsquo;s a woman working hard on her Macbook on some secretive project. When she&rsquo;s done, she prints off her mysterious work, looks at it, and then locks it tightly away in a box. The message is clear. Right now, she is not ready to share her gifts with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Throughout the Apple Christmas film, we see the main character&rsquo;s flair for creativity take on many different forms. In her job at a bakery, she carefully crafts a dog out of dough, before squishing it the moment someone else walks by. Later, on the bus, she draws a picture on the window pane and then wipes it away, embarrassed that someone will see.</p>

<p>Of course, I won&rsquo;t ruin the ending but, rest assured, there&rsquo;s a pretty magical way that the main character manages to share her work with the world. By the end of the Apple Christmas film, you&rsquo;re certain to have a smile on your face and maybe a tear in your eye as well. The brand has managed to tap into a wholesome idea; one that we all have something to offer that we could be holding out on.</p>
<p>Aside from the adorable story, there&rsquo;s also a soft and alluring soundtrack to keep you entertained. If you&rsquo;re wondering what the song from the Apple Christmas ad is, wonder no more. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Come Out and Play&rsquo; by 16-year-old Californian singer, Billie Eilish. It might be worth checking her out on Spotify or Apple Music right now as she&rsquo;s touring with Florence and the Machine in the new year too.</p>
