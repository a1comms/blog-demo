<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Are you ready for the next iPhone?</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With September looming over us (a mere four months away), there are already rumours flitting around about the new iPhone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As tradition dictates, Apple will likely release a line of new devices when autumn comes around. Before then, industry experts are left to scratch their heads, wonder and speculate about what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With that in mind, we&rsquo;ve picked out some of the tastiest rumours about the upcoming iPhone devices.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>New iPhone Models to Have Triple Lens Camera</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s talk cameras. What can we expect when the new models drop? At the start of the year, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-11-render-reveals-a-triple-lens-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one leak suggested</a> that the next iPhone would have a triple lens setup on the rear.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, there are new rumours floating around surrounding this idea and one is a particularly interesting snippet you might want to hear about.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The latest is a <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1113931393267130369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">tweet</a> from Steve H. McFly which suggested &nbsp;that the setup would not be exclusive to any individual iPhone that comes out this year. That means that all of the iPhone models that are released &ndash; including the possible update to the XR model &ndash;&nbsp;could have the same setup. That would mean an excellent camera offering all around.</p>

<h2>Square Rear Lens Setup</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, if Apple does go ahead with the triple lens setup, one of the biggest questions on people&rsquo;s mind is: how will it look?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t know the answer just yet, one render from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-37074.html" target="_blank">Mac Otakara</a> shows an attractive option. Rather than having the lenses in a strip running horizontally or vertically on the phone, the mockup shows a square design.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo80-YO-29M","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The grid would have a similar style to the rear setup that we&rsquo;ve already seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and would house all three of the lenses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It would be a major design change for the likes of Apple but could well work in the company&rsquo;s favour. After all, putting more emphasis on the camera features can only be a positive thing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>TrueDepth and 10MP Selfie Camera</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The rear cameras may not be the only ones that are getting a makeover this year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.compareraja.in/blog/compareraja-exclusive-iphone-xi-2019-will-feature-10mp-selfie-camera-lightning-port-rear-camera-details-leaked-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">report</a> from CompareRaja suggests that the next iPhone model will have a 10-megapixel selfie camera as well. That could mean some major changes for the existing TrueDepth Camera System. For some time, there have been rumours to suggest that this may change.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the report, the next incarnation of the iPhone may also include a flood illuminator on the front of the device.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The feature would decrease the impact of external light which should mean that Face ID is more accurate than ever before. Exciting stuff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Brand New Power Sharing Feature</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s an exciting new feature that may well be in store for Apple users. Yes, the next lineup of iPhone could support power sharing technology.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That means that you may be able to charge up other wireless gadgets using the rear of your phone as a pad.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This piece of gossip was recently <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/01/bilateral-wireless-charging-2019-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by 9-to-5 Mac, based on insights from the famous tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The general idea is that each of the devices will include a larger battery pack, which will support this nifty charging feature too. As other smartphones already have this feature, it wouldn&rsquo;t come as a big surprise at all.</p>
