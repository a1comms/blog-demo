<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Really? This is the name Samsung has decided on...?</span></p>
<p>As the world waits patiently for Samsung Galaxy S8 to hit our stores, there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation about the many features the phone may possess. With any luck, the latest Samsung gadget will be a little less um, fiery than the last. Am I right?</p>
<p>While Samsung hasn&rsquo;t given too much away yet, the company has hinted that the Galaxy S8 will boast a brand new voice assistant (Siri, watch out!).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no great secret that Samsung has been working on an advanced AI platform, dubbed <em>Viv</em>, but we&rsquo;re not certain what the plan is to call their phone assistant. But we do have an idea&hellip;</p>
<p>While rumours are flying left, right, and centre, there may be an easy way for us to discover what the new voice system will be called. Samsung has yet to release anything official, but with a little detective work, the answer may be plainer than you think.</p>
<h2>Samsung's Rival to Siri</h2>
<p>According to SamMobile, the top secret name of Samsung&rsquo;s upcoming AI voice has already been revealed. A straightforward trademark filing over in South Korea, Sammy&rsquo;s home country, looks to have revealed all, without the tech giant having to say a thing.</p>
<p>The trademark filing is for a word used in "computer software for personal information management" and "computer software for enabling hands-free use of a mobile phone through voice recognition". Sounds a lot like a voice AI system, if you ask us! So, what&rsquo;s the name? Well, the filing protects the word&hellip; *drum roll*... <em>Bixby</em>.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Where to start?</p>
<p>Bixby sounds like a cross between a breakfast cereal and a Furby, that fury talking toy you had as a kid. Or a catchphrase blurted out by Facejacker character Brian Badonde.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that this <em>is</em> the final name Samsung will stick with, especially if Sammy&rsquo;s getting the sought of reaction we think it is&hellip; Trademark filings don&rsquo;t always reveal the names of products and, who knows, Samsung may have something else up its sleeve.</p>
