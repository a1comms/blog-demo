<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Meet the iPhone of the future!</span></p>
<p>We all hoped Apple would announce a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/breaking-iphone-8-8-plus-and-iphone-x-are-finally-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>truly</em> <em>special</em> iPhone this year</a>. And as you surely know by now, we weren&rsquo;t left disappointed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an ultra-high-end smartphone from Apple, with more features than you can handle, you&rsquo;re in luck. Come and meet iPhone X.</p>
<h2>Design: Say Bye-Bye to Bezels</h2>
<p>The bezeless trend has been catching on across the market, and now Apple is getting in on the action, too. The only feature that&rsquo;s not screen on iPhone X is the small cut-out at the top of the device. The effect is seriously dramatic &mdash;&nbsp;iPhone X is more screen than phone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bs_AQejjL-g1UzUTaHa8pVnh_JlfDkGp969l2FVyfaflS2O3x0bmHi2-QsJuz347Wb5GS7pe_5Kc5IhxnkNdtUTr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, the home button is well and truly gone. The screen spans right to the bottom of iPhone X, which means that there&rsquo;s simply no room for any buttons. And so, the design looks completely fresh, radical even. This is one of the most minimal flagship devices on the market right now, which is what makes it so utterly appealing.</p>
<p>Flip iPhone X over and you&rsquo;ll see the rear is fashioned from solid glass. It&rsquo;s quite a change from the metal casing we&rsquo;ve all gotten used to by now, and yet it really does work. Unlike previous glass models, there are no harsh edges, and instead the curved nature of the exterior works to create a smooth, easy-to-hold finish.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14933" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RfiV3K7Qd9y8k8wcW7Z8ODAvabQ5nFBAAfLXS_zqYdPRNEgR_YTRG0rZIfeO9zfdyuELOczxLXUUxPfN8PvWSwzn=s0" alt="" width="600" height="311" /></p>
<h2>Display: Truly Remarkable</h2>
<p>Since the screen is the main attraction, the display quality on iPhone X has a whole lot to live up to. Luckily, the brand new Super Retina HD resolution pulls it out of the bag in all manner of ways, offering detail in 2436 x 1125 pixels. That means the resolution is sharper and crisper than it has ever been before &mdash;&nbsp;something that is certain to impress Apple fans who love their media.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmEqgjT61FA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, iPhone X comes with a whole host of exciting new features so the display specs really need to be up to scratch. Thankfully, initial reviews suggest that the high-quality display is more than users will need here. It seems that this phone really is leading the way.</p>
<h2>Camera: Depth Sensing Splendour</h2>
<p>It should go without saying that the camera has been upgraded in a rather serious way. Both sensors have been treated to optical image stabilisation, which means that users get a high-quality image in most modes that they may choose.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14961" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ip6mmqgMO8Myp_hKrgtN7z75QLBWDj9W6ck4EDLh5TpLQ-Vdi0uSMRAouHoilLB2tXNsuSjBo3bzUGd66KdMZY_Cqg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a telephoto lens, much like the one that we&rsquo;ve seen on the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a>. While these upgrades are cool, they are by no means the main selling point here&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s <em>all </em>about the depth sensor. The True Depth camera is something very special indeed; it&rsquo;s the very thing that will allow the Face ID feature to work (but we&rsquo;ll get to that later). What&rsquo;s more, the front camera is rather impressive and can sense all manner of things, including its user&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14960" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2mp81TJFmUXWwMvWGV59n3AJYBimM18Uc2lduf1dN10L8RCFUPoIPRT4gr7RWEcJoTbCZO4lbNiBDnCOjlwYxJU=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Portrait Lighting, an intelligent little feature in itself. The idea is that it figures out which part of the image is the subject (the person you&rsquo;re snapping) and highlights it within the picture. In theory, this should create some stunning portraits in a mere instant.</p>

<h2>Performance: More Power Than Ever</h2>
<p>Of course, cramming all the above into just one smartphone requires plenty of power to run it. Well, never fear! iPhone X boasts the brand-new A11 Bionic chipset, which means that it&rsquo;s certain to pack a serious punch. The result is a faster, more efficient phone which won&rsquo;t let users down.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mW6hFttt_KE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But wait just a minute, what about the battery life? Well, Apple has promised that user time won&rsquo;t be impacted by the fancy new iPhone X features. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s rumoured that this iPhone has a new 10-nanometer manufacturing processor, which should help make everything quicker than before.</p>
<h2>Features: Change, Change and More Change</h2>
<p>For a while, the good folk at Apple have generally kept things familiar, opting for incremental improvements over anything too dramatic. Well, that&rsquo;s all about to change&hellip; In a big way. The new features that iPhone X is packing are serious game-changers.</p>
<p><strong>Face ID: So Long Touch ID</strong></p>
<p>One of the major new features that&rsquo;s got everyone talking, is Face ID. Yes, rather than unlocking your device using your fingerprint (Touch ID), you can simply glance at iPhone X and watch it unlock.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14936" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_UBvRRgO6WLkTyUxDjr5CbdqUDpRgJgJpbMD_RZeSrurZRgZh4_E0_nN3ViFZGiAvNau7tDJ-yTGkiUgY8c6Dj4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The idea is that your device &lsquo;learns&rsquo; the map of your face over time, and so the more you use this, the better it will work. And it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> just for unlocking your iPhone X; Face ID will authorise payments and other permission-based actions, too.</p>
<p><strong>Animoji: Become a Talking Poop</strong></p>
<p>Using the same technology as Face ID, there&rsquo;s a new Animoji feature that allows you to create completely unique emoji in an instant. Again, the True Depth camera maps out your face and masks it using an emoji outline. That means that whatever you do, your on-screen emoji mimics your expression. Send video messages or snapshot emoji with this fun, new feature. That's right, you can become a talking poop!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14937" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5X2dGdYx_uQKpjtyjnDH5VbbKw4mUL19lwEgRqxdyc2mt5fC7epgB_cVkRxBdOPR0CAeU3UjwSUsoSC4HxpJSkrV=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Wireless Charging: The Future is Here</strong></p>
<p>Just when you thought that things couldn&rsquo;t get any better, Apple goes and introduces wireless charging to its iPhone range. All you need to do is place your iPhone X on a compatible Qi charging plate, and it&rsquo;ll start juicing up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14962" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hwRLf6VtBxywl5OV980JsHUJngzlK6MbnQiG9HfyvyrW5De36ttB7o7Da59a63xAjWd3kV2UQtTMMwziojEYdQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While wireless charging is by no means a new feature for smartphones, it is for iPhone, and more importantly it&rsquo;s likely to stimulate its use in the real world. In the near future, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll walk into a caf&eacute;, sit down with a drink and place your iPhone on the table, with built-in wireless charging, and power up your device all the while.</p>

<h2>iPhone X Price and Release Date</h2>
<p>Prices for iPhone X start at &pound;999, for the 64GB model. If you need extra storage, the 256GB version comes in at &pound;1149.</p>
<p>When can you get your hands on this little piece of the future? Right now, the launch date is set for 3 November (put it in your diaries, guys!), with pre-orders from 27 October. So, if you&rsquo;re absolutely swept away by Apple&rsquo;s latest offering, you don&rsquo;t have long to wait until you can nab it!</p>
