<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Scheduled&nbsp;for an early September announcement, 'iPhone 6s' is now tantalisingly close.</span></p>
<p>Like any iPhone launch, this year has witnessed crazy amounts of speculation.</p>
<p>Rather than wasting your time wading through it all, we&rsquo;ve pooled what we <em>think </em>are the plausible rumours, to give you an idea of what <em>might</em> happen this year.</p>
<p>If I hadn't just made it clear,&nbsp;everything that's detailed here is solely speculation.</p>
<h2>Rumoured Features</h2>
<p>[list type="check"]</p>
<ul>
<li>12MP iSight camera</li>
<li>Force Touch</li>
<li>A9 processor</li>
<li>2GB RAM</li>
<li>Enhanced Touch ID</li>
<li>Same look as iPhone 6</li>
<li>Sturdier design</li>
<li>New rose gold colour</li>
</ul>
<p>[/list]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What to Expect on iPhone 6s</h2>
<p>Based on Apple&rsquo;s release trend, we think that we&rsquo;ll see two iPhones launched this autumn. And they&rsquo;ll probably be called 'iPhone 6s' and 'iPhone 6s Plus'.</p>
<p>According to some 'analysts', it&rsquo;s possible that Apple could leapfrog the &lsquo;s&rsquo; naming handle, and head straight for 'iPhone 7'. Sure, it&rsquo;s <em>possible</em>, but will it happen? <em>Naaaah</em>, we doubt it<em>.</em></p>
<p>So presuming it&rsquo;s called 'iPhone 6s', the name then becomes indicative of an incremental upgrade rather than a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>That being said, if the rumours are anything to go by, iPhone 6s could offer some of the most radical changes seen from an &lsquo;s&rsquo; variant.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The most exciting of which, is the alleged camera upgrade that might see the 8MP iSight unit bumped up to 12MP, and engineered with a two-lens system for DSLR quality photos.</p>
<p>Low-light performance will allegedly eclipse all previous iPhone cameras, thanks to depth mapping. And the idea of 3D photography is being mentioned by some sources&hellip;</p>
<p>In addition, this fabled 12MP iSight camera is said to wield&nbsp;4K video recording capabilities, which is really only something for users who own a 4K TV. Sadly, that isn't me.</p>

<h2>Display / Force Touch</h2>
<p>Following the success of their forerunners, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are presumed to sport the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, respectively.</p>
<p>But will they really be the same?</p>
<p>Last year, we were subjected to some pretty heavy rumours that iPhone 6 would flaunt a sapphire display, offering considerably more durability than current standards.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, be it production issues or cost, it didn&rsquo;t happen. But guess what? Those rumours are back, for iPhone 6s this time, though they still remain a bit of a long shot.</p>
<p>Something that looks more of a safe bet, however, is Force Touch.</p>
<p>Featured on Apple Watch and Apple&rsquo;s new MacBook, Force Touch is a pressure sensitive screen technology that&rsquo;s all but confirmed for the upcoming iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>What it does is enable new gestures by responding to increased amounts of pressure. In other words, by pressing your finger a little harder on the screen, you can launch different commands.</p>

<h2>Power</h2>
<p>As with every new iPhone, Apple will almost certainly integrate a new, faster and more efficient chipset. Last year&rsquo;s was the A8, which means this year&rsquo;s will probably be, wait for it, the A9.</p>
<p>Lots of seemingly well-informed sources are claiming that Apple will throw in an extra 1GB of RAM this year, bringing the total up to 2GB, and more in line with the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>Though, when it comes to iPhones, what might seem like a low amount of RAM, actually isn&rsquo;t a big deal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the hardware and software are so tightly integrated, that iPhones invariably deliver one of the smoothest user experiences out there.</p>
<h2>Touch ID</h2>
<p>With Apple Pay now permeating the UK retail scene (and having rolled out to the US last year), there&rsquo;s a much bigger focus on Touch ID, and demand for improvements.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see Apple upgrading its functionality for faster, less error-prone fingerprint reading.<br />
<strong><br />

<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>Remember, iPhone 6s will likely be&nbsp;an incremental update, so the exterior will remain largely the same. But another year of a device as eye-catching as iPhone 6 is fine by us.</p>
<p>The materials used in constructing its shell may change, though, with rumours pointing towards the use of 7000 series aluminium, which is 60 % stronger, and still very light.</p>
<p>If the current selection of gold, grey and silver isn&rsquo;t for you, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that Apple might be working on a fourth, rose gold, variant.</p>
<h2>Smaller iPhone 6c?</h2>
<p>One more thing. We keep hearing whispers of a third, smaller iPhone, dubbed iPhone 6c.</p>
<p>This elusive device is said to come in at 4-inches, wearing a similar costume to the current iPhone 5c. So it&rsquo;ll probably be moulded from plastic, and arrive in a selection of vibrant colours.</p>
<p>Whilst most seem to agree Apple is indeed working on a more compact iPhone, not many believe it will be released this year.</p>
<p>Sad times for those after a smaller iPhone. Then again, there&rsquo;s always iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, which both offer nicely condensed 4-inch displays.<strong><br />

<h2>Release Date</h2>
<p>September&rsquo;s probably starting to get a little big headed, because Apple keeps picking it as the month to unveil its new iPhones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting to the point where other months are beginning to question themselves, because, once again, September has secured yet another iPhone event.</p>
<p>The date, which has been one of the biggest question marks surrounding iPhone 6s, has now been confirmed&nbsp;as&nbsp;9 September, with a rumoured launch scheduled for around 18 September.</p>
