<p><span class="postStandFirst">WhatsApp has introduced a new feature that allows users to mark messages as &lsquo;unread&rsquo;. Beware, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can get away with ignoring them.</span></p>

<p>WhatsApp&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Mark as unread&rsquo; feature has rolled out to provide its users with visual reminders to reply to messages.</p>
<p>By holding your finger down on a conversation, you can tag it as &lsquo;unread&rsquo;, which becomes indicated by a small green circle.</p>
<p>This update, only available on Android at the moment, won&rsquo;t affect the two little blue ticks (within the conversation itself) that indicate a message has been read.</p>

<p>Once a message has been seen, it can&rsquo;t be unseen, seemingly.</p>
<p>Other new features include custom notification settings (found in 'Notifications'), as well as the option to mute chats for 8 hours, 1 week or an entire year, which can be done within the desired conversation. Both of these features already exist on iOS.</p>
<p>On top of that, users can also select a &lsquo;Low data usage&rsquo; (found in &lsquo;Chats and calls&rsquo;) option to reduce the amount of data used for voice calls. If you&rsquo;re working on a tight data allowance, this could prove invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>Nice work, WhatsApp.</strong></p>
