<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="center">Sony Xperia E3</h2>
<p>The Sony Xperia Z3 is one of the most gorgeous smartphones released in 2014, but what happens when you try and get that phone in a cheaper form? Simple! You get the brilliant Sony Xperia E3!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5968" alt="xperia-e3-white-1240x840-3efc5dea793e6699bf5a9eac937b99a9" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/xperia-e3-white-1240x840-3efc5dea793e6699bf5a9eac937b99a9-1024x693.jpg" width="768" height="519" /></p>
<p><strong>Looks</strong></p>
<p>Just like its top-end sibling, the Sony Xperia E3 is a perfect example of what might be called &lsquo;minimalist chic&rsquo;. The wide open front and back faces of the phone combine with the chamfered, rounded edges, to create a phone that looks fantastic (and it&rsquo;s even available in lots of colours, for the fashion-conscious)!</p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p>At 5MP, the Sony Xperia E3&rsquo;s camera is powerful enough to capture pin-sharp images, while keeping file sizes small enough to share photos online, through Facebook, Twitter, and other social sites, <i>without</i> running up a huge data bill!</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5967" alt="xperia-e3-gallery-03-1240x840-b4aa5819843459639398d8216ad5dbbe" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/xperia-e3-gallery-03-1240x840-b4aa5819843459639398d8216ad5dbbe-1024x693.jpg" width="768" height="519" />Powered by Android KitKat, the Sony Xperia E3 gives you everything you&rsquo;d expect from the world&rsquo;s most popular smartphone platform.

<p>While Windows Phone may not be quite as customisable as the Android interface you&rsquo;ll find in the Xperia E3, it has a slightly shallower learning curve, and it also happens to be one of the fastest, most responsive operating systems in the mobile world. Powerful, sleek, <i>and</i> intuitive? That sounds like a big win in our book!</p>
