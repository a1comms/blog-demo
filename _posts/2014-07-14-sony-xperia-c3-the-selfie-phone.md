<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony has unveiled the new Sony Xperia C3, a handset designed to be the perfect &lsquo;selfie phone&rsquo;. To that end, it comes with a 5MP front-facing camera, which even has an LED flash, meaning that it will be able to take better selfies than any other phone out there!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4590" alt="Sony Xperia C3" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/xperia-C3-green-1240x840-1327dfcd1e01d38174c84d878e7f8dae-1024x693.jpg" width="672" height="454" /></p>
<p>A rumour&rsquo;s going round, saying that <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/htc">HTC</a> is gearing up to release a &lsquo;selfie phone&rsquo;, but it turns out that someone has already beaten them to the punch; Japanese manufacturer has gone ahead and announced its own selfie phone.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/sony-boosts-selfie-trend-with-the-launch-of-xperia-c3-the-worlds-best-selfie-smartphone/">the official Sony blog</a>, it&rsquo;s called the <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-c3/specifications/">Sony Xperia C3</a>, and while it&rsquo;s resolutely a mid-range phone, it does have one feature to set it apart from the pack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4591" alt="Sony Xperia C3" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/xperia-C3-gallery-05-1240x840-9134fa3f8189bff4565dd3357f7a4d6a-1024x693.jpg" width="672" height="454" /></p>
<p>In terms of general specifications, the Sony Xperia C3 aims to be affordable rather than high-end. So, instead of the top-tier Snapdragon 801 you would find in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 (or, indeed, the Xperia C3&rsquo;s big brother, the Sony Xperia Z2), it uses a 1.2Ghz processor and 1GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5.5-inch screen comes in at 1280x720 pixels, putting it well below the current king of smartphone screens, the LG G3. Quite simply, though, high-end specs aren&rsquo;t the point, because the Sony Xperia C3 is designed around the idea of taking selfies, so what matters here is the camera, or more specifically, the front-facing camera. While the Sony Xperia C3 has an 8MP camera on the back, of a lot more interest is the 5MP wide-angle camera on the <i>front</i> of the phone.</p>

<p>That front-facing camera even has an LED flash, making it the <i>perfect</i> phone for taking selfies!</p>
<p><b>As of right now, the Sony Xperia C3 has been announced for the Chinese market, but we strongly suspect it will wend its way over to the rest of the world, including the UK, in due time. After all, the selfie is a worldwide phenomenon, and this might just be the perfect selfie phone! </b></p>
