<p>On the front of the phone we find a 4.7-inch 720p Super AMOLED display with a ppi of 312.The display is made from Corning Gorilla Glass, again making it durable, and the display is very crisp with excellent colours and superb vision in bright sunlight.</p>

<p>For audio connectivity there is a 3.5mm headset jack, whilst NFC is also featured allowing the use of Android beam and direct device connectivity options.</p>
