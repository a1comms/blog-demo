<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">VPNs are a must-have for keeping your internet browsing private.</span></p>
<p>VPNs (virtual private networks) are sort of a hot topic right about now, and for good reason. But what are they, and what to do they do?</p>
<p>A VPN connects you to the internet via a server that&rsquo;s run by a VPN provider. Any data travelling between your device and the VPN server is encrypted.</p>
<p>Put simply, it keeps your internet browsing private. And lets you get around censorship and geo-restricted content.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard of VPNs before, but never used them, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here are some of the best free ones on the market and what they offer once you start using them.</p>
<h2>1) Hotspot Shield Free</h2>
<p>If you happen to use public WiFi a lot of the time, Hotspot Shield Free might just be the VPN for you, because it&rsquo;ll protect you from hackers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13803" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/To92MxWSOBgfPGvHflgEubYq-hPxEEz0bUIQKGH4t61myntgoTkNZpGuLZOHCyJQdX-NgxhrZeXbyGq5wXHUj04=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed this particular piece of software, you&rsquo;ll find that it starts working whenever you connect to a wireless spot that is &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo; (or unknown to your device).</p>
<p>That means that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about switching Hotspot Shield Free on once you have it. Instead, you can simply leave it running in the background and let it do the hard work for you. What&rsquo;s more, this VPN offers you a bandwidth daily limit of 750MB.</p>

<h2>2) Windscribe</h2>
<p>While this one is still quite new, it&rsquo;s worth paying attention as it has a seriously good bandwidth limit, offering a whopping 10GB per month. Realistically, that means that Windscribe is ideal for day to day internet use, though you may struggle if you happen to watch a load of videos or need to download a load for work.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13804" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TGb2F9_YPh3zidEW69v9sPdwDfz3d1ZSMsH3Tlai9-zAliTTu7YVqp4kguQehDbiQXNS0dE63oU8EdD6fKEa7zAl=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>If you tweet about the service, you can bag yourself an extra 5GB data. Oh, and when you invite a friend (and they join), you nab another 1GB of data. So, the more you let people know about this service, the more data you will end up getting. Clever.</p>

<h2>3) TunnelBear</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re completely new to using VPNs, TunnelBear may well be a good place to start. Unfortunately, you won&rsquo;t be able to use this all the time, unless you&rsquo;re willing to pay for it. The free version of this VPN gives you a limit of 500MB per month. To increase it, check out the full subscription.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13805" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3lWoIe3-u6jhn5V4d5UuGho5f9xwyDrNTcuFq60id34ZS2SILZ9Rceno4sTCHg0Go5oTS4LfFfScfAPC_cNMuEwOGw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>With this VPN, you have the ability to choose from 20 different countries to use as your adopted location. It&rsquo;s super easy to use and if you happen to be a casual internet-user, it&rsquo;s certainly the way to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/b/get-started/?aff_id=2940&amp;offer_id=40&amp;trans_id=102b8c36af15a148aa6f9772cb0f8f&amp;utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=FreeHoney" target="_blank"><strong>>> </strong>Download TunnelBear for free</a></p>
<h2>4) Private Tunnel</h2>
<p>One of the best things about Private Tunnel is the fact that you can use it on so many devices. This particular VPN has a whole load of versions that you can download in mere seconds. From Windows and Mac to Android and iOS, there are just so many versions of this VPN that you really have no excuse for not using it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13806" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DYQT-oe3FAC_iOa3BWbpZsUQMh_QvmvCEy3-lJy6CkNy4pzaHM20NmVTgAVcoy4V-9rb4SCKvv_k401QgxBL3yUe=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you first sign up for PrivateTunnel, you will be able to use 200MB of data which has no &lsquo;use by&rsquo; date. Fantastic. But, of course, there&rsquo;s a bit of a catch. Once you&rsquo;ve used all of that, you will need to pay for more. Eek. So, as a short-term solution to your VPN problems, this one may be fine.</p>

<h2>5) Freelan</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re completely new to VPNs, Freelan may not be for you. Getting this service and making it work is harder than many of the others out there. That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that it&rsquo;s 100% free all the time, once you&rsquo;ve fully downloaded it and started using it on a regular basis. We won&rsquo;t lie &mdash; it&rsquo;s not particularly easy. If you happen to understand the techy world, you may find that this is the one for you.</p>
