<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Hold it, squeeze it, never let it go! See&nbsp;the new phone everybody's talking about in this HTC U11 Review.</span></p>
<p>The wait is over. <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/watch-the-full-htc-u11-announcement-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTC has finally announced its flagship device</a> and soon enough, we'll all be able to get our hands on it. So, what does the HTC U11 really have in store for us? Here's just about everything you need to know about the latest device. Enjoy.</p>
<h2>Design: Liquid Surface</h2>
<p>The HTC U11 design may look somewhat familiar to fans of the brand. The reason is simple: it uses the Liquid Surface design style that&rsquo;s been seen on both the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play. The effect is a fully curved phone that looks completely modern &mdash;&nbsp;a superior design style for the smartphone market.</p>

<p>One of the major HTC U11 features that you&rsquo;ll notice here is the use of Gorilla Glass 5. It&rsquo;s that very material that allows for the strong and rounded style of the phone itself.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, HTC has a range of colour options available, which easily makes this one of the main contenders for &lsquo;flashiest smartphone of the year&rsquo;. You can nab the device in Solar Red, Amazing Silver, Brilliant Black, Sapphire Blue and Ice White. &nbsp;Each colour has a &lsquo;two-tone&rsquo; quality&nbsp;that changes in the right light.</p>
<h2>Display: Safe and Simple</h2>
<p>Just like the sumptuous design, the display will likely turn a few heads. HTC U11 features a 5.5-inch QHD display with Super LCD 5 technology, covered in a 3D glass screen that's designed to preserve image and video authenticity. We think you'll agree, it looks rather stunning.</p>

<p>What does it mean for you? Well, the result is&nbsp;sharp, crisp, and clear imaging, whether you're flicking through Instagram photos or streaming videos on Facebook.</p>
<p>Still, it doesn&rsquo;t have the 18:9 ratio screen that we&rsquo;ve seen on other flagship devices of late. Some may think that&rsquo;s a problem. However, the brand explained to TechRadar that they wanted to ensure that this was the right way to go before following the suit of other companies in the industry. Fair play.</p>

<h2>Camera: Enhanced Snaps</h2>
<p>Of course, the camera ought to be one of the main HTC U11 features, so what does it have to offer? Well, actual megapixel count hasn't been updated -&nbsp;it&rsquo;s still the 12MP sensor that we&rsquo;ve seen before now. Though, the camera does snap in RAW imaging format that may mean that you get enhanced photos every time.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are areas where the brand has upped its game a whole load. HTC has gone ahead and added a few extra features to the device that you may not have seen before now. For example, there&rsquo;s the HDR Boost and the new lowlight performance; both of which are impressive in themselves.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about what really matters&hellip; selfies. Luckily, the front-facing camera has been enhanced. You now have a 16MP sensor along with a panorama mode, which allows you to get a large group of people in your snaps. Excellent for parties.</p>

<h2>Performance: Fast and Slick</h2>
<p>When it comes to battery life, HTC has always followed the trends that have come and gone. With this latest phone, HTC has included a 3000mAh battery which is the same as the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8. That means that the device will last and last &mdash; at least, for as long as you might need it to do so.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13858" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yDxydDkIfRHlQeCzrJO21Sc6lRCE3ZZSfPiZvKrrcdlaQj90Nb-M5VvMRwYBcF1HLCLJY4mkvF2NU4X4xjY5ffyC=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Other than that, the chipset is on par with many on the market right now. That is to say that you won&rsquo;t see a major difference between this and other top-the-range devices like <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/lg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG G6</a> - which is a good thing, of course.</p>
<p>HTC U11 is fast enough and slick enough to use all the major features and functions. The average user should have no problem at all using the phone for just about everything they could need.</p>
<h2>Extras: Edge Sense</h2>
<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s the info you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. Let&rsquo;s talk for a moment about the squeezable Edge Sense function. It&rsquo;s at the heart of the HTC U11, so does it really live up to the hype? Well, maybe.</p>
<p>HTC U11's Edge Sense&nbsp;feature lets you&nbsp;squeeze the bottom half of the phone to interact with it. Getting used to the many different functions here may take some time to start with, but it&rsquo;s sure to be a lovable feature down the line.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IBPXSrFESM?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>For example, if you give the device a long squeeze, it opens Google Assistant, and a short one opens the camera. You can customise these features, though, so it&rsquo;s up to you how you use it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one bit of bad news right now: the Edge Sense function won&rsquo;t be enabled until July this year.&nbsp;It's a little disappointing, but we're happy to wait!</p>
<h2>Price Tag and Availability</h2>
<p>So, when can you get your hands on HTC U11? They're available to pre-order now, for delivery on 1 June 2017. If you want to be the first to get it, make sure you place your as soon as possible.</p>
