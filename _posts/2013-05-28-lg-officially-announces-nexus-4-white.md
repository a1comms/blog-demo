<p><span class="postStandFirst">After months of speculation the mysterious White LG Nexus 4 has finally been made official.</span></p>
<p>The true Android handset has had a fresh coat of paint. Now in a glossy white the new Nexus looks every bit as stylish as the original&nbsp;black Nexus 4.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/8273659/nexus4white_large_large.jpg" width="300" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What makes Nexus 4 devices so special is the fact they are pure-blood Android, meaning you get an unaltered stock Android experience and the freshest updates straight from Google.</p>
<p>The handset itself is a technical wonder, powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, this killer combo makes the Nexus 4 a very quick device indeed.</p>
<p>The front of the device is taken up by a 4.7 inch IPS HD display with a 320ppi and curved edges, allowing for easy edge-to-edge scrolling. There is no physical button present on the front giving a seamless flow to this excellent display.</p>
<p>The edge of the handset has sweeping bezels which are accompanied by a non-slip material around the sides of the phone, so it is easy to hold as well as comfortable.</p>
<p>Turn the phone over and the real difference between the black and white version comes to light. The holographic design of the original handset is still present and adds real depth to the white variant, with the shade being fresh, vibrant and really making the Nexus 4 stand out.</p>
<p>The device retains the wireless charging compatibility from the original as well as the excellent 8 megapixel camera, complete with the innovative Photosphere function, which allows for spherical images of your surroundings to be created.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed it is believed that the new Nexus 4 will be receiving an Android update from 4.2.2, the current version, to the new unnamed 4.3 variant.</p>
<p>The handset launches officially on the 29/05/13 and will be rolling out globally within the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>The Nexus 4 iss already a fantastic device and bringing out a fresh new colour will certainly give more and more people the chance to experience Android in its purest and most unadulterated form.</strong></p>
