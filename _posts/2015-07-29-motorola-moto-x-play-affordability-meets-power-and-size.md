<p><span class="postStandFirst">Motorola has announced the Moto X Play, the company&rsquo;s first budget phablet. With a ton of high-end features and a water-resistant body, all for a surprisingly low price. This might just be the phablet that people on tighter budgets have been waiting for!</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7588 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Moto_X_Play_Blue_White_Lifestyle.jpg" alt="<img src= https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Moto_X_Play_Blue_White_Lifestyle.jpg alt=&rdquo; Motorola Moto X Play&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="533" data-id="7588" /></p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing modern Motorola phones are known for, it&rsquo;s providing an astonishingly high level of value for money; we&rsquo;re hard pressed to think of any other manufacturer&rsquo;s phones that offer the same bang for your buck.</p>
<p>It looks like Motorola is planning to take on a whole new class of devices; the company has now announced the Moto X Play, and it is, in fact, Motorola&rsquo;s first budget <em>phablet</em>!</p>
<p>As with every modern Motorola phone, the specs are surprisingly brilliant for something which could realistically have &ldquo;budget&rdquo; as an adjective&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor, 2GB RAM, a whopping 5.5-inch HD screen, a 21MP camera on the back (as well as a 5MP selfie camera), up to 32GB of onboard storage (plus a microSD slot), and a ginormous 3630mAh battery that Motorola reckons will last for two whole days!</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Moto X Play also features &ldquo;TurboPower&rdquo; quick-charging, so when it <em>does </em>run out of juice, it won&rsquo;t take you long to fill it back up again.</p>
<p>Oh, and best of all? The Moto X Play is water-resistant. So you can feel more confident when reading in the bath, taking photos by the pool or when your phone&rsquo;s on the dinner table.</p>
<p>The Moto X Play is set to go on general release in August, and based on the low RRP, you can guarantee it will be available with some stunningly good deals.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for more info, because if you&rsquo;ve been waiting for a phablet that won&rsquo;t break the bank, you <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to miss out on this one! </strong></p>
