<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s the season to be jolly. Providing you can make all those family pit stops, and keep the kids entertained. Here's some apps to help you out.</span></p>
<p>If you want to go full OCD and get everyone to check-in just in time for Old Saint Nick, then these are the apps for you. Use your smartphone and keep your Christmas running smoothly, just like that brandy sauce on your Christmas pudding.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s a gift from us to you, with some of our favourite apps, perfect for the festive season.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15834" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P6zJegSKK9tKQUMoHsiAcAn2BsDDtA8SBf5D1GiFek5yOKhYmVe_VP101i8vI_pkunULRe2xqRIIDStnTbrwA-Dn=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>1) Send Your Invites and Get Everyone in the Diary</h2>
<p>Why not set up some family calendars. It's easy. There&rsquo;s a few you can choose from, it just depends where you prefer to hang out online.</p>
<p>iOS Calendar lets you share a private calendar event with others. It goes without saying that this one is ideal for an Apple household.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Google Calendar has a feature where-in you can create or share a group calendar with all the family and friends you want, so you can see where everyone needs to be and at what time. You will need a Gmail and Google account for this option though.</p>
<p>Alternatively, and one to suit all parties, a Private Facebook Event could be a solution for your one-off extravaganzas, like the big day itself, Christmas Day, or even New Year&rsquo;s Eve bashes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15835" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6lEdAIMbeiwvxopkJoBaRaG7IoNXFJoBuoNxovyEk_bP5P4bnPn0ztHPQ8vQbOLIUn7EMnv7SyFsS9U-Nfm30gsN=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>2) Set up the 'Obligatory' Group Chat</h2>
<p>Another great idea nowadays is to create a group chat. <em>Facebook Messenger</em> is always a good one, as you can now set up events from inside the group chat itself, and get handy reminder notifications along the way. You can also use polls in the group to decide what&rsquo;s on the Christmas buffet.</p>
<p>Another fan favourite is the <em>WhatsApp Group</em>. Similarly, this pretty much does everything that Messenger can do (apart from the polls or events). If you are specific about dates in the chat, you can easily add these to your device calendar on iOS, but not on Android. It generally comes down to personal preference though. Maybe set up a poll to decide...</p>

<h2>3) Sort the Essential Christmas Entertainment</h2>
<p>Most important of all is keeping everyone entertained, right? Especially the kids. Here&rsquo;s a few app games for your smartphone that will surely go down in family Christmas history.</p>
<p>The <em>Heads Up!</em> app game is free to download and comes with extra in-app purchases to expand the choice of categories. It&rsquo;s available for both Android and iOS and is as simple as pie. Select a category, place the phone on your head, and the people you&rsquo;re playing with have to describe what or who it is. Simples. Here's it in action on the Ellen&nbsp;DeGeneres Show.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PO_ezpX7DwY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Download Heads Up! on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> or the&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heads-up/id623592465?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Just Dance Now</em>&nbsp;app for Android and iOS is ideal for all the family. Get everyone up and dancing in the app version of the popular dance game. Using your smartphones as the controller, even grandma could have a go.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15841" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8JK4BXgGWZCrnnIreGIQMHn9dqFZTEEmr4YY_wcs92-lC_OjdhUBetTXZVEdwISvSVjhuspusSCbfUELdebHq09r=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Download Just Dance Now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.dance.JustDance&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> or the&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/just-dance-now/id833517462?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>.</em></p>
<p>A spin-off of a Christmas classic, the <em>Wurdy</em> party word game app can certainly spice things up from your traditional Pictionary. Essentially, you must describe the words to your friends or family, and they have to guess what the words are. The more you get, the more points you earn. Easy.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hB6CYIBv0YU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Download Wurdy on Google Play or the&nbsp;App Store.</em></p>
<p>This one is sure to generate a few laughs. To play <em>Psych!</em>, you will need a smartphone each and the app downloaded to join a game together. Catch out Uncle Frank with your smart, yet convincing answers to the questions, and score the most points.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdOIfd--P1M" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Download Psych! on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.ellen.psych&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> or the&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/psych-outwit-your-friends/id1005765746?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>.</em></p>
<h2>4) Keep the 'Tuneage' Lit (Just Like Those Christmas Candles)</h2>
<p>Make sure Grandma stays awake and indulge in those cult classic, fan favourite apps to keep the music going this Christmas. Create a collaborative playlist for all the family on <em>Spotify</em> or <em>Apple Music</em>, and let people add, remove or reorder what&rsquo;s up next.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zIW6R4bCyk0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, if your crazy aunt or bestie is into the likes of <em>Deezer</em> or <em>Tidal</em>, you can pretty much get the same service on Deezer as Spotify. Tidal however is lacking in certain areas; it&rsquo;s just down to preference at the end of the day, and how much you want to DJ.</p>
<h2>5) The Perfect Christmas Grub</h2>
<p>Get the emergency chairs around the table; it's food time. So if you want to know how to produce the perfect turkey or Christmas cake, a good start is always the <em>BBC Good Food</em> app. Giving detailed recipes and images, not to mention lots to choose from, to impress the crowds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15868" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sgwWc0UD_jfbBWf4E3flcMyQeyfqa_J8-d4HpiHoZ0lOrM4viHBUBn2Q76tv8hBOG4zHGeDTqIrvRYp8Q47Vx_DG=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Download the BBC Good Food app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.bbc.goodfood2&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> or the&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-good-food/id533785308?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>.</em></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of the TV channel, but the <em>Food Network</em> also has an app that's filled with awesome, tasty treats, perfect for impressing&nbsp;family and friends this Christmas.&nbsp;From cookies to turkey goodness, they&rsquo;ve pretty much got it covered.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K4HPDqbam8" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
