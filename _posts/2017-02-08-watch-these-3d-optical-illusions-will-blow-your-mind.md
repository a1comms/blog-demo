<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Seeing is <em>not </em>always believing&hellip; ready to have your mind boggled beyond belief?</span></p>
<p>Despite what we imagine, there is actually a real disconnect between our eyes and our brain a lot of the time. Even when the full picture is not available, our brains use what we know to make it seem as though it is. So, when what you&rsquo;re seeing in front of you makes absolutely no sense, your brain kicks in and starts filling in all of the blanks.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, what that means is that your mind tends to make certain assumptions about the information it&rsquo;s getting from your eyes. Often, though, there&rsquo;s a massive gulf of difference between reality and what your mind assumes is happening. Hence, an optical illusion is born!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve likely seen a whole bunch of illusions online before now. The internet is clogged up with puzzles and weird pictures that are sure to bend your mind. Most of the time, though, these images will be static. Boring, right? Well, brace yourself for something impressive. The following YouTube video shows some of the most mind-blowing 3D optical illusions you will ever see.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve just watched the video, you might need a minute&hellip; After watching something as strange as that, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to take a moment to digest what you&rsquo;ve just seen. If you feel as though your mind&rsquo;s been officially meddled with, don&rsquo;t worry. Most people simply cannot understand illusions like the ones in this video. After all, the 3D images you&rsquo;ve just witnessed don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So, where did all this come from? Well, these crazy illusions are the creation of genius Japanese professor, Kokichi Sugihara. Judging by his portfolio of similar tricks, it would seem that this guy has been creating illusions for quite some time now, which would explain why he&rsquo;s something of a pro. From &lsquo;Impossible Motions&rsquo; to &lsquo;Partly Invisible Objects,&rsquo; Sugihara has an extensive range of weird and wonderful illusions on his site.</p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, Sugihara was recognised for his work back in 2010, when he won the highly acclaimed <a href="http://illusionoftheyear.com/">Best Illusion of the Year Contest</a>. And that&rsquo;s not all! Last year, his illusions came in 2nd place for the same competition. It&rsquo;s clear to see that he is one of the leading people in this realm. Incredible! Well, our minds are blown.</p>
<p>Like what you saw? You can check out more of Sugihara&rsquo;s work here. But first, brace yourself for a terrible 90s website design, and then some seriously mind-bending illusions.</p>
