<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Spoiler: It&rsquo;s easier than you think!</span></p>
<p>Thinking of getting Apple&rsquo;s new HomePod, but not sure how it will work? Luckily, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. The geniuses over at the tech company have put together three fun videos that show you just what to do with the smart speaker.</p>
<p>From using Siri as a DJ (yes!), to resetting the device completely, these short and sweet clips guide you through every single step. So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what Apple&rsquo;s new HomePod has to offer, and how you can use it for yourself.</p>
<h2>How to Use Siri as Your Personal DJ</h2>

<p>Who needs to hire a DJ when you&rsquo;ve got a HomePod?</p>
<p>Using your smartphone to control your playlist is <em>so </em>last year. In the first of the three videos, Apple shows us how Siri can be your personal DJ. Oh, and it&rsquo;s super easy.</p>
<p>You just speak to Siri, and tell it what you want. You can choose from a specific genre of music or playlists that you&rsquo;ve already saved. You can also turn the volume up or down, skip songs, and so much more. Nice.</p>
<h2>How to Use HomePod&rsquo;s Touch Controls</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abOW_Cj0y5M" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with getting your head around communicating vocally with your HomePod, never fear&hellip;</p>
<p>It also has touch controls, which are just as easy to use, but make you feel a little less like you&rsquo;re in an episode of Black Mirror. You don&rsquo;t even need to say <em>Hey Siri</em> to get started!</p>
<p>Should you want to pause a tune, simply tap the top of HomePod once, and it will stop for a moment. Then, if you&rsquo;d like to skip to the next song, double-tap or triple-tap the top of the device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty darn simple to get used to these controls. As with all things Apple, nothing is overly complicated.</p>
<h2>How to Adjust HomePod&rsquo;s Settings</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qegtls2wtYk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, if you want to adjust your HomePod settings to suit your needs, you&rsquo;ll need your phone.</p>
<p>The third video shows you just how to do that. Simply open the Home App on your iPhone to get started. From there, you can control all manner of things and make sure that the device does just as it&rsquo;s told.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this feature means that you can change which accounts HomePod links to, and even go as far as blocking certain songs from being played on the device.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be super useful should you have some risqu&eacute; tunes on your playlist that you don&rsquo;t want anyone else to hear! Plus, you can reset the speaker and even link it to new devices too.</p>
