<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung is taking us back to basics, with its retro Samsung Galaxy LTD. Old is the new new.</span></p>
<p>Ever wish you could revert back to the days when mobile phones were <em>just </em>mobile phones? A time when <em>surfing</em> was reserved for waves, and the word <em>&lsquo;selfie&rsquo;</em> might have been mistaken for a supernatural creature.</p>
<p>The arrival of Samsung Galaxy LTD will bring all that back, and so much more.</p>
<p>Reviving the classic, brick-like look of the late 80s and early 90s, Samsung Galaxy LTD is cased in a robust and rectangular build, crafted from the highest grade of polycarbonate.</p>
<p>Its substantial size, weight and dimensions mean it can double as a baton to beat technology-obsessed youths, as well as serving as a stylish paperweight in between taking calls in the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Easy-Press buttons are optimised for maximum typing efficiency, guaranteed to keep productivity levels sky-high, whilst ensuring finger fatigue is kept at bay.</p>
<p>Shortcuts like Mute and Lock will save you seconds of time, allowing you to focus on life&rsquo;s more important tasks, like crimping your hair and solving your Rubik&rsquo;s cube.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll open the door to a whole world of nostalgic fun and games, featuring nigh-forgotten classics like &lsquo;Spin the Cell&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aerial Finger Fillet&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A Light-Up keypad illuminates the buttons for easy dialling, great for&nbsp;low light situations. An extendable aerial enhances signal for almost fuzz-free phone calls. And Samsung&rsquo;s largest ever battery means that street urchins will struggle to pick your pocket unnoticed.</p>

<p>Of course, we jest; Samsung Galaxy LTD is nothing more than Samsung&rsquo;s hilarious April Fools&rsquo; Day joke. Did they have you convinced? No doubt, there are countless banterific hoaxes circulating the web, but Samsung&rsquo;s is our favourite so far. Check it out here.</p>
<p><strong>The April Fools' Day fun doesn't stop there, though, because&nbsp;our April Fools&rsquo; Flash Sale is on until 4pm today. The deals are so good, the joke&rsquo;s on us!</strong></p>
