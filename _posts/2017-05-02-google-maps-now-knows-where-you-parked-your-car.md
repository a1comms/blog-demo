<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Dude, where's my car...? Google it.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You head out for a day trip to an area that you don&rsquo;t know so well, park up somewhere, and go exploring. When the day is done, and you want to find your car, there&rsquo;s just one <em>tiny </em>problem. You have no clue where you parked it. You may be able to vaguely picture the road in your mind&rsquo;s eye, but finding it is near impossible.</p>
<p>So, as a fun end to your day, you spend hours walking down street after street, lost and looking for your vehicle, asking, &ldquo;Dude, where&rsquo;s my car?&rdquo; But wait a minute&hellip; What if Google could tell you exactly where you left your car? Well, my friends, now it can!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13756" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ztxgCGcPP2_roM9NFObpGojbcNFKxFDS04O1xIlatiSiF_6TQuzDLwzhTw-qM6uuHAEMxWp2lMbDMXHk1OoSP5po=s0" width="600" height="252" /></p>
<p>The latest Google Maps feature keeps track of where you park your car. You just need to activate the feature to start using it. To do so, make sure your software is up to date, and you have the latest version of Maps installed on your device.</p>
<h2>Dude, There&rsquo;s My Car!</h2>
<p>So, how do you use Google&rsquo;s new car locator feature? Once you&rsquo;ve parked up, open up Google Maps and tap the blue dot that indicates your location. A menu should pop up with a <strong>Save your parking</strong> option on Android, or <strong>Set as parking location</strong> on iOS. You just need to tap it and Maps will save the location you&rsquo;ve parked at.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you happen to have left your vehicle in a difficult place to find (even with a map to guide you), never fear. You can add a set of notes or instructions to the location, so that you can find it with ease later on. Plus, you can save a quick snap of your parking space, as well, and even send the location to a contact so they can find it too. Genius!</p>
<p><em>Side note: Google Maps also has an &lsquo;automatic parking detection&rsquo; feature which you don&rsquo;t have to enable. However, it&rsquo;s likely to be less accurate than this latest feature and may not always be activated when you park up.</em></p>
