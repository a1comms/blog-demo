<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The Samsung Galaxy S8 is well and truly here, but how does it compare to the likes of the iPhone 7? We pit the two smartphones against one another and see which comes out on top!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a new phone, there are just so many options out there. Of course, two of the main devices you may consider come from tech giants, Apple and Samsung. Sure, the epic Galaxy S8 has just launched and it&rsquo;s a rather impressive phone, but how does it compare to the likes of the iPhone 7? We take a look at what the two phones have to offer and which one is right for you. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Which design you prefer really comes down to one thing: Do you want familiarity or do you want something completely new and snazzy?</p>
<p>As most of you will know by now, the iPhone 7 is extremely similar to the iPhone 6 in everything including the design, feel, and style of the phone. When the geniuses at Apple released the device last year, many were surprised at how little had really changed from device to device. The truth of the matter is that the latest incarnation of the iPhone comes with the same slick Apple design we&rsquo;ve come to know and expect. Perhaps the thinking here is that &lsquo;if something isn&rsquo;t broken, why should you fix it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, there&rsquo;s the Samsung Galaxy S8. This is a monster of a phone compared to previous devices and that&rsquo;s exactly the point. One of the main draws of the device is the so-called &lsquo;Infinity Screen&rsquo;, i.e. a screen that almost covered the phone in its entirety. When you compare the impressive 5.8-inch screen of the S8 to the standard 4.7-inch offering from the iPhone 7, there&rsquo;s no doubt which device is winning.</p>
<p>When it comes to the feel of the phones, there&rsquo;s a noticeable difference too. The Apple designers have strongly stuck to a tight, lightweight style for their flagship phone. That means that the iPhone 7 fits comfortable in the palm of your hand, and doesn&rsquo;t feel too hefty. The S8 is much larger in this department too, coming in at 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm (as opposed to the iPhone&rsquo;s 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm). In short, it&rsquo;s a much sturdier, yet slightly bulkier device.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>In recent years, smartphone displays have come on in leaps and bounds. Sadly, this is an area in which Apple has slowed. What that means is that, yes, you will get a much cleaner, sharper display when you choose to get a Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about what that S8 has to offer and the areas in which it has improved. We already know that it has a larger screen than ever and includes the so-called &lsquo;Infinity Display&rsquo;. You should also know that the phone has both a 18.5:9 aspect ratio and includes the QHD+ screen. So, the pixel density comes in at 567 ppi. Jargon aside, all of the above means that the device has one of the most impressive displays on the market right now.</p>
<p>When you compare all of this to the iPhone 7, there&rsquo;s hardly any competition here. The smaller screen packs just 750 x 1334 pixels and offers a mere 326 ppi. That&rsquo;s quite a significant difference and so if you happen to be looking for the sharpest screen out, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is certain to be the way forward.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>When it comes to power, you only have to look at the chipsets that each of the devices use. If you choose to nab yourself a Samsung Galaxy S8, you will ultimately get either the Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 835 or the Exynos 8895 chip. Both of which are built using the high-tech 10nm process. That should mean that the S8 is faster than its predecessors and uses up less power in general as well.</p>
<p>The iPhone 7 actually has the Apple A10 chip, which is (in theory) less powerful than Samsung&rsquo;s offering. At face value, this may mean that the S8 is faster and slicker than the iPhone 7 is. However, you should also take into consideration the fact that the software and optimisation of the devices tend to play a part in this too.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk a little about the features that each of these premium devices have on offer. Both are waterproof to a decent enough extent, with the iPhone coming in at a IP67 certificate and the Samsung with a IP68 certificate. They also both have a fairly progressive AI built into them &ndash; Apple obviously has Siri and Samsung has just released its competitor Bixby. However, that could be where the similarities end.</p>
<p>In truth, the S8 packs a whole load of things that the iPhone 7 just does not. It has an iris scanner, wireless charging, a headphone jack, and a microSD slot. All of these things are missing from the most recent generation of the iPhone. The S8 also packs double the RAM and storage of Apple&rsquo;s flagship device. So, when it comes to features and extras, you do get a fair bit more from Samsung.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one area in which you really cannot fault Apple, though. When it comes to connectivity and synchronicity (i.e. how well their devices work in sync), these guys really are ahead of the game. Should you have a Macbook or iPad as well as an iPhone, you will notice that all of the devices work seamlessly together. And, frankly, this is an area where Samsung lack a whole lot.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, there are pros and cons to each device and which you choose will depend on what you value from your phone. If you&rsquo;re looking for an advanced, high-tech offering with a hefty feel and a load of features to boot, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is sure to be a great device for you.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re used to the classic design and want a lightweight phone that syncs with all your other Apple products, the iPhone 7 is still a fantastic, high-end device with a whole load to offer.</p>
