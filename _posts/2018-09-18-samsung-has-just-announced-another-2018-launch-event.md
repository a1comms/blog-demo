<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It looks like Samsung has more in store for us in 2018!</span></p>
<p>This is a bit out of nowhere from Samsung. The tech giant usually have two main launch events in a year, and we&rsquo;ve already been treated to the&nbsp;Note 9 and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S9</a>. So, what are the rumours here and should we be expecting to see another Samsung mobile phone this year? Here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<h2>4x Fun Event</h2>
<p>It's a pretty suspect name, what do they mean by 4x? The <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-a-galaxy-event-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official invitation on the Samsung website</a>&nbsp;states the following;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samsung&rsquo;s newest Galaxy device is bringing more ways to express yourself than ever before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capture the fun with Samsung as the company celebrates the launch of the new device with A Galaxy Event on October 11, 2018.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>Say, what? Another Smartphone? According to reports from 9to5google, Samsung is preparing to launch a new mobile device with four main cameras!</p>
<p>Suggested by the name of this event, this couldn&rsquo;t be too far off from the truth. But, we are left asking ourselves questions: what other features would a phone like this have and would it be a world beater like the Galaxy S9?</p>
<p>For the answers to these questions, we will have to wait until the live event in a few weeks&rsquo; time.</p>
<h2>Fuel the Fire</h2>
<p>Samsung CEO, DJ Koh, was only recently quoted by&nbsp;9to5google talking about a foldable smartphone by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>With no real indication of what we&rsquo;re going to see here, DJ Koh gave a slight tease about Samsung&rsquo;s intentions stating on CNBC news, &ldquo;&hellip;it's time to deliver&hellip;" on a foldable device.</p>
<p>Check out this concept teaser of the rumoured Samsung foldable phone:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDalqo27CM" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Although Koh remained pretty tight-lipped when talking about the whole thing (as expected), he went on to mention the functionality of the rumoured device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can use most of the uses... on foldable status. But when you need to browse or see something, then you may need to unfold it. But even unfolded, what kind of benefit does that give compared to the tablet? If the unfolded experience is the same as the tablet, why would they (consumers) buy it?," Koh said at the IFA electronics show in Berlin.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this won&rsquo;t mean a retro looking flip phone, but a more futuristic looking device (something like out the movies please).</p>
<p>Only recently we delivered a report on the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-might-have-three-screens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foldable smartphone rumours from Samsung</a>, with Huawei also looking to get in on the action.</p>
<p>The real question now is, are we going to see a foldable smartphone combined with the quad camera setup? Only time will tell what the '4x' actually means.</p>
<p>Here's a concept of how the foldable Samsung phone could look.</p>
