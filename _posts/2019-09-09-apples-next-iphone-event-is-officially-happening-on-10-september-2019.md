<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s an overview of what to expect at Apple's next big iPhone event.</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again. If you&rsquo;re an Apple fan, it&rsquo;s the news you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, we now have confirmation that the highly awaited iPhone event will take place this week on Tuesday 10 September at the company&rsquo;s HQ in Cupertino, California. That means that you can go ahead and put the date in your diary right now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>What Can We Expect at the iPhone Event?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the people at Apple are tight-lipped about the announcements they have coming our way, there are plenty of rumours flying around. Many expect that there will be three new iPhones unveiled as part of the event. These could be next generation versions of the XR, XS, and XS Max.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, the fun and games don&rsquo;t stop there. Leaked <a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/exclusive-first-look-at-2019-iphone-xi-renders-45655.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renders</a> of the new iPhones suggest that they may have a triple camera setup. That could mean that we&rsquo;re about to see a brand-new series of iPhones with new and improved photography. Since a hefty camera setup is a growing trend among smartphones, it would make sense for Apple to do this.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another feature that we have yet to see on iPhones is bidirectional wireless charging, i.e. the ability to charge other Bluetooth gadgets using your smartphone. As other market leaders have already released devices with this feature, we may see Apple following suit.</p>

<h2>More Than Just iPhones</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the focus of the event will largely be on the iPhones, Apple is certain to have other treats in store for us too. The company tends to use the annual event to reveal a few new gadgets (from Apple Watches to iPads) along the way. That means that we could see some other announcements being made during the upcoming event next week.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, one intriguing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/17/apple-31-inch-6k-display-mini-led-kuo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumour</a> suggests that Apple will be releasing a brand new 16-inch Macbook Pro this September. The report suggests that the new laptop with have a 6K display and a Mini LED-like backlight design. It would certainly be exciting to see a new addition to the already-impressive line of Macbooks available on the market.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We may also have a new Apple Watch coming our way. A report from Brazilian company <a href="https://ihelpbr.com/apple-watch-2019-ceramica-titanio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iHelpBR</a> suggests that there will be a new titanium and ceramic-cased watch in the pipeline. Whether that will be ready this month remains to be seen. Of course, Apple has not confirmed anything at this time&hellip; so we can only speculate.</p>
