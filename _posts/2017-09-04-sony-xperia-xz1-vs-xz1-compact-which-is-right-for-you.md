<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We&rsquo;re here to help you decide which new Sony is perfect for you.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new phone, we have some rather exciting news for you. Sony has just announced two brand new devices &mdash; the Xperia XZ1 and the Xperia XZ1 Compact.</p>
<p>As you may imagine, these two smartphones follow suit with the Xperia design and style, while packing in a few handy extras! So, which one is right for you? Let&rsquo;s look at what each Sony phone has to offer and what you can expect should you choose it. Here&rsquo;s everything that we know so far.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>At first glance, these two phones look almost identical. Yes, the distinctive Sony Xperia look hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere just yet. Both the latest mobiles flaunt elegant simplicity &mdash; minimal fuss and absolutely no nonsense. When you look a little deeper here, though, there are some striking differences that set the phones apart.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14828" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JxQg79FASiLASySwPsHbdzEN9fDKfC-1zubIgI5mJVx3AopwOWMVkw0amrdPe5aOB34rKnBMDo1P_UD4mZv8hSxC=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>First of all, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is a tad smaller than the standard XZ1. That&rsquo;s to be expected, given its name. The XZ1 comes in at 148 x 73.4 x 7.4 mm, whereas the Compact version of the phone is just 129 x 64 x 9.3 mm. So, there <em>is</em> a noticeable difference between the two. You will see that the Compact is slightly thicker as well, since it has to pack more into smaller dimensions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14829" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pEg33aVlUWi2DMXgnnTOk7-GRc3xGDHX5aUYx90eZVHu07qV0T7j08ez_4KLACxuKHoJRNHhou7s0hZf5PnT8VypCQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to the finish, there&rsquo;s one surprising difference. The Xperia XZ1 is made entirely of metal, while the XZ1 Compact is made of polycarbonate, with a chic metal finish. Again, this is a minor distinction but it may well be enough to sway some people one way or another here.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get down to what really matters here &mdash;&nbsp;the display. The Compact version of the phone has a modest 4.6-inch screen and a 720p HD display, that&rsquo;s not HDR compliant. It&rsquo;s not about to blow you away anytime soon, but is probably enough for most users. And the smaller size makes it easier to use with just one hand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14830" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6VD8vHu99wPB2iPLp174hm4WbyI6FNRfK8BuGFg_p7NkNqbLe6rn0GvtKmiQcBifvH0F7q0faqLDDPfRLWAa6q5F=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Sony Xperia XZ1 packs a 5.2-inch screen with a 1080p panel to boot. That means that if you&rsquo;re hoping to get the best possible display for your money here, opting for the main flagship device could well be the way forward. It makes gaming and apps even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that both phones have Sony&rsquo;s Triluminos display (technology used in Sony&rsquo;s TVs), which is likely to boost their quality somewhat.</p>

<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Both devices pack the very latest chipset, a Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 835, that means you should be able to expect great things from each smartphone. Plus, the Xperia XZ1 and the XZ1 Compact each boast a respectable 4GB RAM. In theory, that means that you&rsquo;re getting a great performance regardless of which device you happen to choose.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14832" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RywuW4hiJzuTJNZQDsSN5x7zuOVHiSe42VASyF5NFXlfWKBmQVn2gYOvw9roIIZqx3_dPhQKgcfJGNeaJim1K696=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But wait just a minute here, what about battery size? Well, this is another area where these two Sony smartphones are identical. Sony has equipped each phone with a generous 2,700mAh battery.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that this power pack may well last longer in the Xperia XZ1 Compact, simply because the display is less demanding. It could be that the smaller Sony smartphone is the best for battery.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>What features can you expect from Sony Xperia XZ1 and the XZ1 Compact? If you&rsquo;re a snap-happy fiend, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that both have <em>almost</em> matching cameras. They come with a 19-megapixel rear lens and a 960 fps slo-mo video camera (check out the slo-mo awesomeness in the video below).</p>
<p>However, the selfie cam on the larger Xperia XZ1 comes in at 13MP, whereas the XZ1 Compact features a more modest 8MP camera.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>In terms of other features, both Sony smartphones are on a level pegging. The Xperia XZ1 and the XZ1 Compact each run <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/android-oreo-release-date-and-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android 8 Oreo</a>; that&rsquo;s Android&rsquo;s latest OS offering. Plus, both flaunt a high-res audio system, a fingerprint scanner, and IP65/68 waterproofing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, both devices are solid offerings from Sony, which makes choosing between them especially difficult. Prices are yet to be confirmed, but the Xperia XZ1 will cost more than the Compact, which may be a deciding factor.</p>

<p>Overall, though, Sony Xperia XZ1 has the more premium features, including a better selfie camera, a full-metal casing and a higher resolution screen. While these differences are by no means lifechanging, they could well be worth spending a little extra cash to bag.</p>
