<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It's all about the speed.</span></p>
<p>Ready for some exciting news? OnePlus, the Chinese megabrand, just made a rather massive announcement &ndash;&nbsp;the launch of its latest flagship phone. Say hello to the OnePlus 6T. If you missed the whirlwind event itself, don&rsquo;t panic. We&rsquo;ve got you covered. Here are eight things you need to know about the brand new device.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKZ7ObS-4QY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>1) It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Burdenless&rsquo; Phone</h2>
<p>Nobody thinks that technology should be a burden, right? At the launch, the OnePlus team explained that the phone would be &lsquo;clean, fast, and intuitive.&rsquo; Or, as they like to put it, &lsquo;burdenless.&rsquo; In short, the idea is that the phone is easy to use and does just what you expect it to do, when you want it to do it. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<h2>2) It has Screen Unlock</h2>
<p>While the previous incarnation of the OnePlus had facial recognition and a fingerprint sensor on the rear, the new OnePlus 6T switches things up. The device has Screen Unlock &ndash; a fingerprint sensor that&rsquo;s built into the screen. That means that, in order to open the phone, you simply put your chosen finger on the display. As a bonus, this will also be the &lsquo;fastest in-screen sensor in the world.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>3) The Display Is Impressive!</h2>
<p>Boasting a rather epic 6.41-inch display with 2340x1080 resolution, it&rsquo;s quite hard to fault the display on the OnePlus 6T. It packs 402 pixels per inch, which means that you get a seriously high quality picture. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;most immersive screen&rsquo; that the company has launched so far too and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6. Awesome stuff.</p>
<h2>4) It Will Take Awe-Inspiring Night Photos</h2>
<p>The camera on the OnePlus 6T certainly lives up to the hype. With a f/1.7 aperture, OIS+EIS stabilisation, and 480fps slow-mo video capabilities, it&rsquo;s plain to see that the company has gone all out here.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. Low-light photos is an area that&rsquo;s often neglected. However, this device offers the Nightscape mode feature, which was developed with the help of professional photographers.</p>

<h2>5) Plus, Some Dramatic Portrait Pictures</h2>
<p>When the OnePlus 6T camera detects a face, it takes the camera abilities to a whole new level. The Studio Lighting feature accentuates the lighting on facial features. That means that you can create a spotlight-esque picture of your friends and loved ones in mere seconds. You have to see the pictures for themselves to believe it!</p>
<h2>6) It Boasts the Latest Smartphone Technology</h2>
<p>But wait just a minute here, what&rsquo;s under the hood? Well, we&rsquo;re glad you asked! The OnePlus 6T actually runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 software. That should mean that it&rsquo;s uber fast and works like a dream. So, watch this space. With loads of RAM and storage too, you&rsquo;ll be truly in for a treat when it comes to performance.</p>
<h2>7) Plus, Full Screen Gesture 2.0</h2>
<p>Oh, and as though that wasn't enough, the operating system is called OxygenOS. It&rsquo;s based on the Android 9 system that many modern-day smartphones have and its own unique look and style. The developers have also fitted it with Full Screen Gesture 2.0, which mean that every tap and touch will be intuitive and help you control the device.</p>

<h2>8) Gamers Will Fall in Love With It</h2>
<p>Smartphone gaming is a massive deal these days. As the technology catapults forward so does the many ways in which you can use it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re something of a gamer, the chances are that you&rsquo;ll fall head over heels in love with this phone. The device offers &lsquo;Smart Boost,&rsquo; which allows your phone to use ROM instead of RAM while in game-play. That means that your phone can function faster and there will be fewer drops in performance. Nice.</p>
