<p><span class="postStandFirst">The latest new thing, 4G, is here for our mobile devices... But what is it and is it really that much faster? Well, you've come to the right place; enjoy our full, comprehensive 4G Network Guide.</span></p>
<p>In 2003, Three became the first network in the UK to offer 3G services. At the time, there was some confusion about what 3G actually was, but over time, the real meaning of 3G filtered into the public consciousness.</p>
<p>What it came down to was&nbsp;<em>data speed</em>&nbsp;and back then, 3G phones were a whole quantum leap over any other phones on the market. For the first time, the web became a real thing on phones, as opposed to the rough equivalent it had been&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>Now, ten years later, a new data standard is sweeping the country. It&rsquo;s as big a quantum leap over current phones as 3G was over&nbsp;<em>old</em>&nbsp;phones back then, and its name is LTE.</p>
<p>But what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;LTE, and how can it benefit you, the consumer?</p>
<p>LTE stands for Long-Term Evolution, but it&rsquo;s likely that it will always be known by its more famous name, 4G. As&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;name suggests, 4G is the next generation of mobile data connection, although the way it works is broadly similar to 3G and HSDPA (itself known as 3.5G; some people have described HSDPA as 3G with a supercharger on it, and before the advent of 4G, HSDPA was the data standard on top-end smartphones like the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3).</p>
<p>The big difference is that 4G is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;faster, faster even than many home broadband connections!</p>
<p>Naturally, this opens up a whole world of possibilities that weren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>previously</em>&nbsp;available to mobile phones. Imagine watching a full movie, in beautiful HD, on your commute home on the bus. Imagine a future where mobile gaming has an online multiplayer component that&rsquo;s as compelling as on a PC or console, made possible by a super-fast data connection without any lags. Imagine a smartphone that browses the web as fast as it does when connected to your home WiFi, when you&rsquo;re out and about.</p>
<p><em>That&nbsp;</em>is what makes 4G so exciting.</p>
<p>4G services are being rolled out round the country as we speak, and although access to the new data speed is limited to certain cities at the moment, when it becomes widespread, it will change the way we use smartphones forever.</p>
<p>So, if you want to get in early on this revolution, or if you want to future proof your phone (since LTE phones&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;quite capable of connecting to the net via 3G and HSDPA, as well), which phones should you be looking at? At present, the selection of networks who offer this new service is limited to EE, but EE does have a selection of incredible phones available, including 4G versions of the aforementioned Samsung Galaxy S3, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung">Samsung Galaxy Note II</a>. For those who prefer iOS, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple">iPhone 5</a>&nbsp;also supports 4G, as does the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/nokia/nokia-lumia-920">Nokia Lumia 920</a>, for people who prefer Windows phones.</p>
<p>For those who want something relentlessly new, powerful and incredible, there&rsquo;s also the&nbsp;<em>phenomenal</em>&nbsp;HTC One.</p>
<p><strong>More and more places are being covered by 4G coverage every day, so now is the perfect time to join the 4G revolution!</strong></p>
