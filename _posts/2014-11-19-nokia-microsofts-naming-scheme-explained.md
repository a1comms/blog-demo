<p><span class="postStandFirst">Have you ever wondered how Nokia, and now Microsoft, pick the names for their phones? Join us as we take a look at how the naming process works, and how it makes things easier for anyone who&rsquo;s looking to buy a new Windows smartphone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6040" alt="emulator-product-page-jpg" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/emulator-product-page-jpg.jpg" width="525" height="525" /></p>
<p>Back in the old days, Nokia always had a standard naming scheme for all their phones, with each one having a name made up of four numbers, and the bigger the number, the more advanced the phone (hence a Nokia 9210 was <i>way</i> more advanced than a Nokia 3210).</p>
<p>After that, the naming scheme changed, to include both letters and numbers; the Nseries became Nokia&rsquo;s top-end line-up, where you&rsquo;d find all their flagship phones, while the Eseries was made up of business devices, and the Cseries was comprised of their budget offerings. It seemed like the names had been locked in, and wouldn&rsquo;t be changing again.</p>
<p>And then Windows Phone came along, and Nokia launched a whole new product line: Lumia. Once again, the naming scheme changed, and it&rsquo;s this naming scheme that Microsoft (who bought Nokia) has kept going, even now, after they have started to drop the &ldquo;Nokia&rdquo; name from their phones.</p>
<h2>The Numbers Game</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6039" alt="Lumia-735-wireless-charging" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Lumia-735-wireless-charging.jpg" width="525" height="525" /></p>
<p>The <i>current</i> naming scheme has gone back to the way things used to be, with the phones&rsquo; names once again being made up of numbers; the first number in a phone&rsquo;s name is conceived as representing the relative price point (and thus, gives you an idea of how &ldquo;high-end&rdquo; it is). The other two numbers then act as a unique identifier of... well, of how <i>new</i> the phone is, since those last two numbers steadily increase with each new phone that gets released within its price range.</p>
<p>So, to put it in simple terms, a Nokia Lumia 925 is <i>newer</i> than a Nokia Lumia 920, and more advanced than an entry-level Nokia Lumia 635 (which is itself newer than a Lumia 620).</p>
<p>We like nice, logical naming schemes, and that one is about as logical as they come. It also has the added benefit of allowing prospective buyers to <i>directly</i> compare Lumia phones with each other (as in the example above), making it simpler than ever for people to find the right phone for them.</p>
<h2>The Ones That <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> Fit...</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6042" alt="hero-heart1x1-jpg" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/hero-heart1x1-jpg.jpg" width="525" height="525" /></p>
<p>There are a couple of phones that don&rsquo;t seem to be <i>quite</i> as logical in their naming as the rest, however, as in spite of having bigger numbers for names, they&rsquo;re not <i>necessarily</i> that much more advanced than Lumia phones in the 900-range. The first was the Nokia Lumia 1020 (pronounced &ldquo;ten-twenty&rdquo;), which got a unique number-range for its name because it includes a PureView camera (we&rsquo;ve spoken about it before, and in short, it&rsquo;s the best camera phone ever made).</p>
<p>The other one is the Nokia Lumia 1320, the first ever Windows Phone-powered phablet. We can say with absolute certainty that it&rsquo;s not 4 numbers more advanced than the Lumia 925 (although it <i>is</i> a really accomplished device), and in this case, it got the whopping big number for its product name because it has a whopping big <i>screen</i>.</p>
<p><strong>So, basically, Nokia and/or Microsoft&rsquo;s naming scheme is set in stone, except for the cases where it&rsquo;s, erm, not. Even with those two outliers (which have unique names, for unique reasons), the whole thing remains nice and logical, and we can&rsquo;t help but applaud the idea of making things easier for customers.</strong><b> </b></p>
