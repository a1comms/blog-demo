<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The battle of the big screens!</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tale as old as time. I&rsquo;m not talking about Beauty and the Beast here. No, I mean Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>These two mega-brands have been hashing it out for years now and, with every new smartphone that hits stores, a new battle ensues. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a larger smartphone, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Let&rsquo;s take a look at iPhone Xs Max and Galaxy Note 9 in more detail.</p>
<h2>iPhone Xs Max vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Design</h2>
<p>The iPhone Xs Max is a seriously big device. The phablet has all the futuristic style that we&rsquo;ve previously seen on the iPhone X model but slots it into a much larger package.</p>
<p>Combining premium-quality glass and a stainless steel band, the device is one of the most luxurious on the market right now. Plus, it comes in Space Grey, Silver and a new Gold tone that people are certain to fall in love with. When you consider the almost bezeless (all-screen) display too (aside from a small notch), it&rsquo;s a real thing of beauty.</p>
<p>Then again, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 also has that high-end feel. With rear glass panels, an epic screen and an aluminium frame, it&rsquo;s hard to find fault with this device. Plus, it also has the S-pen, which sets it aside from other players out there (more on that later on). Plus, it&rsquo;s super colourful too. It actually comes in Blue, Black, and Purple.</p>

<h2>iPhone Xs Max vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Display</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk displays. iPhone Xs Max sports a huge 6.5-inch Super Retina AMOLED display with a 1242 x 2688 resolution. It&rsquo;s pretty darn impressive. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 comes in a little smaller with an 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display. However, it has a higher resolution at 1440 x 2960. Both of the devices are remarkable when it comes to the display, so whether it&rsquo;s Netflix or YouTube, you should find that either will fit the bill for you.</p>
<h2>iPhone Xs Max vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Cameras</h2>
<p>With a dual-lens offering on the rear, iPhone Xs Max has a pretty swanky camera. You&rsquo;ve got a 12-megapixel telephoto lens along with a 12-megapixel sensor on the back. Then there&rsquo;s the 7-megapixel &lsquo;selfie&rsquo; camera on the front as well. Plus, Apple has unleashed smart HDR photography which is meant to capture more detail than ever before. There&rsquo;s also Portrait Mode, which has already proved to be a hit on previous iPhone incarnations.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has quite a similar setup. There is a dual 12-megapixel camera on the back of the device along with an 8-megapixel &lsquo;selfie&rsquo; cam on the front. However, when it comes to the software and features, we&rsquo;re looking at quite a different offering. The new AI photography means that the phone should be able to detect problems with any given photo and offer advice to help you to take the crispest, most Instagram-worthy pictures.</p>

<h2>iPhone Xs Max vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Performance and Battery</h2>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s under the hood of these two flagship masterpieces? Well, the iPhone Xs Max has Apple&rsquo;s own A12 Bionic chip. It&rsquo;s supposedly the &lsquo;smartest and most powerful chip&rsquo; the smartphone world has ever seen. Needless to say, the device is certain to be nifty and fast. When it comes to the battery, you&rsquo;ve got a 3174 mAh offering, which means that the phone should have no problem going all-day-long.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has Exynos 981, which is not quite as impressive or advanced as Apple&rsquo;s chip. However, it is still more than what the average user would need as there&rsquo;s loads of RAM on offer too. The battery outshines Apple, as the Samsung has a whopping 4000 mAh unit here. That type of power means that the device will last a whole day and probably longer, depending on what you use your phone for.</p>

<h2>iPhone Xs Max vs. Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Extra Features</h2>
<p>When it comes to extra features, iPhone Xs Max has a similar offering to the previous iPhone X model. You have FaceID, a fingerprint scanner, and new AR gaming features.</p>
<p>Siri has also seen some major improvements and should be more intuitive than ever. There are also the tried and tested Apple extras, such as Animoji, that users are sure to love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great news for gamers here! Samsung have gone into a partnership with Epic Games, which means that there is now an exclusive <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/is-galaxy-note-9-the-best-phone-for-playing-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android version of Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest improvements when it comes to features, though, have to do with the S-pen. The stylus is no longer a mere stylus, but a mini remote control. Users can control things like slideshows, music, and selfies with just the click of the device.</p>
