<p><span class="postStandFirst">With Brazil 2014 overshadowing the sporting world, some might not be aware that Wimbledon, our beautifully British tennis tournament, does in fact start <i>today</i>.</span></p>
<p>With Roy Hodgson&rsquo;s pride of lions (clowder of pussy cats, more like) already eliminated from the World Cup, the nation&rsquo;s hope rests upon the shoulders of two-time Grand Slam champion and current holder of the Wimbledon Championships, Mr. Andrew Murray.</p>
<p>But, the tournament&rsquo;s only just begun, so let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves too soon. We&rsquo;ve put together five top tennis apps to help you immerse yourself in the Wimbledon fever, and quickly forget about the crippling defeat in Brazil&hellip; wait, what defeat?</p>
<h2>1) Racquet Tune</h2>
<p>This app has certainly been created for the most prudent and meticulous tennis players on the court. Using the sound generated by tapping racquet strings, Racquet Tune is able to calculate their tension with surprisingly good accuracy. This app even produces sound wave graphics to help you find the best way of tapping the strings.</p>
<p>The Stringweight calculator will work out how your racquet&rsquo;s balance, sweet spot location and string weight can be affected. You can also simulate various racquet and string configurations with the app&rsquo;s Stiffness calculator.</p>
<p>Tennis isn&rsquo;t for every racquet player, but this app is. You can customise it to calculate the optimum tension for squash, racquetball and badminton racquets respectively.</p>
<p>So, stop trying to tune your guitar to absolute perfection - we&rsquo;ve heard enough ear-bleeding renditions of &lsquo;Wonderwall&rsquo; &ndash; and start tuning that dusty tennis racquet until it&rsquo;s ready to take on the world&rsquo;s greatest players.</p>
<p>Racquet Tune is available to download from the App Store (&pound;1.99) and Google Play (&pound;1.40).</p>

<h2>2) Tennis TV</h2>
<p>This is the Official live video streaming app of the ATP World Tour and WTA, which allows users to stream up to 100 tournaments a year (or roughly 2000 matches!) to their smartphone or tablet in HD. If you have the appropriate cables or wireless link ups, you could of course stream whatever tennis game you&rsquo;re watching through to your TV too.</p>
<p>In addition to copious amounts of live matches, Tennis TV offers highlights, interviews and other top features. If you miss a particularly tantalising bout between Murray and Djokovic, match replays are available for seven days.</p>
<p>When multiple matches are being played simultaneously, and you&rsquo;d ideally like to keep on top of them all, you can split the screen on your iPad and watch four games at once. Don&rsquo;t give yourself a neck ache though, trying to follow so many tennis balls.</p>
<p>Tennis TV is available to download from the App Store and Google Play. One day&rsquo;s usage costs &pound;6.99, for one month it&rsquo;s &pound;14.99, and a years&rsquo; subscription will cost &pound;85.95.</p>

<h2>3) Padel Tennis Pro</h2>
<p>Padel Tennis Pro claims to feature the most realistic tennis physics on a smartphone. Whilst this is certainly a bold statement, you can&rsquo;t argue with the attention to detail when it comes to slice, spin and smashing. Just like the real thing, this game is pretty challenging for newbies.</p>
<p>Customise and upgrade your character&rsquo;s equipment, and incrementally build your speed, skill and power level to help dominate your opponents, and use your character&rsquo;s special powers and volleying skills to open up a torrent of different shots.</p>
<p>When you feel like you&rsquo;ve mastered the game and overcome &lsquo;the computer&rsquo;, you can claim bragging rights over your friends by crushing them in a head-to-head match over the net. Oh, and it has a pretty cool soundtrack too.</p>
<p>Padel Tennis Pro is available to download from the App Store (&pound;1.49).</p>

<h2>4) Coach&rsquo;s Eye</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty difficult to judge your own form in the split second it takes to strike a tennis ball, however, thanks to Coach&rsquo;s Eye - a performance-enhancing video app - you can analyse and scrutinise your every move, all in HD.</p>
<p>You can pick up on minute details by playing your footage back in slow motion, and zooming in on specific areas. You can also compare two videos side-by-side to see how different techniques are affecting your game. Fantasize that you&rsquo;re Gary Neville giving half-time punditry, by drawing and annotating on videos to analyse them effectively.</p>
<p>Coach&rsquo;s Eye will let you import existing videos from your phone, so you can pick apart everything you have on your forehand. Users can share videos via email, text message, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other supporting apps, as well as the online Coach&rsquo;s Eye community.</p>
<p>Of course, the features on this app can be used to analyse any sport &ndash; it&rsquo;s certainly not exclusive to tennis.</p>
<p>Coach&rsquo;s Eye is available to download from the App Store (&pound;2.99), Google Play (free) and the Windows Store (&pound;5.99)</p>

<h2>5) Stick Tennis</h2>
<p>Fun, interactive and simple to get going, Stick Tennis is one of the most addictive tennis apps out there. There are hoards of unique player styles and characteristics to earn and play with, as well as 70 real players and 10 different tennis courts to unlock.</p>
<p>In keeping with Stick Sports&rsquo; tradition, the graphics and player designs are pretty cute. So much so, that your grandmother would love nothing more than to get her pincers on Stick Federer&rsquo;s little rosy cheeks.</p>
<p>WORLD DOMINATION allows you to take on the all-time greats. Trophies and bonus balls are up for grabs in DAILY CHALLENGE. Take on your bumptious buddies in FRIENDS CHALLENGE.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call &lsquo;game, set and match&rsquo; too soon &ndash; there are loads of in-app purchases guaranteed to keep the fun going.</p>
<p><strong>Stick Tennis is available to download from the App Store and Google Play</strong></p>
