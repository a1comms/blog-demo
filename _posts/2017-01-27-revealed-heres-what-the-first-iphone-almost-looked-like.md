<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">iPhone&nbsp;could have been <em>so, so </em>different&hellip;</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd to think that it&rsquo;s been ten years since the first iPhone model was revealed. In that time, we&rsquo;ve got used to the trademark style of the devices. There&rsquo;s something so very distinctive about the design and interface of the phone that few of us could imagine being anything different.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise, though, that Apple tested more than one iPhone before launching with the original model we all knew and loved. The truth of the matter, is that the first iPhone could have been oh-so-different; it almost had a scroll wheel.</p>
<p>Yes, thanks to a YouTube video uploaded by the likes of Sonny Dickson, we finally get to see what other designs Apple were considering before their 2007 launch date. During this period, the tech giants were testing two similar models, named the P1 and P2.</p>

<p>While P2 was ultimately the model that the geniuses decided to go with, when you look at the other option, you get a glimpse of what might have been. You see, the P1 model used a wheel scroll function, much like the ones that were included on &lsquo;classic&rsquo; iPods. The only difference was that the scrolling function was part of the touchscreen interface. Nice.</p>
<p>Of course, in this battle of the iPhones, there could be only one winner. The team took the P2 forward and developed it to create the original iPhone. After the above video was released, Tony Fadell, the senior vice president of the iPod division at Apple from 2006 to 2008, tweeted that this was the right decision at the time.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Exactly! No doubt in anyone's mind which was the right path. Those on the iPod based UI knew is was doomed. SJ pushed us, "Make it work!" https://t.co/LHq6jQaAew</p>

<p>Back in late 2006, there were many rumours that the yet-to-be-released iPhone would have the scroll function. Many expected that the device would look something like an old-style iPod and support many of the same functions. However, when the phone hit stores, it was clear that the Apple developers had gone another way. Long story short, the modular iPhone we know today was born.</p>
