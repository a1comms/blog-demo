<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You&rsquo;ll have some fun with number 12!</span></p>
<p>Like it or lump it, Facebook is a huge part of all of our lives. Most of us use it for just about everything from tagging our friends in dank memes, to finding out about local events.</p>
<p>But, much like the brain, apparently, most of us aren&rsquo;t using Facebook to its full capacity. In fact, there are loads of Facebook hacks, secrets, and tips and tricks that you probably don&rsquo;t know about!</p>
<p>To raise your Facebook game from casual user to full-on Zuckerberg-like zeal, check out our 15 secret Facebook tips and tricks.</p>
<h2>1) Logout of Facebook Remotely</h2>
<p>We all know the feeling. You&rsquo;ve been using a public computer in a shared office, an internet cafe or perhaps the library. Naturally, the first thing you did after firing up the computer was log into Facebook to check in on the world. Then, on the way home, sheer panic hits you. Your face turns a burning shade of crimson&hellip; You forgot to logout of Facebook.</p>
<p>Luckily, you don&rsquo;t have to sprint back from whence you came. Oh no, you can <em>actually </em>logout of Facebook remotely in just a few seconds! Phew&hellip;</p>
<p>Head to the web interface of the site and just tape <strong>Settings > Security > Where you&rsquo;re logged in</strong>. You can then see any devices that you&rsquo;re still logged into, and of course log out of in just one little tap.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13505" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hqfZqM1drrVYOxDn7guRFSSDdeN2yJSWuZr0HscnG0uz-KLhvdlpxZDtW6KXFBVrqk3c_Aj-X7JtMcPhPQuBw2koXg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>2) Master Emoji Shortcuts</h2>
<p>If you have a favourite emoji (oh, hello little smiley poop!), you&rsquo;ll love this next Facebook trick. Rather than spending ages looking for just the right picture to sum up your feelings, you should try using a text shortcut to get to the emoji you want.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best Facebook shortcuts that you really need to know;</p>
<ul>
<li>Poop = <strong>:poop:</strong></li>
<li>Shark = <strong>(^^^)</strong></li>
<li>Not Bad = <strong>[[notbaad]]</strong></li>
<li>Penguin = <strong><(")</strong></li>
<li>Robot =<strong> :|]</strong></li>
<li>Rox = <strong>[[roxsign]]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, if there&rsquo;s an emoji that you just can&rsquo;t get enough of, it&rsquo;s well worth looking up what the shortcut is so that you never have to waste time finding it again.</p>
<h2>3) Get Rid of Someone Without Unfriending</h2>
<p>Unfriending people can be messy business. Sure, you may hate seeing the endless slideshow of some old friend&rsquo;s kid, cat, dog or whatever, but do you really want to cause the ultimate offence by deleting them for good? Probably not.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13461" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9hktt9jnVFpeyFBqtaQbzypkIY44fnebgKzW0wcQEno9eoJ_Pd3xJ73JGkCJ6_DIit6ZoK7GfbqIustJ47-Zavo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>To get around this modern-day dilemma, there&rsquo;s a rather simple solution. You see, one of Facebook&rsquo;s greatest secret features is the fact that you can unfollow someone without deleting them as a friend.</p>
<p>Just go to the offending friend&rsquo;s profile page, and you&rsquo;ll see a box that states &lsquo;Following&rsquo;. Click on it and hit the &lsquo;Unfollow&rsquo; button. After that, you won&rsquo;t get any updates from that particular person on your timeline, but you will remain &lsquo;friends.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>4) Find Facebook&rsquo;s Secret Inbox</h2>
<p>Few people actually know about Facebook&rsquo;s secret inbox (it wouldn&rsquo;t be a very good secret if they did!), but it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to access. Basically, when someone who isn&rsquo;t your friend sends you a message, it goes into an alternate inbox so as not to bother you.</p>
<p>To find Facebook&rsquo;s secret inbox, just go to <strong>Settings > People > Message Requests > See Filtered Requests</strong>. There you&rsquo;ll see messages from anyone and everyone who has tried to contact you over the years. Honestly, this is one of Facebook&rsquo;s best secret features&hellip; especially if you like reading random messages from strangers. Fun!</p>

<h2>5) You Can Still Poke People&hellip; Here&rsquo;s How</h2>
<p>Do you remember the good old days of Facebook, when you didn&rsquo;t have to message someone to get their attention? You could merely give them a cheeky Poke instead. It was a simpler time, and one many of us long for&hellip; even now.</p>
<p>Fortunately, those days aren&rsquo;t actually over yet. This Facebook tip will show tell you how to Poke your pal like it&rsquo;s 2007 all over again.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13466" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/abaW0LtYFhtlSZpmQLbreA5vcfWETwyCDXdp0b1uJevJGehvXOf9l8YhsKljpGr9MhaVdr8CQIFa-fNXS9PeLjHAaA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>To Poke a friend on Facebook, go to their profile page and look for a box to the right of the messages tab. You should see an ellipsis (<strong>..</strong>.); click the box to reveal a drop-down box list that includes the age-old Poke. Just remember to use it with caution.</p>
<h2>6) Shoot Some Hoops in Messenger</h2>
<p>When conversation dries up in Messenger, there&rsquo;s only one thing you ought to be doing. And that&rsquo;s to do with the sportiest secret Facebook feature, which lets you play games of basketball with your pal.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13467" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JxnTIw6FDEI-QHD4p71fOA_eZ-RaJ2Jd7FBOvp_M9ozrEklPaxojXZw4BkD3S9gQN8_8CL9VeBsKiAr95xUwp50j=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of this one yet, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat. All you need to do is send your friend a basketball emoji in the Messenger app. Once sent, click and hold the emoji for a second or two, and you&rsquo;ll unlock a hidden game of basketball that&rsquo;s as addictive as it is fun. Touchdown!</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>

<h2>7) Clean Up Your Cluttered Timeline</h2>
<p>When you open up Facebook and see the same old nonsense from the same old people, it can be a little frustrating. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could <em>choose </em>who you see more posts from rather than relying on Facebook to do it for you? Um, well, you can actually.</p>
<p>Just go through your &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; and label them as either &lsquo;Close Friends&rsquo; or &lsquo;Acquaintances&rsquo;. You can do this by accessing your friends list and hitting the drop down box next to each person&rsquo;s name. There, you can click either &lsquo;Close Friends&rsquo; or indeed &lsquo;Acquaintances&rsquo; to label them up for life!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13470" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y7wV-Gzs9O5IZo5cMen3s7DXQKbLPVh4OJgESLYa4asOL2pQH1wRtpEeHl0nIHB8kN5OHNIDqAdAKOo5b75gAixr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, more posts from the people you care about will appear on your Timeline, and fewer from people you consider mere acquaintances.</p>
<h2>8) Update Your Facebook Status by Text</h2>
<p>In an emergency situation when you just have to share a photo of your hotdog legs with the world, but you don&rsquo;t have 4G, sending a text to update your Facebook status could be the answer.</p>
<p>Luckily, with this Facebook trick, you can do just that. Text "F" to 32665 to set up this secret Facebook feature. After you&rsquo;ve done so, you can text whatever you want to that same number and Facebook will publish it as your status. Genius!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13472" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hVxodXLztaUGl_2YzXaStVuVqPa2z5p1uL6-ZbVoig0Ds-jOsv6a8MX6g4Wg2eFlJjHcLXSkZJ51_lsy_Bkd2yE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>9) See Everything You Ever Posted on Facebook</h2>
<p>Make no mistakes, we post a whole load of stuff on Facebook, from videos to photos. If you want a copy of everything you&rsquo;ve ever posted online (because why on earth not?!), there&rsquo;s an easy Facebook trick you should try.</p>
<p>Head to <strong>Settings > Download a copy of your Facebook data </strong>to get everything you&rsquo;ve submitted to the platform. Before you do this, you should know that it may well be a large download. Think about it. The entire history of your selfies; that&rsquo;s a whole load of media to download at once.</p>

<h2>10) Find Out Who&rsquo;s Been Snooping on Your Facebook</h2>
<p>Are you stressed out about potential hackers logging into your account? Well, of course, you are! You don&rsquo;t want some stranger going through all your messages and Liking people&rsquo;s pictures. It&rsquo;s downright creepy.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the best secret features we know about allows you to see when and where someone has logged into your Facebook. Just got to <strong>Settings > Security </strong>and choose to get Login Alerts to your email address.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13475" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3X8XcsuAqawb5iEs7wcBMau_th7g8m94qZOfkX8DpmJUakd4kBU-dTK0yAew_xjc5jxkAFjfJThv7rODw3F-rZQ=s0" width="600" height="259" /></p>
<h2>11) Stop the Constant Birthday Notifications</h2>
<p>Pfft&hellip; Saying &lsquo;Happy birthday&rsquo; to someone you barely know on Facebook is just soooo 2010, am I right? Still, the good people at Facebook seem to be rather pushy about us acknowledging our friends&rsquo; and family members&rsquo; special days.</p>
<p>If you are so over getting notifications when it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s birthday, this Facebook hack will be right up your street. Head right to <strong>Settings > Notifications > Mobile </strong>in your app. There, you&rsquo;ll find that you can get rid of those annoying updates. Finally!</p>
<h2>12) Perfect the Art of Pirate</h2>
<p>Of course, you probably already know that you can change the language on your Facebook account. It&rsquo;s as easy as pie. Just go to<strong> Settings > Language </strong>and you will see a whole bunch of options available.</p>
<p>For the most part, these options are pretty standard; you&rsquo;ve got Spanish, French, English US, and so on. One thing that you might not realise, though, is that you can actually change the language to Pirate. Well, shiver me timbers!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13473" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dAZiffZC0eQjV-g3sE9cMUh0rSxgH_UQOzQi5_FTSKgFpt215KdP5T95K4rCq2wwhSpPU25Mlf2Thhm9DF4zGQs=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Simply select Pirate and watch your entire account change from boring old English UK to Jack Sparrow-esque lingo. Oh, and if that&rsquo;s not enough for you, there are also Upside Down English or Ye Olde Facebook language options.</p>

<h2>13) Turn Off Auto-Play Videos</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re idly scrolling down your newsfeed, there&rsquo;s nothing more irritating than coming across an &lsquo;auto-play&rsquo; video. How rude of Facebook to just assume that you want to watch it?</p>
<p>To turn off Facebook video auto-play, go to <strong>Settings > Videos > Auto-Play</strong>. You can toggle the feature off finally get a bit of choice on your Facebook Timeline.</p>
<h2>14) Take Control of All Your Social Media</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of having to update a load of different accounts when something exciting happens, this secret feature is the one for you.</p>
<p>Sadly, you can&rsquo;t link your Twitter and Instagram accounts through the Facebook app. However, if you go to each of these social media sites, there is an option where what you post on them will also be displayed on your Facebook. Do it. You know it makes sense.</p>
<h2>15) Choose Your Facebook Inheritor, Should You Pass</h2>
<p>Okay, this last one is a tad morbid, but it&rsquo;s something we should all think about in the technological age&hellip;</p>
<p>Facebook has become such a massive part of all our lives that choosing someone to take over it when you die is almost as important as making a will. You will want to choose someone trustworthy who can close down the page for you; perhaps a family member or your partner.</p>
<p>Just go to Security and nominate a 'Legacy Contact&rsquo;. They will get access to your Facebook account should the worst happen.</p>
