<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Budget phones just got way more exciting!</span></p>
<p>When you think of Samsung phones, you likely picture swish, top-of-the-range handsets, such as the swanky Galaxy S8.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that the tech giant has some rather impressive flagship devices, this is a company that caters to all tastes and budgets.</p>
<p>Case in point, Samsung has announced two new J-Series budget phones that you may just adore! Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy J3 and J5 (2017).</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Key Features</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the biggest selling points of the 2017 edition Galaxy J3 is the camera. Impressively, the device will packs a 13-megapixel shooter on the back, with built-in autofocus. That means you&rsquo;ll be able to take some snazzy photos once you&rsquo;ve bagged this budget phone. In addition, Galaxy J3 (2017) will also feature 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Key Features</h2>
<p>What about the more premium Galaxy J5 (2017)? Well, it just so happens that it comes with all of the above features, plus a Full HD Super AMOLED display to enhance your viewing experience. What&rsquo;s more, this Samsung mid-ranger is said to boast a 1.6GHz processor for fast performance and microSD card slot with support up to 256GB.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14082" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EuTCzij5uiE3NwqEtgeJj4yKubzW4MBkWO7fGtzqbYMPPY5nhnfp-L-QeeZWUUuRS1z76PnGhqTpSi06IpPc5IA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Needless to say, Samsung is pretty proud of these two devices. Conor Pierce, VP of Samsung&rsquo;s Mobile Division for the UK said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re confident that the new Galaxy J series&rsquo; enhanced design, superb camera technology and high-performance features will continue to appeal to existing and new customers seeking a beautifully designed, powerful smartphone from a premium brand, all at an affordable price point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s no official word on how much the Samsung Galaxy J3 and J5 will cost. It&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind, though, that these are by no means flagship devices and the price tag will reflect that.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy J5 and J3 (2017) Release Date</h2>
<p>If you fancy nabbing yourself a budget Samsung smartphone, you won&rsquo;t have to wait too long to get your hands on one! In fact, both the Galaxy J3 and J5 are set to launch this July. It&rsquo;s well worth looking at deals ahead of time so you can make sure that you get the phone the very moment it hits stores across the UK!</p>
