<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung and Apple go head-to-head once again!</span></p>
<p>Last week, the South Korean mega-brand announced the latest addition to its lineup &ndash;&nbsp;Galaxy Note 9. The new phone sounds pretty darn impressive, but how does it measure up to iPhone X? Let&rsquo;s take a look and try to figure out which phone is right for you.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>At first glance, choosing which device looks more attractive would be a difficult feat. There&rsquo;s no denying the fact that these two phones both have a high-end (if quite different) finish! They&rsquo;re both covered in glass and offer a premium look. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has slightly larger bezels at the top and bottom of the screen than iPhone X.</p>
<p>When it comes to weight and size, there&rsquo;s a noticeable difference between the two phones. The Galaxy Note 9 weighs in at 201g while iPhone X is just 174g. Since the Note device is marketed as a larger device for productivity, though, the fact that it&rsquo;s a little bigger than a standard flagship should come as no real surprise.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the screen. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has a clear advantage here. The display comes in at 6.4-inches, the largest we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a Note device before now. iPhone X has a slightly smaller offering, at 5.8 inches (but, again, you have to remember that it&rsquo;s neither a phablet nor a Plus model).</p>
<p>The iPhone has a 2436x1125 resolution display whereas the Samsung has a slightly sharper 2960x1440 setup. There&rsquo;s the famous notch on top of the iPhone X screen which some love and others hate. Then again, as we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, the Samsung has a significantly larger screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18212" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8sMuty7rWwV2m5NQ_da7fm0gQX8B7F4rxwnFvXd2UdDwhnCsskUnC-1YVcxO6qD4AK1HGfrkM5QTJ2E1_YJBK4o8EA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Note 9 is packed with productivity features. Bixby, Samsung&rsquo;s signature AI, has been made smarter than ever. The assistant now remembers conversations, which means that you can ask it a series of questions about the same topic or search enquiry. There have also been upgrades to the DeX setup (Samsung&rsquo;s phone to desktop/screen share capability); you only need an HDMI cable to connect to a screen and can use your phone and the desktop setup at the same time.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, there&rsquo;s the S Pen. It&rsquo;s been upgraded in some serious ways. You can now use it as a remote control for your device. That means that you can take selfies with it, pause things on your phone and even control your music. Of course, it also works as a stylus as well.</p>

<p>iPhone X has a very different lineup of features. There&rsquo;s the Face ID, which allows you to unlock your phone using your face and unlock other features too, such as payments. There&rsquo;s also the Animoji, which is a whole load of fun, if a little novel. There are 12 characters from which to choose including a panda, cat, and robot.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough to tickle your fancy, iPhone X boasts crazy AR capabilities, making gaming and some apps better than ever. Right now, it&rsquo;s up to developers to use this new element of the iPhone and create things that will take advantage of the AR.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>When iPhone X first came out, it was all about the True Depth camera &ndash; it&rsquo;s an impressive setup and the very thing that has enabled Face ID. The rear camera has a nice 12-megapixel lens along with another 12-megapixel wide lens too, whereas the front camera has a 7-megapixel TrueDepth camera lens. Of course, that&rsquo;s not all. The camera also had a new colour filter, fast sensors and smart capabilities. All of the above means that it&rsquo;s a pretty awesome experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14961" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ip6mmqgMO8Myp_hKrgtN7z75QLBWDj9W6ck4EDLh5TpLQ-Vdi0uSMRAouHoilLB2tXNsuSjBo3bzUGd66KdMZY_Cqg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, what does the Galaxy Note 9 have to offer? Well, the rear setup is pretty similar. There&rsquo;s a dual 12-megapixel wide camera and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera. The front-facing selfie camera has an 8-megapixel offering too. The Samsung has a whole load of camera features and extras too &ndash; when you get a chance to explore them. And, let&rsquo;s not forget, that you can take selfies with the S Pen as well, which is a real bonus.</p>
<h2>Power and Storage</h2>
<p>When it comes to battery power, the Galaxy Note 9 is certainly setting the standard. The new &lsquo;all day&rsquo; battery comes in at 4000 mAh which is better than we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a Galaxy Note series phone. Of course, it truly overshadows the iPhone X battery, which is a 2716 mAh offering. Of course, you should remember that the phone is much smaller, which means that it can afford to have a slightly less powerful battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14962" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hwRLf6VtBxywl5OV980JsHUJngzlK6MbnQiG9HfyvyrW5De36ttB7o7Da59a63xAjWd3kV2UQtTMMwziojEYdQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Storage-wise, the Galaxy Note 9 will have 128GB or 512GB versions available while iPhone X has 64GB or 256GB (which, let's face it, is still pretty sizeable). Plus, you can add extra storage to the Samsung with a microSD card, which means that it could end up being massive. iPhone X sports the A11 Bionic chipset, a leader in the market, while the Samsung has a Snapdragon 845 setup. Both however, are great for mobile gaming.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Both iPhone X and the Galaxy Note 9 are two of the most lusted after devices right now. So, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that both device prices reflect that. iPhone X starts at &pound;999 (but, of course, you can get deals and finance offers online), with the Samsung starting at &pound;899 &ndash; &pound;100 cheaper than the iPhone.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pitting the iPhone and Samsung against one another may seem like an obvious comparison. The two phones are market leaders. However, they serve two different purposes. iPhone X is a standard (if, very impressive!) flagship device. It&rsquo;s your everyday smartphone, offering a load of snazzy features and highlights.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a different breed. It&rsquo;s a phone that has been designed with productivity in mind. Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty darn big. Which you choose comes down to what you want. If you&rsquo;re after a large phone with a stylus and creative potential, opt for the Galaxy Note 9. If you&rsquo;d prefer a neat smartphone with cool security features, the iPhone is for you. As always, the choice is 100% yours.</p>
