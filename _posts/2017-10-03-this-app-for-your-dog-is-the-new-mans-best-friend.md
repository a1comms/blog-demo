<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This dog app is all just a walk in the park, but how much is that doggy in the app store?</span></p>
<p>PitPat, a techy pet start-up, has created a pet tracker and smartphone app that monitors your dog&rsquo;s activity and calorie count, all in the name of having a healthy pet. It&rsquo;s like having a free doggy health check in your pocket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15106" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WePOj1CbGpKykVKAr3m9aY2l-Ml26T7NWEKzcoQXOeeKpH5Zhm-dKWusGkf2ZM2eYGWHAF1fWZgYnlyfipLD2kkW=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Neat idea, right. I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t want to know if their dog is getting enough exercise? After all, it contributes to the owner&rsquo;s overall health too as you strut your stuff down the local park.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15105" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S3hpaQAcO8eQ7be8gjFbn1BvlpzTawLv66AJWHFZmXHOCgVQ3rQNOXrQfYZryZW7PK_Taq6EMJBdFoO74rz2p71-RQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, how does it work. The PitPat activity tracker attaches to your dog&rsquo;s collar and tracks movements from here. When synced to your mobile phone via Bluetooth, you get a detailed and insightful view of your dog&rsquo;s activity!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQSPblPnssg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The tracker will record info based on your dog&rsquo;s breed, age and measured activity. This is the best way for the tech to suggest the amount of exercise your dog needs to be doing. <em>Who&rsquo;s a clever app then.</em></p>

<p>The tech is designed to work on an array of iOS and Android devices, from iPhone 4s and upwards, as well as&nbsp;a whole load of Android phones, with fan favourites such as Samsung, HTC and BlackBerry.</p>
<p>So, if your dog has health problems, needs to lose a bit of extra timber or has been given a regime of exercise after having too many treats, this app and monitor could certainly assist owners on their way to achieving this.</p>
