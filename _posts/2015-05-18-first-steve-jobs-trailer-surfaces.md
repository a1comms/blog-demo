<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new biopic of Steve Jobs is on the way, aptly called&nbsp;<em>Steve Jobs</em>, and the first trailer for it has now appeared online. Directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Michael Fassbender, the film will take a long, hard look at the man behind the mythos...</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-6780 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/gallery_place-1024x511.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/gallery_place.jpg alt=&rdquo;Keywords&rdquo; />" width="960" height="479" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes said that the iPhone (of which&nbsp;iPhone 6 is the latest, greatest incarnation) is the most influential phone in history, and if that&rsquo;s the case, then it must logically follow that the late Steve Jobs was one of the most influential people to work in the mobile industry.</p>
<p>A new biopic by British director Danny Boyle (director of <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, <em>28 Days Later</em>, etc), the first trailer for which has now appeared on Youtube&nbsp;(watch&nbsp;below), aims to take a look at the man <em>behind</em> the mythos.</p>
<p>Starring Michael Fassbender, the film will take the somewhat unusual approach of having only three scenes, each one taking place just before a key product launch; it&rsquo;s not clear which product launches the film will centre around, but it seems a fair bet that the final one will centre around Jobs&rsquo; final launch before he passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the trailer hints at a movie which does <em>not</em> sink into hero worship, and which also doesn&rsquo;t hold back from acknowledging Jobs&rsquo; darker side; Jobs has long been acknowledged as a deeply polarising person, and it appears that the script for the film, written by <em>The Social Network</em>&rsquo;s Aaron Sorkin, will deal with that side of the man&rsquo;s character head-on.</p>
<p>It comes after 2013 biopic of Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher, was panned by critics and flopped at the box office.</p>
<p><strong><em>Steve Jobs</em>&nbsp;is due for release on October 9th in the USA, and will hit UK cinemas on November 13th.</strong></p>
