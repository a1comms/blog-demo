<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Sony Xperia M2 has a lot to live up to, given its sibling relationship with the utterly fantastic Sony Xperia Z2 and Xperia Z3. We take a look at how well it manages to live up to that legacy, and at whether this is the perfect choice for people who want their first big-screen phone.</span></p>
<p>Given the amount of money, time and general hype that&rsquo;s invested in flagship smartphones like the&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z3&nbsp;and&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5, it&rsquo;s easy to let mid-rangers fall off the radar. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a device that boasts affordability without compromising on functionality, you needn&rsquo;t look any further than the&nbsp;Sony Xperia M2.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come right out and offer our opinion on the Sony Xperia M2&rsquo;s looks: this phone is&nbsp;<em>gorgeous</em>! But then, that&rsquo;s hardly surprising, as it&rsquo;s modelled closely to the top-end&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2, i.e. one of the best-looking smartphones to be launched in 2014.</p>
<p>With the same slim, iconic body (and mouth-watering purple finish), the Sony Xperia M2 is an impressive sight. A solid frame, glass panel surfaces and quality details all contribute to an overall premium looking smartphone.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>We need to remember that the Sony Xperia M2 is a mid-range smartphone, edging towards entry-level, when making judgements about it. We also need to bear that in mind when we look at the screen, because while it comes in at 4.8-inches, its&nbsp;<em>resolution</em>&nbsp;comes in at 540 x 960 pixels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the compromises made in the name of pricing the phone at lower point, and while the screen is still very nice, it&rsquo;s worth being aware that there are other (albeit more&nbsp;<em>expensive</em>) phones out there, with sharper screens.</p>
<p>For a mid-range phone, though, the Sony Xperia M2&rsquo;s screen performs brilliantly.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>As with the screen, the processor is lower-spec than you would expect in a top-end phone. However, that processor is a quad-core Snapdragon 400, so in spite of having a lower clock speed, on paper, the processor performs brilliantly in the real world.</p>
<p>The Xperia M2 is also upgradable to Android KitKat, which is going to make the performance even snappier.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Sony (in their previous incarnation, Sony Ericsson) more or less&nbsp;<em>invented</em>&nbsp;the camera phone not long after the turn of the third millennium, so you&rsquo;d expect that the camera in the Sony Xperia M2 would be rather good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be absolutely right to expect that, as it happens, because the 8MP shooter in the phone is really rather nice indeed. Again, it may not have the raw megapixel count of more expensive phones, but it&rsquo;s able to capture gorgeous, vivid photos (aided by the fact it has high dynamic range, or HDR), and that&rsquo;s what really matters.</p>

</strong>Extras</h2>
<p>In this section, we were&nbsp;<em>hoping</em>&nbsp;to say that the killer feature on the Xperia M2 is water-resistance, but alas, that was not a feature that survived the translation to an entry-level phone. Instead, we&rsquo;ll note that the phone has ANT+ support.</p>
<p>While that may not be a term you&rsquo;ve heard of before, what it means is that the Sony Xperia M2 is interoperable with (i.e. &ldquo;<em>will work with</em>&rdquo;) a wider range of devices, from health monitors to connected&nbsp;<em>bicycles</em>, and as the success of things like the FitBit has shown, that&rsquo;s a feature a growing number of people will find a use for.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>We have to say, right here, that the final score for the Sony Xperia M2 is not quite as high as it should have been. The screen could do with being a little bit higher resolution (720p would be perfect for that screen size), but the big reason why we&rsquo;ve docked it a couple of marks is because it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>water-resistant. That may not be essential for every customer, but it&rsquo;s something we were really hoping to see, given this phone&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Other than that quibble, though, we have no reservations in recommending the Sony Xperia M2. It&rsquo;s a beautiful phone that performs brilliantly, and if you&rsquo;re looking for your first experience of big-screen smartphones, then it might just be perfect for you!&nbsp;</strong></p>
