<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple lovers, control yourselves!</span></p>
<p>Have you heard the news yet? You&rsquo;re in for a real treat. Over in Brooklyn, Tim Cook <em>et al </em>made some pretty major announcements today. Yes, the much-awaited Apple event saw the launch of three new Apple products. If you missed <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/october-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the event</a> itself, never fear. Here is a quick rundown of the highlights!</p>
<h2>1) Apple Has Gone All &lsquo;Eco-Friendly&rsquo; on Us</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest announcements of the event was the brand new MacBook Air. It&rsquo;s the first time that the Air model has undergone a makeover since way back in 2015.</p>
<p>The mega brand has seriously delivered when it comes to design and innovation here. The updated incarnation of the ultra-light laptop will be made of 100% recycled aluminium, making it the greenest ever addition to the lineup.</p>
<h2>2) The MacBook Air Will Be Almost Bezeless</h2>
<p>The all-screen look is uber popular when it comes to smartphones, but the people at Apple have taken the same ethos with the new MacBook.</p>
<p>Yes, the 13.3-inch Retina Display is proof of just that. It&rsquo;s an almost bezeless (all-screen) look of the top half of the laptop, which gives it a super minimal and slick design.</p>

<h2>3) Oh, and It Will Have Touch ID Sensor Too</h2>
<p>Again, following in the footsteps of the modern-day smartphones, the latest MacBook Air has yet another update you&rsquo;ll want to know about.</p>
<p>The Touch ID sensor allows you to unlock your laptop with your fingerprint. That means waving a long goodbye to passwords and the like. It&rsquo;s most certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>4) That&rsquo;s Not All the MacBook Air Has to Offer</h2>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not all&hellip; The MacBook Air will also have super-fast performance, a backlit keyboard, a cool Hi-Fi speaker system and even a larger trackpad than ever before.</p>
<p>All of the above means that it&rsquo;s one of the most advanced entry-level MacBooks we&rsquo;ve seen yet. It&rsquo;s sure to win over a whole load of people this time around.</p>
<h2>5) The iPad Pro Is Basically &lsquo;All Screen&rsquo; Too</h2>
<p>As though the MacBook Air weren&rsquo;t enough to whip us into a frenzy, there&rsquo;s the iPad Pro too. The tablet has also undergone a dramatic redesign here.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, it looks like the iPad of the future and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. The nearly bezeless design and lack of a home button means that it looks like an entirely new product.</p>

<h2>6) You Can Open It With Face ID</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how you open the new iPad Pro if it&rsquo;s not got a home button. Ah, that's where things get seriously interesting.</p>
<p>This is the first iPad to be fitted with the facial recognition software we&rsquo;ve seen on iPhone X. That means that, you guessed it, you have to use FaceID to unlock the product. Nice.</p>
<h2>7) There&rsquo;s a New Mac Mini Too</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re more of a desktop fan than a laptop lover, you might be interested in this final titbit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/october-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Event</a>, there was one other addition &ndash;&nbsp;the new Mac Mini. The device is the smallest desktop yet packing both 4 and 6-core eighth-generation Intel processors. That means that it can compete, in terms of power, with MacBooks too.</p>
