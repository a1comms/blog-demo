<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Messenger's new&nbsp;football game counts towards my daily exercise, right?</span></p>
<p>Facebook Messenger &ndash; the <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/10-facebook-messenger-tricks-thatll-change-your-life">app with more tricks</a> up its sleeve than Harry Houdini himself &ndash; has a new hidden game. And yes, it is more addictive than the basketball one.</p>
<p>To celebrate Euro 2016 and Copa Am&eacute;rica, Facebook has added a keepy-uppie style football game to its Messenger app, and I&rsquo;ve already wasted too much of my day playing.</p>
<p>Like the basketball game, which, I kid you not, gave me a repetitive strain injury after playing for&nbsp;too long, the hidden football game is launched by messaging a football emoji to a friend and tapping it.</p>
<p>And, again like the basketball game (which is launched by sending a basketball emoji, if you hadn&rsquo;t worked it out), the format is super simple, yet mischievously addictive. The aim is to keep the football in the air for as long as you can, in an effort to out-keepy-uppie your friend.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdavidm%2Fvideos%2F10157150390520195%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But the game isn&rsquo;t limited to a one-on-one setup; you can take on a bunch of friends by creating a group chat, and all compete for bragging rights. Just make sure everyone involved has the latest version of Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>So far, reactions I&rsquo;ve seen claim Messenger&rsquo;s hidden football game is more of a challenge than the basketball one. I&rsquo;d have to agree, but then again, I have switched to my weaker finger since straining myself on the digital basketball court.</p>
<p><strong>I need to get out more.</strong></p>
