<p><span class="postStandFirst">EE Power Bar is back! Everyone who failed to text in their claim in April, can do so from 24th June.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6536" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/EE-Power-Bar-launches-3-1024x724.jpg" alt="EE Power Bar" width="700" height="495" /></p>
<p>EE launched its popular Power Bar promotion last April, leasing free portable charges to all of its customers in an effort to combat battery frustrations.</p>
<p>The campaign was such a success, seeing EE receive a million requests in just four days, that it&rsquo;s re-launching to everyone who missed the initial claim period.</p>
<p>From 24th June, you can request a free EE Power Bar by texting POWER to 365. You&rsquo;ll receive a response containing your unique code that you&rsquo;ll need to take in store to get your charger.</p>
<p>The EE Power Bar offer is open to everyone on EE&rsquo;s expansive network, including customers on T-Mobile and Orange.</p>
<p>The same goes for EE&rsquo;s home broadband customers. Though you will need to text JOIN, plus your EE landline number, to 60005.</p>
<p>Texts for mobile and broadband customers cost just 35p.</p>

<p>The EE Power Bar, which comes clad in EE&rsquo;s vibrant branding, holds 2600mAh of power.</p>
<p>That's enough juice to refuel most mobile phones from empty to full. Or roughly the amount needed for a 10-hour binge on Candy Crush Saga.</p>
<p>It features a microUSB charger and an LED torch, which could come in handy when you&rsquo;re trying to conserve battery on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Those not with EE can get their hands on an EE Power Bar too, however, a charge of &pound;20 applies.</strong></p>
