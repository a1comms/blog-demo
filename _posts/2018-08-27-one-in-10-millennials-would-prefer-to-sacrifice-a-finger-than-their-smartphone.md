<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Play the sickest game of &lsquo;would you rather&rsquo; yet!</span></p>
<p>Have you ever played &lsquo;would you rather?&rsquo; The chances are that if you&rsquo;re a millennial, you&rsquo;ll have dabbled in this playground game. You know the drill. You think up two equally horrible options and utter those fear-inciting words in your pal&rsquo;s ear. The person answering then has the tricky job of deciding which of the choices is least awful.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it&rsquo;s a <em>lot </em>of fun. Especially when people squirm.</p>
<p>Bringing this time-old tradition well and truly into 2018, <a href="https://tappable.co.uk/millennials-rather-lose-a-finger-than-smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tappable</a> conducted a survey to find out what people would be willing to give up in favour of their smartphone. Of course, since almost every element of modern life is made quicker and easier by this little device, the 18-24 year olds who took part had quite the task on their hands. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to look at the results, shall we?</p>

<h2>Fingers vs. Smartphones</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most terrifyingly revealing results from the survey was that one in ten of the participants would prefer to give up a finger than their phone. Take a moment to let that sink in. They would allow someone to mutate them by taking a finger of their choice rather than handing over the essential tech piece. Mind-boggling.</p>
<h2>Senses vs. Smartphones</h2>
<p>Smell, touch, hearing, sight, and taste &ndash;&nbsp;these are the five senses that most of us are blessed with. But have you ever thought what it must be like to give one up? As part of the survey, participants were asked whether they&rsquo;d rather give up one of these or their smartphone. A whopping 23% would say bye, bye to a sense instead of their device. Personally, I think that shows that they&rsquo;ve <em>already</em> lost their senses&hellip;</p>

<h2>Drinking vs. Smartphones</h2>
<p>Trying to curb your drinking? Are you drinking one-too-many glasses of wine these days? &nbsp;We all know that consuming too much alcohol is a terrible vice, but would you pick it over your smartphone? It&rsquo;s a tough one. Surprisingly, 38% of millennials said that they would quit drinking booze altogether if it meant they could keep their phone.</p>
<h2>Travel vs. Smartphones</h2>
<p>We already know that millennials have a terrible case of wanderlust, but 16% of them said that they would quit travelling to save their smartphone. Presumably, some young people would rather scroll through gorgeous landscapes on Instagram than get out there and visit them for themselves. Yes, that&rsquo;s the world we live in today.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no doubt that smartphones are vital to life. One anonymous woman who took part in the study put it best when she said, &ldquo;My phone is integrated into every part of my life. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly live without it.&rdquo; I hear you loud and clear. But, having said that, I think I&rsquo;d still rather keep all of my fingers and senses than my smartphone. Sorry not sorry.</p>
