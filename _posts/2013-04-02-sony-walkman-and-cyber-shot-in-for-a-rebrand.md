<p><span class="postStandFirst">It looks as though Sony is in the midst of revamping the Walkman and Cyber-shot brands to integrate them into the Sony range of smartphones.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://goodlogo.com/images/logos/sony_walkman_logo_3428.gif" width="400" height="235" /></strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, before the real dawn of the modern smartphone, Sony (then in partnership with another giant of the mobile world, to form Sony Ericsson) made some of the absolute&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;mobile phones money could buy.</p>
<p>Phones such as the iconic Sony Ericsson K750 rocked the entire&nbsp;<em>world</em>&nbsp;with how simply&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>&nbsp;they were, but there were&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;brands that really allowed Sony Ericsson to dominate both the worlds of camera phones&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;music phones.</p>
<p>The key to Sony Ericsson&rsquo;s success was undoubtedly the double-header of Cyber-shot and Walkman phones.</p>
<p>Today, although Sony has already found some of its old glory in the shape of the powerful,&nbsp;<em>magnificent</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia Z</a>, rumours are rife that these two brands are set to make a triumphant return to the company&rsquo;s smartphone portfolio. To see why this is such a big deal, perhaps it might pay to take a look at just why these brands were so important to mobile phones in the first place&hellip;</p>
<h2>Cyber-shot - redefining the camera phone</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick test: try to name a modern mobile phone which&nbsp;<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;have a camera. Other than ultra-cheap pay-as-you-go phones, or corporate/government phones which aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>allowed</em>&nbsp;to have cameras (in an effort to prevent industrial espionage, or actual, honest to goodness government espionage), the list of phones that don&rsquo;t have a camera is&nbsp;<em>vanishingly</em>&nbsp;small. The simple fact is that people want cameras on their phones, whether they want a high-end snapper like the PureView technology which Nokia pioneered, or a mid-range HTC Android phone to upload their pics to Facebook.</p>
<p>The Cyber-shot brand is one of the things that directly&nbsp;<em>caused</em>&nbsp;this state of affairs.</p>
<p>Imagine a 5 inch, 13MP superphone like the Sony Xperia Z. Now imagine that&rsquo;s been given new, enhanced Cyber-shot lenses and, more importantly, the same&nbsp;<em>proper</em>&nbsp;xenon flash found in the old K750. At a stroke, that could become the best camera phone&nbsp;<em>ever</em>&nbsp;made!</p>
<h2>Walkman - the brand that launched a thousand music players</h2>
<p>Anyone who was around in the 80s will instinctively recognise the name &lsquo;Walkman&rsquo;, because with that one word, Sony invented the very&nbsp;<em>concept</em>&nbsp;of a truly portable music player. The Walkman name was also used in portable mp3 players, but the important fact is that it eventually found a home in mobile phones. While the Walkman brand never had&nbsp;<em>quite</em>&nbsp;the same impact on the mobile world as the Cyber-shot brand, one simply needs to look at the current mobile industry to see how important music is to modern smartphones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the&nbsp;iPhone 5s, with iTunes. There&rsquo;s the new&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4, which allows users to link five phones together for&nbsp;<em>proper</em>&nbsp;surround sound. There&rsquo;s the Nokia Music services on the likes of the&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 930.</p>
<p>Put simply, music is important, and the Walkman brand is a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;opportunity for Sony to take advantage of. As of yet, this rumour remains unconfirmed, but it would make a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;of sense for Sony to go down this route. After all, we&rsquo;ve all seen how amazing the Sony Xperia Z is; imagine how awesome it would be if Sony took that, and added the extra Cyber-shot and Walkman features.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, even if they&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t</em>, their star is still very much in the ascendant. With phones like the Sony Xperia Z already existing, the future&rsquo;s looking rather rosy indeed for the Japanese giant!</strong></p>
