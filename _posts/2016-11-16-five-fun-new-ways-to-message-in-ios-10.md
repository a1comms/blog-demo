<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">These new iMessage features will blow your mind.</span></p>
<p>With each iOS release, Apple introduces new features for our iPhones. Some are practical. Some are fun. Some you might not even notice. And some you definitely will, like all the snazzy new ways you can talk to friends in iMessage.</p>
<p>With iOS 10, you can be <em>way </em>more expressive when the occasion calls for it. Full screen effects let you congratulate someone in style, and the ability to send handwritten notes adds a personal touch that might win some brownie points with your partner.</p>
<p>However you use the new effects on your iPhone, messaging between your friends and family promises to never be the same again. To get started, you first need to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the latest version of iOS, which you can do by going to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
<p>With that sorted, it&rsquo;s time for our five favourite new ways to message in iOS 10.</p>
<h2>Make Your Tone Understood</h2>
<p>Using the new bubble effects in iMessage, you&rsquo;ll be able to get your feelings across almost as clearly as a face-to-face conversation. If you type a message and hold the send arrow, you&rsquo;ll get to choose from four options: INVISIBLE INK, GENTLE, LOUD and SLAM. (Forget invisible ink for now, we&rsquo;ll cover that below.)</p>

<p>Each label adds a different effect to the delivery of your message. If you&rsquo;re trying to be a little tentative, you&rsquo;d want to choose send with a gentle touch. Conversely, if someone&rsquo;s ignoring you, or you&rsquo;re getting a little excited, the loud effect fits perfectly. Lastly, sending a message with a slam might help emphasise a point, like thanking a friend, or confirming some details.</p>
<h2>Respond Quickly for Added Ease</h2>
<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t have the time to type a response, or you&rsquo;d prefer to reply with something a little simpler. Apple&rsquo;s new Tapback feature for iOS 10 opens up a tray of quick responses for you to choose from, including a heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, HAHA, exclamation marks and a question mark. To open the Tapback tray, just double tap a message.</p>

<h2>Send Soppy Love Notes</h2>
<p>Depending on who you&rsquo;re messaging, you might find different uses for the new handwriting feature. If your partner&rsquo;s having a tough day at work, a little love note might cheer them up. Or if you want to make an immature friend laugh, you might come up with NSFW doodles to send. Your only limit is&nbsp;your own imagination.</p>
<p>To draw a handwritten message, make sure your screen lock is turned off. The quickest way to do this is from the control panel, which you can open by sliding your finger up from the base of your screen. The lock is controlled by the small padlock inside a circular arrow icon.</p>
<p>Once switched off, open an iMessage conversation, tap inside the Text Message field, then tilt your iPhone on to its side. When you&rsquo;re finished writing or doodling, tilt your iPhone back to an upright position and send.</p>

<h2>Intrigue with a Little Mystery</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the type who loves to tease, then you&rsquo;ll be all over the invisible ink feature new to iMessage. Using it, you can disguise text messages and images that your contact has to reveal (with a swipe) to see. To shroud your message or media in mystery, hold down the send arrow and select INVISIBLE INK.</p>
<h2>Get the Party Started</h2>
<p>Our favourite new iMessage feature is the selection of full screen effects. The choice of sending a message with either balloons, confetti, lasers, fireworks, shooting stars or celebration sparkles is a game-changer for messaging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end of scenarios where the full screen effects could come in use. Birthdays are a given, likewise for a job promotion or an exciting piece of news. To add some style to your message, hold down the send arrow. You&rsquo;ll read Send with effect at the top of your iPhone screen, and beneath you&rsquo;ll see two tabs labelled Bubble and Screen. Select Screen, then flick through the effects to find the most fitting, choosing one&nbsp;by pressing the send arrow.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nothing says 'happy birthday' like a screen full of balloons! Or 'let's get ready to party' like a load of lasers: https://t.co/QJOfRW2rAU pic.twitter.com/bVukRZr1X9</p>

<p>N.B. If any of the above&nbsp;effects aren&rsquo;t working, it might be because you&rsquo;ve got Reduce Motion switched on. iOS 10.1 (or later versions) fixes this issue, which you can download by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Alternatively, you can switch Reduce Motion off by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.</p>
