<div id="stcpDiv"><span class="postStandFirst">Now that the LG G3 has been officially unveiled, it&rsquo;s time to pit it against its biggest rival, the wildly popular Samsung Galaxy S5. We compare the two phones in terms of their designs, their power, their screens, their cameras, and any little extra features that could swing your vote either way. LG G3 vs Samsung Galaxy S5: who will win in this clash of the titans?</span></div>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4303" alt="14288329932_85491ef62a" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14288329932_85491ef62a.jpg" width="414" height="500" />Everyone has been waiting with bated breath for the official unveiling of the LG G3, the latest superphone from Korean manufacturer LG, a phone whose mission statement is simple: beat Samsung.</div>
<div>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s been unveiled, we can finally take a look at how well the LG G3 does in pursuit of that goal. So, settle in and get comfy, because it&rsquo;s time for another superphone showdown, as the newly announced LG G3 goes up against the mighty Samsung Galaxy S5!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4304" alt="14141827220_36d28cea1c" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14141827220_36d28cea1c.jpg" width="500" height="320" />We&rsquo;ll start with the completely subjective category, namely the two phones respective designs, their aesthetics, and the first point we have to make is that both phones are <em>really</em> nice-looking. Both have a sleek body, but although it&rsquo;s a close thing, the LG G3 just wins this category by virtue of its simulated metallic finish.</p>
<p>Sure, it might not be actual metal (as you would get on the HTC One M8, for example), but it still looks fantastic, and combined with the thinner bezels round the screen, it does give LG&rsquo;s new baby an edge when it comes to looks.</p>
<p>And so, the winner of the design category is the LG G3.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong></strong>Power</h2>
<p><strong></strong>We move on now to a category that&rsquo;s destined to end in a draw, because the simple fact is this: the internal specifications of these two smartphones are virtually identical. Both use a Snapdragon 801 processor clocked to 2.5Ghz, both have 2GB of RAM, and both offer the same options in onboard storage, namely a choice of 16 or 32GB. Oh, and top of that, both phones come with a microSD slot.<strong></strong></p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Since there&rsquo;s really nothing in it, the end result is that the power category comes out as a draw.</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4305" alt="14305368536_84c78e128f" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14305368536_84c78e128f.jpg" width="500" height="422" />Next up, we come to a category where there&rsquo;s most definitely going to be a clear winner, and if you&rsquo;ve been following the news around the launch of the LG G3, you&rsquo;ll know exactly which phone is going to win. To put it simply: while the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a brilliant 5.1-inch 1080p screen (with a pixel density of 432 pixels per inch), the LG G3 is the first phone from a big-name manufacturer to have a brand new Quad-HD screen, which comes in at 5.5-inches, and has a pixel density of <em>534</em> pixels per inch.</p>
<p>And so, as it outclasses the screen on <em>every phone ever made</em>, the LG G3 romps home to victory in this category!</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The LG G3&rsquo;s camera has a neat little trick up its sleeve, in the form of laser-assisted autofocus. In simple terms, this allows it to find the range to the subject of the photograph more quickly, which allows it to <em>focus</em> more quickly.</p>
<p>However, the speed with which it focuses isn&rsquo;t <em>hugely</em> faster than the Samsung Galaxy S5, and Samsung&rsquo;s phone also has a higher resolution (16MP, as opposed to 13MP on the LG), and so the Samsung Galaxy S5 wins the camera category.</p>
<h2>Extra Features</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one feature of the Samsung Galaxy S5 that we haven&rsquo;t mentioned yet, and it&rsquo;s a feature that the LG G3 lacks: the Samsung Galaxy S5, as is well known by now, is <em>water-resistant</em>. As we firmly believe that water-resistance is one of the best new features in modern smartphones, then the conclusion is simple: the Samsung Galaxy S5 wins this final category!</p>
<p><strong>And so, as often happens when pitting two superphones against each other, we have to conclude that neither of them is objectively better than the other, largely because both of them are utterly superb. If you want the better camera, in a phone that can survive a dunking in the sink, then get the Samsung Galaxy S5. If you want a prettier phone, with a screen that nothing else on the market even comes close to, grab yourself the LG G3. Either way, you&rsquo;re going to be getting one of the best phones ever made!</strong></p>
