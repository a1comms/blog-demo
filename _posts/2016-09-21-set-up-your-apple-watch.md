<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Before you can use your Apple Watch, you first need to sync it with your iPhone.</span></p>
<p>Having just splashed out on a shiny new Apple Watch, whether it&rsquo;s the first or second edition, we bet you can&rsquo;t wait to start using it&hellip; Before you get carried away, there are few things to do before you can set it up.</p>
<p>&bull; Download the latest version of iOS on your iPhone 5 or newer model, by going to Settings > General > Software Update.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure your iPhone&rsquo;s Bluetooth is on. Go to Settings > Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure your iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi (Settings > Wi-Fi) or your cellular network.</p>
<p>&bull; Switch your Apple Watch on by simply pressing the side button (next to the crown) and holding it. The Apple logo will flash on screen when it&rsquo;s powering up.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure both your iPhone and Apple Watch have at least 50% charge, or are connected to their charging cables. Keep both close together.</p>
<p>OK, now the boring necessities are out of the way, it&rsquo;s time to set up your Apple Watch.</p>

<h2>Apple Watch Setup Steps</h2>
<p>1. Choose a language and region on your Apple Watch.</p>
<p>2. Go to your iPhone and open the Apple Watch app. Tap Start Pairing, do the same on your Apple Watch and an animation should appear.</p>
<p>3. Line up the Apple Watch animation in the square viewfinder that pops up&nbsp;on your iPhone screen, until a message appears saying Your Apple Watch is Paired.</p>

<p>4. Tap Set Up as New Apple Watch on your iPhone. If your Apple Watch has been backed up previously, you can tap Restore from Backup. Choose which wrist you&rsquo;ll be wearing your Apple Watch, read the T&amp;Cs and tap Agree to progress.</p>
<p>5. Sign in with your Apple ID (for using features like Digital Touch, Apple Pay and Handoff) and tap Next.</p>
<p>6. You&rsquo;ll be prompted to create a passcode for your Apple Watch, which you&rsquo;ll need for information-sensitive features such as Apple Pay. On your iPhone tap Create a Passcode or Add a Long Passcode, then make a decision on whether you want your Watch to unlock when your iPhone&rsquo;s unlocked.</p>

<p>7. Set up the Activity app if you want feedback on your day-to-day fitness activity, by entering personal information and movement goals. You can do this later if you&rsquo;d prefer.</p>

<p>8. Finally, sync up your iPhone apps with your Apple Watch, by tapping Install All. This will give you access to all Apple Watch compatible apps straight from your wrist. If you opt for Choose Later, only basic information such as contacts, text messages and emails will sync.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Once the setup process is complete, you can customise your Apple Watch with different watch face displays, among other things, by pressing&nbsp;down the display until it vibrates, or heading to the Apple Watch app.</p>

<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Before you pair your Apple Watch with your new iPhone, you&rsquo;ll need to disconnect it from your old iPhone.</span></p>
<h5>Unpair your Apple Watch and iPhone</h5>
<p>1. Throughout the process, keep both devise next to each other.</p>
<p>2. On your iPhone, go to the Apple Watch app, followed by the My Watch tab. Here, tap your watch at the top of the screen, then the information symbol <img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/applewatch/watch-os2-info-pair-icon.png" alt="info icon" width="22" data-hires="true" />&nbsp;next to the watch you&rsquo;re unpairing.</p>

<p>3. Tap Unpair Apple Watch and confirm the action. You might be asked to enter your Apple ID credentials to disable an Activation Lock. Your Apple Watch will complete a backup before erasing its data, which you can recover when pairing it with a new iPhone.</p>
