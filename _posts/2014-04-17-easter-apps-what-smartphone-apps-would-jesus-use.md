<p><span class="postStandFirst">Join us as we take a slightly obscure and speculitve look at some Easter apps, and naturally the kind of smartphone apps Jesus would have most likely used, if smartphones like the Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One M8 had existed in 30AD.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting little thought experiment to wonder what the world might have ended up being like if people throughout human history had enjoyed the kind of access to mobile devices that we enjoy today.</p>
<p>What if Archimedes had a Sony Xperia Z2? Answer: the word &ldquo;eureka&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have become popular since he could have done the necessary sums while he was in the bath, instead of running through the town without a towel. What if Pheidippides had an HTC One M8? The London Marathon wouldn&rsquo;t exist, as he would&rsquo;ve texted Athens instead of running there (possibly while including a selfie with lots of vanquished Persians in the background).</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s Easter, in a little variation on the famous &ldquo;What Would Jesus Do?&rdquo; phrase, it&rsquo;s time to ask: what smartphone apps might Jesus, founder of the Christian Faith, have used? Let&rsquo;s take a slightly irreverent look at some top Easter Apps (and stick with it till the end, as there may very well be an actual message waiting for you)...</p>
<h2>Epicurious</h2>
<p>By any stretch of the imagination, feeding 5000 people with just 5 loaves and 2 fishes is a miracle, one that not even our mums (who are, if you remember from our Mother&rsquo;s Day special, superheroes in the kitchen) can pull off. However, He would have had a much easier time in making <em>tasty</em> meals for 5000 people, with the Epicurious app, available on both iOS and Android phones.</p>
<h2>Restaurant<strong> Finder</strong></h2>
<p>The Last Supper is one of the most well-known events in the Bible, and it&rsquo;s this final meal that gave us the Eucharist, i.e. the Holy Communion.</p>
<p>However, as anyone in the modern world knows, finding a booking for 13 people at such late notice is an absolute <em>nightmare</em>, so the Restaurant Finder app could have proven to be absolutely essential.</p>
<h2>Miracle Machine - turning water into wine (well...)</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/13888383752_7089cb0568.jpg" width="500" height="336" /></span></strong></p>
<p>This last one is less of an app, per se, and more of a brilliant publicity stunt for a truly worthwhile cause. The product in question (which was very definitely not real, so don&rsquo;t try to go and buy one) was called the Miracle Machine, and it was billed as, quite a simply, a smartphone-controlled device for turning water into wine.</p>
<p>In reality, the whole thing was a publicity stunt, designed to raise awareness for the non-profit Wine To Water aid organisation, whose mission is to bring clean water and improved sanitation to less fortunate people all round the world. So the product itself may have been a &ldquo;hoax&rdquo;, in the loosest sense of the word, but the thing it was raising awareness for is a genuine and <em>incredibly</em> worthy project.</p>
<p><strong>We can&rsquo;t help but feel that, while the first two entries on this list <em>were </em>irreverent, this last one is definitely in-line with His teachings. As Jesus himself said, &ldquo;Love thy neighbour as you love yourself,&rdquo; and at this time of year, no matter what your faith (or lack thereof) is, isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> the most important thing?</strong></p>
