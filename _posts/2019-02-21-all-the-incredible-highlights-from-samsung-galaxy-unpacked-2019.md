<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&lsquo;A whole new world of mobile&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Did you hear the news? One of the biggest annual events in the world of mobile phones happened Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Yes, Samsung Unpacked 2019 was a real whirlwind of a keynote. If you missed the live stream, don&rsquo;t panic. We&rsquo;ve got all the highlights right here.</p>
<h2>Introducing&hellip; the Samsung Galaxy Fold</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r_UgNcJtzQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Foldable phones are certainly the future &ndash; and it looks like Samsung is leading the way. The Galaxy Fold promises a phone and tablet in one. The brand-new flagship will be available in Cosmos Black, Space Silver, Martian Green, or Astro Blue.</p>
<p>When folded up, the device sports a 4.6-inch display and a whopping 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display when opened. The true meaning of a phablet. What&rsquo;s more, the hinges are hidden, which means that the transition should be completely seamless.</p>
<p>The huge Infinity Flex Display is certain to have a whole load of advantages, not least of which is the three-app feature. Yes, that literally means that you can run three different apps on the screen at the same time. You might be watching YouTube while taking notes while replying to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The phone is certain to be pretty nifty too. It will boast a whopping 512GB of memory, plus the snazzy-sounding Universal Flash Storage 3.0, which will help deliver super-fast speeds. On top of that, the Galaxy Fold is set to have six cameras; three on the back, two on the inside, and one inside. Pretty impressive stuff.</p>
<p>So, when can you get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy Fold? Well, the flagship phone is going to be available from 26th April (although it's still unclear which markets it will land in). As for the starting price, it&rsquo;s set at $1,980 (just over &pound;1,500) and the price will depend on your region.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus and S10e</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCfgkIyD9g0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Next up, it&rsquo;s the new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog%20article&amp;utm_campaign=samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy S10 range</a>. Sporting the world&rsquo;s first Dynamic AMOLED Infinity-O Display, Samsung claims that the S10 Plus will have the &lsquo;most colour accurate&rsquo; screen on any smartphone. Plus, it reduces blue light emissions by 42% without a filter, which is good news for both your eyes and your bedtime routine.</p>
<p>When it comes to security features, Samsung is <em>not </em>holding back. One of the highlights of the Galaxy S10 line-up is sure to be the Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, which works at optimal level in both wet and super bright weather (oh, and it lives <em>beneath</em> the screen). That should mean that you can unlock your phone in seconds regardless of rain or shine.</p>
<p>On the rear of the S10 and S10 Plus, there&rsquo;s a professional-style triple camera setup, including an ultra-wide lens for panoramic shots. The camera will also use AI tech to identify up to 30 different scenes. When it comes to videos, Samsung is breaking yet more ground. The device will be the first to shoot clips in HDR 10+ quality and will boast a version of Adobe Premiere Rush.</p>
<p><em>Fancy catching up on the entire event? Watch it below.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISjiJQGJ72o" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Want to up your selfie game? The S10 Plus could well be the answer. The front camera has a &lsquo;significantly improved autofocus&rsquo; which should help you along the way. On top of that, there are actually two front camera lenses &ndash;&nbsp;a 10MP and 8MP offering &ndash; which will improve depth of field. There will also be an &lsquo;Instagram mode&rsquo;, which pairs up with the app and allows you to post your selfies straight to the social media platform.</p>
<p>When it comes to what&rsquo;s under the hood, there&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> power. The Galaxy S10 Plus offers &lsquo;laptop level storage without the laptop.&rsquo; The phone will boast up to 1TB of storage and a remarkable 8GB of RAM. There&rsquo;s also an &lsquo;all day battery&rsquo; that lasts up to 25% longer than the previous one. That storage and power mean that the device is ideal for gaming, streaming and more.</p>
<p>All three phones will be available in a range of colours and each is bigger than the next. In size order, you&rsquo;ve got the S10e, S10, and then the S10 Plus. The prices will also follow that sequence too. Oh, and as an added bonus, they will all come in eco-friendly packaging.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10 5G</h2>
<p>It seems that the company has one more smartphone up its sleeve. Samsung claim that 5G will be &lsquo;faster than any network we&rsquo;ve seen&rsquo; and with that, they have also announced the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. It will have a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED Display, which is apparently the biggest screen ever on an S-series phone. It also has a 3D depth-sensing camera and a Realistic AR Experience. Remarkable.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Buds</h2>
<h2><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzt2PchQAI4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting additions to Samsung&rsquo;s line-up is the Galaxy Buds. They look minimalist and pretty darn awesome. Aside from playing sound, they also have Adaptive Dual Microphones, which are &lsquo;smart&rsquo;. That means that they switch between mics depending on how loud your surroundings are. The battery life sounds great too, offering five hours of calls or up to six hours of music play.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s exciting is you can claim a free pair of Galaxy Buds when you <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog%20article&amp;utm_campaign=samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order either Samsung Galaxy S10 or S10 Plus at Buymobiles.net</a>. Hurry the offer will disappear when the pre-order period ends&hellip;</p>
<h2>Galaxy Watch Active and Galaxy Fit</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRTqadjEkiQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>But wait, what about wearable tech? It looks like Samsung has us covered yet again. The Watch Active is super slim in light aluminium. It&rsquo;s 5ATM water resistant with an intuitive interface, allowing you to check your wellness stats at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s the Galaxy Fit which is &lsquo;about as light as a single strawberry&rsquo;. It has a long-lasting battery that lasts for around a week. Plus, it has a cool colour AMOLED display, which means that it looks attractive and bright.</p>
<p>Both brand new wearables have a range of tracking features. They have heart rate monitors, stress tracking features, and sleep tracking. As though all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, they will also work seamlessly with other Galaxy products. It&rsquo;s all part of the &lsquo;Galaxy Ecosystem&rsquo;, i.e. a simple network of connectivity between devices.</p>
