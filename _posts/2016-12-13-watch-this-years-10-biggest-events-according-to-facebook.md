<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Where's the dislike button for 2016?</span></p>
<p>As the year draws to a close, it&rsquo;s time to reflect on all that&rsquo;s happened over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>With celebrity deaths, political controversy, and Kanye West&rsquo;s sheer insanity, it&rsquo;s been a hard slog. And yet, here we are, finally reaching the end of what has been one of the, erm, more <em>interesting</em> years in recent memory.</p>
<p>And just when you thought 2017 would be the savour you hoped for, this happened.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you thought 2016 was bad - I'm releasing an album in 2017.</p>
<p>&mdash; James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesBlunt/status/808599054989070336">13 December 2016</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway. Have you noticed that Facebook has rolled out the Your Year in Review feature once again?</p>
<p>That means we can all look back at our personal highlights of 2016, complied into a short video. Whether you want to relive your year is probably up for debate, however, it's certainly worth checking out 2016's biggest global events, according to Facebook.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10155278547321729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Top Facebook Live videos</h2>
<p>While Facebook Live was actually launched back in 2015, this year saw it seriously take off in a big way. Before now, it had only been tentatively used by companies and celebs to promote themselves. Over the last few months, though, everyday Facebook users (that&rsquo;s you and me) started getting in on the action. I mean, what&rsquo;s not to love? You simply hit a button and start streaming a live video to all your friends and family.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frickygervais%2Fvideos%2F492264527564572%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400" width="400" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>As part of Facebook&rsquo;s annual review, the officials decided to share what the top ten global Live videos were in 2016. So, what video do you think made the number one spot? Do you imagine that it was some high profile celeb doing a live interview, or perhaps even Zuckerberg himself? Well, you&rsquo;re wrong! It was actually a video of&hellip; *drum roll*... Candace Payne AKA Chewbacca Mom! Bet you didn&rsquo;t see that one coming. Also on the list were videos from Buzzfeed, NBC News, and Viral Thread.</p>

<h2>Most Popular Topics</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll all agree that 2016 was a whirlwind of a year. From Brexit to Trump, there have been many controversial issues that have simply rocked our world. Whenever something big happens, people love nothing more than to delve into the debate with a well-thought-out Facebook status. So, what on earth have people been talking about on Facebook? Well, here are the ten most talked about issues of 2016:</p>
<ol>
<li>US Presidential Election</li>
<li>Brazilian Politics</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;mon Go</li>
<li>Black Lives Matter</li>
<li>Rodrigo Duterte &amp; Philippine Presidential Election</li>
<li>The Olympics</li>
<li>Brexit</li>
<li>Super Bowl</li>
<li>David Bowie</li>
<li>Muhammad Ali</li>
</ol>
<p>While we probably could have guessed what would be on this year&rsquo;s list, there are a few surprises in there. Who could have guessed that people would chit-chat more about the likes of Pok&eacute;mon Go than Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s death? Whether you loved it or hated it, it will soon be time to say goodbye to this year once and for all. Who knows what 2017 will bring for Facebook? We can&rsquo;t wait to find out!</p>
<p>*Looks up to sky, clasps hands in prayer, and whispers, "Please not James Blunt."*</p>
