<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">With the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy S8, many of you may be hoping to make the technological switch. But, hold on, what if everything - your contacts, your mail, your texts, your life - is saved on your iPhone? How can you possibly make this massive transition? Luckily, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s how you can transfer over just about everything you will need.</span></p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a music fan, you may be worried about how you&rsquo;re going to recover all your playlists when you switch devices. Well, never fear, there are many ways in which you can keep all your fave tunes at no extra hassle. If you&rsquo;re using any of the major streaming platforms (from Spotify to Apple Music), it&rsquo;s shockingly easy. You just need to download the app and login. Yes, surprisingly, there is an Android version of the Apple Music app. Phew.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re kind of old school and still use the likes of iTunes to collect music, you will still be able to get it all back. First of all, you need to use the laptop or computer where your iTunes is based. You should then download Google's <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/manager">Music Manager</a> app onto the device you&rsquo;re using and link it to your music collection. Once you&rsquo;ve done so, you can use the same app to stream all your songs to your Samsung phone.</p>
<h3>Photos and videos</h3>
<p>Over the years, you&rsquo;ve likely amassed a whole load of perfectly posed selfies and oh-so-hilarious videos on your iPhone. If that&rsquo;s the case, the last thing you want to do is lose all those memories for good. Luckily, you really don&rsquo;t have to!</p>
<p>You will first need to install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-photos-free-photo-and-video-storage/id962194608?mt=8">Google Photos</a> app on your existing iPhone. Then you can use the app to backup all your photos and videos that you have stored on the phone right now. Once you switch phones to the Samsung, you will just need to login to your Google Photos account and all your most precious media will be right there waiting for you. And&hellip; breathe!</p>
<h3>Mail, Contacts, and Calendar</h3>
<p>These days, most people tend to use a Gmail account for their emails. If you&rsquo;ve linked your Gmail with your iPhone (and Contacts and Calendar), transferring everything over is basically a doddle. You simply need to head to <b>Settings > Mail > Accounts </b>on your iPhone beforehand and ensure that the sync &lsquo;toggle&rsquo; is on. That way, when you login to the account on your new Samsung phone, everything will be carried over in minutes.</p>
<p>If you happen to be using an iCloud account things will, of course, be a little trickier. You will first need to download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.carddav.icloud">SmoothSync for Cloud Contacts</a> app and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.caldav.icloud">SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar</a> app on your Samsung phone. Once you login (using your iCloud account information), you will find that all the contact and calendar info transfers right away.</p>
<h3>Text messages</h3>
<p>Most people won&rsquo;t worry all that much about transferring over their iMessages, but if this is an issue for you, there&rsquo;s a way that you can do it. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faked.isms2droid">iSMS2droid</a> app will help you transfer over all your text messaging history from iMessages, which means that you needn&rsquo;t worry at all. You should download the app onto your Samsung as soon as you get it. After that, backing up all of the information you have should be something of a breeze.</p>
<p>And there you have it! With the help of a few handy hacks and apps, switching from being an Apple follower to the likes of Samsung needn&rsquo;t be the huge stress you imagine it to be. Sure, it may take an hour or so to get everything you need transferred over, but in the end, it will be very much worth your time.</p>
