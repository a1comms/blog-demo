<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">With these smart devices, you can track and look after the people and things you care most about. All from your smartphone.</span></p>
<p>By now you&rsquo;ll have seen Martin Freeman on the TV stealing a child&rsquo;s bag and hiding in a cupboard (if you haven&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ve got you covered). It&rsquo;s OK, there&rsquo;s nothing dodgy going on, it&rsquo;s a new set of ads to promote V by Vodafone.</p>
<p>But what is this V by Vodafone malarkey? It's a range of smart devices, designed to help you keep an eye on all the important things in your life. All in one place and all from the comfort of your smartphone.</p>
<p>The future is exciting, right?</p>

<h2>V-Bag: For Serial Bag Losers</h2>
<p>Backpack, handbag, night out clutch, V-Bag is ideal for any scenario where there&rsquo;s a bag involved. The idea is that you&rsquo;ll never be able to lose your bag again with this GPS tracker.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get instant alert notifications too when your bag's on the move.&nbsp;V-Bag is a hardy device as well; it's water and dust resistant with a huge 4-day battery life no less.</p>
<p>When the V-Bag tracker is connected with a V-Sim, you can find your bag in places without the need for Bluetooth or WiFi. So even in a game of extreme hide and seek, you'll still have the upper hand.</p>
<p>Remember, connected means protected folks.</p>

<p><em>Part 1: The CHASE!</em></p>

<h2>V-Pet: Get Your Pet Online</h2>
<p>Keep track of your pet with a Kippy&rsquo;s V-Pet GPS tracker and always know if they&rsquo;re safe and sound. They&rsquo;re part of the family after all.</p>
<p>Designate a safe zone for your pet in the app and receive alerts if your pet wonders off outside your designated zones.</p>
<p>You can also monitor your pet&rsquo;s activity and get handy pet health tips beamed direct to your smartphone. Playing, walking, running, you&rsquo;ll be able to get a picture of how active your pet is being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to get the full service in areas with Vodafone network coverage and GPS signal, removing the need to rely on Bluetooth or WiFi signal.</p>

<p><em>Part 2: The STARE OFF!</em></p>

<h2>V-Auto: Prove Who's the Best Driver</h2>
<p>This is essentially one of those little black boxes we&rsquo;ve all heard so much about, to go on your car.</p>
<p>The V-Auto device is a pretty clever bit of kit though. In the event of a collision, an auto SOS feature means someone calls you to see if help is required.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re the best driver in the family? The V-Auto Driver Safety Score feature will compare how you drive day to day and give you a score. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like being rated on your driving is there!</p>
<p>Not only do you get these features, there&rsquo;s more. Help find your car in that huge car park, or on that maze of streets with the track your car feature. You'll also be able to see your journeys and all the miles you've covered.</p>
<p>So, track your trips, find your car, and have safer journeys. Not bad, eh?</p>

<h2>V-Camera: Keep an Eye on the Kids</h2>
<p>Another part of the V by Vodafone repertoire is the Arla Go V-camera, capturing everything to give you that extra piece of mind when it comes to security.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 4G and wirefree, not to mention it's built to live in or outside. How about a month-long battery without being connected with wires or cables? Pretty good, right? This camera doesn&rsquo;t mess about.</p>
<p>A two-way communication feature means you can talk and listen from your smartphone. V-Camera gives motion and sound detection alerts straight to your smartphone too, as well as having night vision, a weatherproof design and wide-angle camera coverage. It's got all the gear for solid security and it's not bad for keeping an eye on the kids in the garden.</p>
<p>Check-in from abroad too, and see if everything is OK back home from the comfort of your sun lounger. Lovely, I&rsquo;ll have another White Russian please.</p>
