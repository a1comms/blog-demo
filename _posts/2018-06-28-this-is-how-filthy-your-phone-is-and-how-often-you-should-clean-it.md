<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s actually more often than you think!</span></p>
<p>Confession time: I have <em>never </em>cleaned my phone. Not once. In fact, until I sat down today to write this post, the thought had never crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Why would it? Phones are shiny little devices. They look pretty darn clean so they must be clean, right?</p>
<p><em>Wrong!</em></p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="http://time.com/5310453/clean-my-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Time Magazine</a>, Philip Tierno, a clinical professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University&rsquo;s Langone School of Medicine, revealed the truth we&rsquo;d all been denying to ourselves: Our phones are utterly filthy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the germs on your device can make you ill &ndash;&nbsp;especially if you happen to use your phone while eating.</p>
<p>When you touch your phone, these germs or bacteria stick to your hands. If you&rsquo;re consuming food, that means that you can unconsciously end up eating them. Gross.</p>
<p>As though that wasn't enough to give you nightmares, you could also find that they enter your system through your ears, nose, and eyes.</p>

<h2>So, How Often Should You Clean Your Phone?</h2>
<p>If, like me, you don&rsquo;t give much thought to the act of cleaning your phone, it could be time to change your ways.</p>
<p>Making this simple task a part of your regular routine could be all that it takes to make sure that you don&rsquo;t accidentally get sick by ingesting these germs. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t eat while using your phone, you probably don&rsquo;t need to worry much.</p>
<p>Tierno says that he cleans his smartphone about twice a day &ndash; one time in the morning and once more in the evening. It might sound like a serious commitment but it could be the way to go.</p>
<p>After all, if anyone knows how crucial it is to clean your phone regularly, it&rsquo;s sure to be a super smart professor. I&rsquo;m convinced.</p>

<h2>How to Clean Your Phone</h2>
<p>Before you even attempt to clean your device, you need to turn it off. That&rsquo;s cleaning 101.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> and other phone providers recommend this simple tip.</p>
<p>You should also use a soft cloth to wipe the surface of the device. Of course, you want to avoid getting liquid on your phone as it may damage it. With this in mind, it could be worth using a pre-treated wipe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not all. You should also make sure that you wash your hands before eating and maybe put your phone down at the dinner table. It&rsquo;s good manners and will stop you picking up nasty germs from your device. Win-win.</p>
<p>Here's a handy little video to help you clean your mobile phone.</p>
