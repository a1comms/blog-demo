<p>Samsung lovers will be excited to hear that there are already rumours flying about the next flagship device.</p>
<p>Yes, we may have a good few months to wait for the official S10 release, and yet the whispers of what that launch means are already rife.</p>
<p>Should history repeat itself, Samsung will launch their next flagship device at the start of the new year as part of the annual Mobile World Congress.</p>

<h2>What Can We Expect?</h2>
<p>This time around, though, we may see as many as three or four brand-new Samsung Galaxy S10 phones being launched, according to a report from MobielKopen.</p>
<p>The post suggests that there will be the standard S10 and S10 Plus launches, as per. In addition, however, there may be a surprise or two in store for us all. Yes, we could be looking at a budget-friendly offering too, the likes of which could compete with iPhone XR.</p>

<h2>What About the Elusive Fourth S10 Mobile?</h2>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get our hearts racing, there&rsquo;s yet another rumour from the German site. The report suggests that there could be a fourth Samsung mobile that offers 5G capabilities.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of what the report says about each of the supposed Samsung S10 models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model one &ndash; 5.8-inch display with a single-lens camera</li>
<li>Model two &ndash; 5.8-inch display with a dual-camera</li>
<li>Model three &ndash; 6.44-inch display with a triple-lens camera</li>
<li>Model four &ndash; 6.44-inch display, with a triple-lens camera and 5G capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you roll your eyes in disbelief, there&rsquo;s a major piece of evidence you need to know about. Samsung has registered three S10 devices with China&rsquo;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) already. While that doesn&rsquo;t 100% mean that the company plans to bring out all three at once, it does point to them having a lot up its sleeve.</p>

<h2>Watch This Space!</h2>
<p>While the rumour mill is churning away, there&rsquo;s one thing to keep in mind: Samsung has not released any official statement on the S10 or any other models.</p>
<p>That means that, right now, we simply have no concrete word on the matter. However, these snippets of gossip often have some weight to them and the fact that the company has already registered devices says a whole lot.</p>
<p>For now, unless any of you happen to have a crystal ball, we&rsquo;ll have to keep scratching our heads in wonder. Watch this space.</p>
