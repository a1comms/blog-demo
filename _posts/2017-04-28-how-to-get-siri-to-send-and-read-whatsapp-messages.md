<p>Sometimes, when your hands are busy, like when cooking or driving, reading and sending&nbsp;WhatsApp messages is a pain. What with the many groups you&rsquo;re in and the constant streams of conversation happening, it can be hard to keep up. But wait just a minute, what if someone (or, even, an AI) could manage your messages for you?</p>
<p>With the latest version of WhatsApp, that dream could soon be a reality. You see, the messaging service is now compatible with the likes of Siri. What that means is that you no longer have to open the app itself to read or send messages. Instead, you can just ask Siri (using voice command) to read them aloud, or compose away. It's genius.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know in order to get Siri reading and sending your WhatsApp messages for you.</p>
<h2>1) Download iOS 10.3</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13739 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iJR9iKSWwrG_70lEtrFfvip626SbNSz6mMfrqA62PTQb-26gJfM85Pmh6bUSC4ZRSLaqqtkcfCdzWXAN6t6fQw3v5Q=s0" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t updated your iPhone yet, what on earth have you been waiting for? You&rsquo;ll need to make sure that you have at least 50% battery life (or put your device on charge) and that you&rsquo;re connected to WiFi before you start. Next, you just need to go to <strong>Settings > General > Software Update </strong>and the whole thing will be done in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2>2) Get the Latest Version of WhatsApp</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13741" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xKuPQrBm31x3jZpfQzKv8Bdvb03A1iT-Oxsc_WTdIYLWVbcLMSMkSc76S6olLPojh76Ny0IIu7BV3gMUgbD-BQqw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When was the last time you updated your WhatsApp app? If you can&rsquo;t remember right now, it may be time to do something about it. You should know that Siri will only read your messages out if you have the latest version of WhatsApp. Head to <strong>App Store > Updates </strong>and then find the WhatsApp icon. Tap it to update and away you go!</p>
<h2>3) Give Siri Permission</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13742" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AHNrOjt4g0dI3l6tSribBhV0rOBmpP4c80xB1RoKHWhv5rL8BfA9itw4Ce9zreU99zYPvU3c6_McIWQRsa3KYOh3=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Right now, Siri doesn&rsquo;t actually have permission to read your WhatsApp messages. So, before you do anything else, you will need to sort that out ASAP. Luckily, it&rsquo;s very easy. Go to <strong>Settings > Siri > App Support </strong>and then toggle the WhatsApp option so that the two apps can work in sync with one another. Easy!</p>
<h2>4) Ask Siri to Start Reading</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13740" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uEWJPeHIG5fp7Y-gBtYaWSj6MXTauLTW4HixfZ6okAHxtlv3_ecl_MbhjaB4YzkVpqsEASiSqIJc4y8bRfUdg58QkA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, once you&rsquo;ve done all of the above, you can get started. Make sure you&rsquo;re in a place where you&rsquo;re comfortable having your messages read out, then open Siri and say the words &ldquo;Hey Siri, read my last WhatsApp message.&rdquo; The AI will read any unread messages and even ask you whether you want to respond by speaking a reply. Simple.</p>
