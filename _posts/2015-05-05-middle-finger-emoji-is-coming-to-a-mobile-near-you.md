<p><span class="postStandFirst">Microsoft is reportedly bringing the long-awaited middle finger emoji to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6658 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/oklpvz4nz1oq_small.png" alt="Middle Finger Emoji" width="650" height="197" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you often find yourself skimming through Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, only to be confronted with status, after tweet, after message of general vainglory and irritation.</p>
<p>But being the righteous person that you are, you&rsquo;re much too polite (and possibly afraid) to lower the tone with a written outburst of your true feelings. Sometimes, you just wish there was something a little simpler, and to the point.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you wish you could just give someone the digital equivalent of a middle finger&hellip;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blog.emojipedia.org/windows-10-emoji-changelog" target="_blank">Emojipedia</a>, Microsoft has plans to introduce just that, on its upcoming release of Windows 10. Support has apparently&nbsp;been added for the &ldquo;reversed hand with middle finger extended&rdquo; already, so we may see it arriving on desktops and mobiles alike sometime mid-2015.</p>
<p>You might find yourself slightly offended by the implications of the gesture, but certainly not by a lack of ethnic diversity. The middle finger emoji is set to arrive in an array of different skin tones, ranging from white to black, with a race-neutral grey option, too.</p>
<p>The middle finger was approved way back in 2014, however the likes of Apple and Google have yet to endorse this somewhat controversial emoji, as neither iOS nor Android currently features it. Whether they eventually will, or not, we cannot say.</p>
<p><strong>We can only hope.</strong></p>
