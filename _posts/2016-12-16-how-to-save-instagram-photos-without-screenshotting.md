<p>Have you ever been scrolling through Instagram when you catch something you want to save? Like a beautiful sunset or an inspiration quote.</p>
<p>"This would make the <em>perfect </em>phone background,&rdquo; you muse. &ldquo;How can I save it for myself on the sly?" We&rsquo;ve all been there. But the problem is, Instagram doesn't allow you to save other user&rsquo;s pictures. It's a total buzzkill.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12661" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/figuring-out-how-to-save-Insta-photos.jpg" alt="figuring-out-how-to-save-insta-photos" width="600" height="420" /></p>
<h2>Don't Just Screenshot</h2>
<p>Most people tend to opt for the makeshift, screenshotting option. They take a snapshot of the entire visible screen and then go through the pain of cropping it down to the right size later. The problem is, screenshotting risks degrading the photo quality! Eek.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to save a high-quality version of an Instagram picture, you now know that screenshotting is far from the best idea. Instead, you can save the original image, in all its glory, in just five simple steps.</p>
<p><strong>1) Open the image</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just view it as part of you feed, or it won&rsquo;t work. You actually have to click on the time stamp if you want to see the photo on its own. Once you have done that either on your phone or in Chrome, it&rsquo;s time to go ahead and save it.</p>
<p><strong>2) View the source</strong></p>
<p>Now, this all sounds rather technical, but trust us, it&rsquo;s not as hard as you may think. To view the source of the image, you just need to go to View > Developer > View Source. If you&rsquo;re doing all of this in a browser, you can right-click on the picture instead and select View Developer Source. It is honestly that simple!</p>
<p><strong>3) Find the URL</strong></p>
<p>OK, so what you should now see is a page of scary-looking code. Try not to panic. What you need to do is find the URL of the picture. Of course, you can do this manually by scanning the code for it, but there is an easier way. Just press &lsquo;Find&rsquo; and then try typing &lsquo;JPG&rsquo;. That will help you isolate the URL line quickly and easily as it will be the only line that ends in a JPEG format. Still with us?</p>
<p><strong>4) Copy and paste</strong></p>
<p>The URL will not be clickable, but you can copy and paste it into your browser (you can do this on both a mobile device or on a laptop!). Hit enter and wait for the page to load.</p>
<p><strong>5) Save the image! </strong></p>
<p>Finally, you can save the image simply by right-clicking it and pressing 'Save image', or holding down on it if you&rsquo;re using a mobile. This should take about two seconds and voila, you have the picture for life. In its original quality, too!</p>
