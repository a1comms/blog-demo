<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google has announced that Android Wear is now compatible with iOS devices, bringing more affordable smartwatches to iPhone users!</span></p>
<p>The advent of Android Wear marked the first time that one of the big three platform providers had made an operating system designed to run on smartwatches.</p>
<p>Although as you can imagine from the name, Wear smartwatches only worked with Android phones to being with...</p>
<p>That situation has now changed. According to the Official Google Blog, Android Wear will now work with iOS devices.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AndroidWear?src=hash">#AndroidWear</a> watches now work with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhones?src=hash">#iPhones</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wearwhatyouwant?src=hash">#wearwhatyouwant</a> http://t.co/BOM2XJ984g pic.twitter.com/ZuUixW4neI</p>

<p>Of course, we need to make one point: that statement only applies to new and <em>future</em> Android Wear watches.</p>
<p>LG Watch Urbane is the first Android Wear smartwatch that will work with iOS devices like iPhone 6 (and presumably the upcoming iPhone 6S), and all <em>future</em> Android Wear smartwatches, but existing do not support iOS.</p>
<p>Whether they will in future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It also needs to be noted that the iOS-compatible version will not have all the features to which users with Android phones (such as the new Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus) have access.</p>
<p>For instance, iOS users won&rsquo;t be able to reply to a text directly through their Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be able to search for songs in Apple&rsquo;s Music service either, or get access to the full range of third party apps on their Android Wear watch.</p>
<p>This will limit the ability to customise that watch, but it is worth noting that the Apple Watch doesn&rsquo;t allow any customisation via third party watch faces.</p>
<p>The biggest difference will be price, as Android Wear watches come in a lot cheaper than the Apple Watch. As such, Google may well pick up some new customers because of that, people who don&rsquo;t want to, or <em>can&rsquo;t</em>, pay that higher price for a watch.</p>
<p><strong>Still, more choice is always a good thing, and as of today, iOS users will finally have a lower-priced alternative to the Apple Watch.</strong></p>
