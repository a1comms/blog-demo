<p><span class="postStandFirst">WhatsApp Web, the web-based portal for the popular chat service, is now available to people who use iOS devices. Yes, you no longer need to envy your Android counterparts.</span></p>
<p>A few months ago, WhatsApp unveiled a new service for Android, Windows and BlackBerry users.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">WhatsApp Web</a>, it allows anyone using one of said platforms to access the popular chat client through a web browser, syncing up your conversations between your phone and your computer.</p>
<p>And now WhatsApp Web has been opened up for iOS users to have a play with, too. So, if you&rsquo;re using, say, an iPhone 6, then you can now chat to people on WhatsApp through your web browser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particularly valuable tool for office hours, as you can pretend you&rsquo;re working furiously on something, while in reality, you&rsquo;re catching up with friends.</p>
<p>So, how does it work? The process for using it is the same across both platforms.</p>
<p>First of all, you need an active WhatsApp account on your phone. Then, you need to go to <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/">web.whatsap.com</a> on your computer, and a QR code will pop up on the screen.</p>
<p>Simply go into WhatsApp on your phone, go to <strong>Menu > WhatsApp Web</strong>, scan that QR code, and then the messages on your phone will be synced to your browser, so you can chat on your computer.</p>
<p>Essentially, the browser version is a mirror of that on your mobile; all the messages remain on your phone, and you simply control the chats through your browser.</p>
<p>The upshot is that if your connection drops on your phone, you&rsquo;ll be disconnected from WhatsApp Web; because of that, and to avoid big data bills, it&rsquo;s best to have your phone connected through WiFi.</p>
<p><strong>So, have you been using WhatsApp on your iPhone, and wishing you could try out the web version? Well now you can, so give it a try! </strong></p>
