<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We think these have been sent back&nbsp;from the future.</span></p>
<p>Psst... The future is finally here. From robot butlers to electronic curtain rods, there&rsquo;s a whole host of cool, futuristic gadgets you can get your little mitts on these days. If it&rsquo;s about time you updated your home with some tech, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. We take a look at some of the wildest, weirdest gadgets of our time.</p>
<h2>1) The Sound Machine That Sends You to Sleep</h2>
