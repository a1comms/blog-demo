<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung is working on a new phone that further blurs the lines between phone and tablet, as it has a 7-inch screen, putting it firmly in the tablet size-class. In spite of the size, however, this mystery device has specs that appear to be a little underwhelming, and it&rsquo;s doubtful that it will have the same impact as phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or the flagship Samsung Galaxy S5.</span></p>
<p>Samsung pioneered a new genre of smartphones when they released the first Galaxy Note, a genre known as the &ldquo;phablet&rdquo;. Later, they took the phablet into the realm of 7-inch tablets, and now, it looks like they&rsquo;re about to try doing the latter once again with a Samsung 7-inch screen device.</p>
<p>According to PocketNow, China&rsquo;s&nbsp;Telecommunications Equipment Certification Center (also known as TENAA) has been testing a new Samsung phone, or perhaps it might better to describe it as a tablet, since this new device has a 7-inch screen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to make it even bigger than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, naturally, but it&rsquo;s not the first time a manufacturer has tried building phone functionality into a tablet-sized device; Asus tried it with the FonePad, and lest we forget, Samsung themselves have tried it before in the Galaxy Note 8.0.</p>
<p>The downside to such a big phone, of course, is that when you are using it as a phone, it tends to be what might be charitably called noticeable, or to put it another way, <em>you will have a 7-inch tablet held to your head</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, this new device isn&rsquo;t going to worry the likes of the aforementioned Galaxy Note 3, or smaller flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the HTC One M8. Its 7-inch screen only has a 720p resolution, and the quad-core processor only comes in at 1.2GHz, so it&rsquo;s doubtful that many people will want this as their main phone.</p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless, if it runs well, its &ldquo;uniqueness&rdquo; may see a few people take this new device into their hearts. That didn&rsquo;t really happen with the Galaxy note 8.0, but who knows, maybe it will be second time lucky? Stay tuned for more news. </strong></p>
