<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">2017 has been a massive year (already) for the likes of tech lovers. If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a brand new phone right now, there&rsquo;s a whole load of choice out there. But wait just a minute here, how on earth are you going to decide which device is right for you?</span></p>
<p>Well, if you happen to be stuck between the gorgeous Samsung Galaxy S8 and the slick LG G6, you may just have come to the right place. We&rsquo;ve pitted the two devices against one another to figure out which is on top. Stay tuned because here&rsquo;s just what we found.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>When it comes to the design, feel, and look of both of the phones, you really can&rsquo;t fault either Samsung or LG here. They&rsquo;ve both excelled with their flagship phones and there are a load of cool similarities here. For one thing, both devices are made of glass and metal combined. They are also both almost bezeless in design too, although the Samsung&rsquo;s screen <i>does </i>bend a little further around the phone than that of the LG.</p>
<p>The differences here are minor but may be deciding factors when it comes to choosing the right phone for you. In terms of size, Samsung has the slight upper hand, coming in at 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9mm, whereas the LG is a little smaller at 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm. They both weigh the exact same at just 163g. (Of course, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is a little larger than these scales!)</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned the look of both phones is fairly similar. You will notice a slight difference with the LG, though, since the designers have chosen to add a brushed aluminum style and a coat to the back of the phone. All that realistically does is ensure that the phone is less slippy and has a sturdier feel. You won&rsquo;t notice a massive difference between these devices, but it&rsquo;s well worth checking each of them out.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>As you likely already know, Samsung have sought to be the top of the charts when it comes to their display. This is quite clearly an area into which they&rsquo;ve plunged a great deal of their design time and resources. And, of course, it&rsquo;s paid off in an extreme way. Both the S8 and the S8 Plus have impressive super AMOLED displays and a 18.5:9 screen ratio. What&rsquo;s more, the so-called &lsquo;Infinity Screen&rsquo; feature means that the actual display is bigger than ever before.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the LG G6 is a little less advanced in this area. The 18:9 display ratio is decent enough and paired with the IPS LCD touchscreen, the look of the display is very good by all standards. Plus, if you&rsquo;re looking for an upgrade anytime soon, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that the LG devices also support the HDR10 system.</p>
<p>So, which phone is right for tech lovers? Well, if you&rsquo;re overly concerned about the quality of the display, opting for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is certainly the way to go. While the difference isn&rsquo;t particularly mind-blowing, it is noticeable and that may well be enough to make your decision for you.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get really interesting! Of course, since both handsets are new to the market, they will both have the much-awaited Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. Score. That&rsquo;s where the similarities between the LG and Samsung likely start and end, though. You see, there&rsquo;s a whole load of difference between the power these two phones are packing. Pay close attention here.</p>
<p>Samsung were, for a while, very secretive about the type of chipset they were using in both the S8 and S8 Plus. We now know that the devices come loaded with the Exynos 8895 (in the UK, anyway!), which just so happens to be one of the newest and most powerful chips on the market right now. The 10nm chip is one of the most impressive around, and so the system is sure to be quick and, yep, slick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that the LG G6 won&rsquo;t be fast. It will. The company have used the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset on the phone which too offers a whole lot of power. However, this is not a chip that&rsquo;s particularly new by any means. In the past, we&rsquo;ve seen it on Google devices and it&rsquo;s become a staple of modern tech. That means that the S8 may be a tad quicker than the G6, but the difference won&rsquo;t be major.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Of course, as you might expect with any flagship device, both the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are rather ahead of the game. Since security is a massive deal when it comes to modern-day tech, both have the somewhat essential fingerprint sensor on the back of the device. The only major difference here is the fact that the positioning of each sensor is slightly different.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to speak to your phone rather than, you know, use your hands, both of the devices have a dedicated AI. Packed onto the LG G6, you will find the renowned Google Assistant, which has had some relatively good reviews. Of course, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has Bixby; Samsung&rsquo;s own AI. You should find that each of these systems are relatively easy to use, which is sure to be a massive bonus.</p>
<p>But wait just a minute here, what about the camera? The two tech giants have always had decent enough snappers, so what have we got here. Here&rsquo;s where LG take centre stage, really, with a 13MP camera. Samsung have opted for a decent, but less powerful 12MP offering. What&rsquo;s more, the LG has a &lsquo;dual-lens&rsquo; camera, which we&rsquo;ve seen on many Android devices recently.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about two of the leading phones on the market right now, and so either of these devices would be ideal for the average user. Which you choose really does depend on what you happen to value in terms of technology.</p>
<p>If, for example, you&rsquo;re after a phone with a slick design and an awe-inspiring display to match, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is certain to be a good choice. If, on the other hand, you fancy an equally suave device with a high-powered camera, perhaps the LG G6 will suit you better. As always, it&rsquo;s well worth checking both of the devices out before you decide.</p>
