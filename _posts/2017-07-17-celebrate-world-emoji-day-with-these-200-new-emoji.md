<p>So, how can you celebrate this oh-so-exciting day? How about checking out what the future of the emoji world holds for you.</p>
<p>Later this year, there will be a full set of over 200 brand new emoji coming direct to your smartphone. Needless to say, there are many quirky icons we&rsquo;d all love to see&hellip; <em>did someone say espresso martini emoji?</em></p>
<p>Like most of us, you may already have a few emoji in mind that you&rsquo;re hoping for. But have they made the new list for 2017? Well, it&rsquo;s time to find out. Here&rsquo;s the full list of new emoji launching this year:</p>

<h2>New Emoji Themes</h2>
<p>As you can see from the list, there&rsquo;s quite an array of new emoji coming your way very soon. There's definitely a focus on food, clothing, emotions, and even fantasy creatures. The latter being our favourite, with vampires and even elves making the list. There&rsquo;s no doubt that sci-fi and fantasy lovers will welcome these new emoji.</p>
<h2>Inclusive Emoji</h2>
<p>More noteworthy, though, is the fact that there are some new, more inclusive emoji, featuring people from different backgrounds. For example, there&rsquo;s a woman wearing a headscarf, as well as gender-neutral faces. There&rsquo;s been some pressure to include more inclusive emoji, and it looks like they&rsquo;ll be available on the next update.</p>

<p>Sadly, these new emoji aren't yet available to start using in your messages. But good things come to those who wait, remember. We don't have a confirmed date yet, but we do know that all the new emoji featured above will be released this year in 2017. Until then, start thinking of creative ways you can use them all.</p>
