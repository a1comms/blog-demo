<p><span class="postStandFirst">What would happen if LG were to take the awesome LG G4, and shrink it down into a smaller, more affordable body? The result would be the rumoured LG G4c, which is said to be on its way...</span></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6729" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<img class="wp-image-6729 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/lg-g4-brown-leather_4.png" alt="LG G4" width="400" height="600" /> LG G4 in brown leather[/caption]</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s LG G3 was an amazing mobile phone, and this year&rsquo;s LG G4 is even better. You&rsquo;ll remember, we also saw a diluted version of the G3 last year in LG G3 S, aimed at tight budgets and even tighter pockets.</p>
<p>And wouldn't you know, it looks likely that we&rsquo;re going to see the same thing happen this year, according to <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http://winfuture.de/news,87004.html&amp;edit-text=" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> (Google-translated link).</p>
<p>According to the leaked details (as always, we treat these with a pinch of salt until LG comes out and confirms), the new budget counterpart to LG G4 is LG G4c, and it looks like it&rsquo;s essentially a refresh of LG G3 S, with a new body inspired by the svelte lines of the flagship G4.</p>
<p>However, the specs, as you might expect, are somewhat more modest than its big brother.</p>
<p>Instead of the Quad-HD screen and insanely powerful processor of LG G4, the G4c is rumoured to have a Snapdragon 410, and a 5-inch 720p screen. Both of those features will still be <em>brilliant</em>, of course, they just won&rsquo;t be as over-the-top magnificent as on the flagship variant.</p>
<p>Naturally, the camera will also be a more modest affair; it&rsquo;s rumoured to come in at 5MP, and it will lack the laser-focus of its big brother. Thus far, there&rsquo;s no word on whether it&rsquo;ll come clad in leather, like the G4, but we hope it does nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve said before that LG G4 is a <em>stunningly</em> nice phone, and if the G4c (if it is indeed happening) can capture some of that magic, it could prove to be one <em>brilliant</em> mid-ranger. Watch this space... </strong></p>
