<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Lets hope it's as tasty as the name, as Google confirms Android Oreo.</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we can expect from Android&rsquo;s latest update!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much speculation on what the latest Android update will be, we finally have the down low. And the winner is&hellip; Android Oreo! Nice name, guys. Seriously. Well done. If you can&rsquo;t wait to get your mitts on this update, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know and perhaps a little more:</span></p>

<h2>1) Super quick boot times</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major blessings that Oreo brings is a fast boot time. Usually, if you want your phone to be quicker, you have to upgrade the actual device. This update changes all of that. Every phone that runs the Android software should benefit from faster boot times right away. Now, that&rsquo;s sure to be a crowd-pleaser! </span></p>
<h2>2) Picture in Picture (PiP) mode</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;ve been following the news, you&rsquo;ve likely already heard the rumours about PiP mode. Well, they were all true. Once you upgrade your device to Android Oreo, you'll be able to start using this multitasking feature. Unlike the now old-school split window feature, PiP means that you can open a small window, which will be laid on top of the current page you&rsquo;re viewing. Nice.</span></p>

<h2>3) New icon features</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app icons are about to change in a seriously big way. With the release of Android Oreo, comes a whole new version of these little beauties. The main difference is that the icons will now be animated so when you tap them, they will move around a bit depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to do. The demo is out already, but we will have to wait to see how it works until the final release.</span><br />

<h2>4) Fewer background activities</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have seen this one coming. In a bid to save power, the latest Android update will mean that your phone has fewer things running in the background. The feature will de-prioritize apps that keep going when you&rsquo;re not using them. In theory, that should mean that you end up with a battery that lasts longer than before.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14751 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RmIZ-iB9ZxKddHWi3Ka1ObPDk86XNd8IMRiZ0Xiag3iI3k-Nsh9AhfOtBfqqZ6x-3bt0qfefiBzomMYshvBvCEeU0A=s0" alt="" width="600" height="225" /></p>
<h2>5) Brand new emojis</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re not exactly a fan of the blobby-style emojis on Android right now, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat. They will finally be a thing of the past. Phew! Google will be replacing the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirety </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of their emoji keyboard with a whole new style and look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s some rather intriguing news, especially for those of us who like to communicate in illustrations rather than words. What&rsquo;s more, there are some additions to the roster too including a giraffe, a wizard, and a mermaid. And, no, that&rsquo;s not the start of the world&rsquo;s worst joke!</span></p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14750 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lBGgUupuwWRhumHWyqT9Gns41oMB5BZjTzgfJBqlxOXbqQ2IZ6H0cTzbI6cGwCFY_wH86BChSXQEkLRmQeoJwVJ0=s0" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></h2>
<p><span class="" style="font-size: 23px; color: #444444;">NEXT: More amazing features and the release date.</span></p>

<h2>6) Notification dots</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&rsquo;s another feature that was rumoured and has now been confirmed. Rather than opening an app completely to see what notifications you have, you will be able to open a &lsquo;notification dot&rsquo; above the app icon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that you will get an at-a-glance rundown of what you&rsquo;ve missed without having to mess around too much. In short, it&rsquo;s a great addition to the Android interface. (Let&rsquo;s not forget, though, that iOS </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had this feature for what feels like an age and a half!)</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14748 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/txfMt3jveof3PI-Wts19Luh0m2G0i_w7-lwZfbhiG52vEDHqE5Bnq8Stu9AYcrxJb6o-keeWJXP9KQJpQvHIlioy=s0" alt="" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<h2>7) Better audio performance</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireless headphone owners, this one&rsquo;s for you! You may have been waiting for an upgrade that will help you use your fancy little gadgets with your phone. Well, here it is: LDAC is the latest offering to the audio world and it should make your listening experience a whole load better. It&rsquo;s Sony&rsquo;s hi-res Bluetooth audio codec and will help boost your Bluetooth audio functions. Yes!</span></p>
<h2>8) Easter egg mini game</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who want to get extra nerdy about Android Oreo, there&rsquo;s yet another Easter egg packed into this update. So, how do you get to it? Well, you simply need to hold onto the OS button for a few seconds. You will see a blank screen with nothing but an Octopus silhouette on it. Creepy, right? You can play around with this mysterious creature by dragging it with your finger and watching it jiggle around. Literally, minutes of fun.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14749 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z6UAISKluU71i42AVHGWRErJHL0lqup0bvx6hnI29PsvxN478XyyUJZ-yK8CV8FyAxl8aRWvF6slJPEkyc3aCi9I=s0" alt="" width="600" height="334" /></p>
<h2>9) Release date</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what Android has in store for you, let&rsquo;s get down to business. When can you upgrade your phone? If you have a Google-branded phone, you should have it very soon. It will come out in phases so watch out for your notification. Other Android users will have to wait a little longer. Right now, we don&rsquo;t know the official Android Oreo launch date for these devices, but it&rsquo;s sure to be soon too.</span></p>
