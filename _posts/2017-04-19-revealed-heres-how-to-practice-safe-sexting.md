<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here. Sexting is something that many of us <i>have </i>done or will do at some point. It&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of! Still, if you do want to send some saucy messages or pictures, you need to make sure you&rsquo;re 100% safe. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<h3>Never drink and sext!</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest for a moment here. When we&rsquo;ve had a few vinos, we&rsquo;re all a little braver (and sillier) than we are IRL. Drinking alcohol and then reaching for your phone to text that special someone might seem like no big deal, but it could quickly turn into a nightmare situation. The very last thing that you want to do is wake up the next morning with a killer hangover and a load of regrets.</p>
<p>Sexting is a sensitive topic for many reasons. One of the biggest is that it can be somewhat dangerous. Before you do it, you need to make sure that it&rsquo;s what you want to do and that you feel comfortable sharing texts or photos with the person you&rsquo;re messaging. You&rsquo;re in no place to make those decisions when you&rsquo;ve had too much to drink so just put the phone down.</p>
<h3>Make sure that you <i>both </i>consent</h3>
<p>Before you hit that all important &lsquo;send&rsquo; button, make sure that it&rsquo;s what you both want. Unwarranted nude pictures are not only a plague but they can also be a form of harassment. Taking that step is a massive deal and you need to make sure that you&rsquo;re both on the same page before you do it. Talk to your partner and be certain that it&rsquo;s what you both want so that you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re both happy.</p>
<p><b>Warning: </b>If you&rsquo;re under the age of 18, sending nude pictures of yourself to anyone is actually illegal according to UK law. It counts as distributing indecent imagery of a child (even if said child is you). That means that you could end up with a criminal record or even on the sex offenders register.</p>
<h3>Delete the metadata before you send photos</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re of legal age and have decided that you <i>do </i>want to send nude images to your partner, there are some things you can do to protect yourself. For example, you can avoid showing your face in the pictures. That way, no one will be able to tell that the picture is you should it get out. Phew.</p>
<p>You should also delete the metadata before you send the image. Once you&rsquo;ve taken the picture, it will be tagged with certain information. For example, by looking at the picture details, a person can see your location, the date the image was taken, and the type of device you used. Scary stuff! To get rid of this info, you can use an app, such as EXIF Stripper, which will delete the metadata in seconds, making the picture safe to send.</p>
<h3>Beware of linked devices!</h3>
<p>Finally, you have to be aware of linked devices that work in sync with your phone. For example, if you happen to have an iPhone and an iPad, your iMessages will likely send to both devices. That means that if someone is using your iPad while you&rsquo;re sexting on your iPhone, they might get a somewhat nasty surprise! Yikes.</p>
<p>So, what should you do? Well, to avoid just this issue, you need to make sure that you use a secure device that is <i>not </i>linked to any other gadgets. You can use the traditional &lsquo;text message&rsquo; function on your phone which shouldn&rsquo;t be linked to anything else. Alternately, you could unlink your device from other gadgets before you sext. Easy!</p>
