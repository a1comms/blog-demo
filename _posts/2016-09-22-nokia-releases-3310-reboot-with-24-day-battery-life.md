<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Nokia 216 out-beasts even the 3310&rsquo;s battery&hellip; Is this the brick the nostalgics have been waiting for?</span></p>
<p>Nokia&rsquo;s new retro phone carries us back to the good old days. The days when you could take your mobile out with you on a Friday night, inexplicably end up on a weekend bender full of hazy regret and high scores on Snake, arriving home Monday evening just in time for tea, and still have 99% battery left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Nokia 216, and it&rsquo;s a fresh take on Nokia&rsquo;s classic models from the 00s. Updated with a colour display, app support for Facebook, and, wait for it, a <em>24-day battery life</em>, this is very much a Nokia 3310 on steroids. Of course, it isn&rsquo;t quite the same indestructible force of nature, but then again, what is?</p>

<p>Nokia 216 is evidently better looking than the icons of days gone by, yet it&rsquo;s still noticeably Nokia. It even comes in a shade of turquoise that&rsquo;s heart-warmingly reminiscent of my old Nokia 3410. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not in any sort of rush to trade my iPhone in, but I can&rsquo;t help but want one of these, even if it&rsquo;s just for a fill of nostalgia.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that Nokia 216 isn&rsquo;t trying to be anything more than a simple feature phone, sitting merrily in the lower end of the market with a 0.3MP camera and 2.4-inch display. But in an age where iris scanners and heart rate monitors are becoming standard on smartphones, it&rsquo;s sort of endearing to see a new mobile phone that&rsquo;s just like our old mobile phones. Just a little more current. And a little more sentimental.</p>
