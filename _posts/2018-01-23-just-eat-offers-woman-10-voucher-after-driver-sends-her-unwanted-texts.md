<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&ldquo;See you next time when I get your meal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When ordering a takeaway, few of us expect it to come with a complimentary side of creepy, unsolicited text messages. Sadly, though, that&rsquo;s just what happened to Michelle Midwinter when she recently ordered food via the Just Eat app.</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving her meal, the delivery man who had come to her home started sending her personal texts. In these messages, he began calling her &lsquo;bby&rsquo; (sic) and saying that he was &lsquo;a fan&rsquo; of her. Needless to say, Midwinter was shocked by the nature of the messages and soon got in touch with Just Eat about the issue.</p>
<p>On receiving the complaint, Just Eat said that the messages were &lsquo;appalling&rsquo; and offered her a &pound;5 goodwill voucher as compensation for the &lsquo;inconvenience&rsquo; that Midwinter had suffered. However, after Midwinter replied saying that it was not an &lsquo;inconvenience&rsquo; but &lsquo;outrageous and disgusting&rsquo; behaviour, the company increased the voucher offer to &pound;10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all honesty, we don&rsquo;t have a complaints department. We do documentation on the account and take note of everything,&rdquo; read the message that Midwinter put up on Twitter alongside the original messages she had received from the delivery driver.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just a snippet of Just Eat&rsquo;s response to my receiving unsolicited messages from the guy who had just delivered my food. Nice one Just Eat! Apart from him using my number in this way surely being in breach of privacy laws etc, they don&rsquo;t really seem to take it seriously do they?? <a href="https://t.co/OVZkl0IW5f">pic.twitter.com/OVZkl0IW5f</a></p>

<p>The original messages show the driver starting a WhatsApp chat with Midwinter after delivering her meal. During the course of the chat, he asks whether she has a boyfriend because he doesn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;make problems&rsquo; for her. At the end of the conversation, he says bye to her by writing "good night bby (sic) see you next time when I get your meal.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ooh here&rsquo;s a good one! <a href="https://t.co/R49sYNni8d">pic.twitter.com/R49sYNni8d</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Midwinter later went on to share more of the conversation via Twitter after other users asked for evidence of the alleged harassment. In these messages, the delivery driver explained that he got her number when he delivered her food and apologised. He also said that he&rsquo;d be there for her if she wants to speak to him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scary thing is the sheer number of females who have had similar experiences - a few with Just Eat, but generally this issue is much bigger and more widespread than I initially anticipated,&rdquo; Midwinter said in a statement given to Newsbeat. "We trust companies with our personal details and for them to be used in this way is unacceptable."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">That escalated quickly. I am astounded by the amount of females who have contacted me saying a similar thing happened to them. This is no longer about my personal experience, this is about privacy law and safeguarding females. This is clearly a huge problem and it needs to stop <a href="https://t.co/m9uObXFjYc">https://t.co/m9uObXFjYc</a></p>

<p>And it seems that Midwinter is not alone in her shocking experience. She also took to Twitter once more to say how &lsquo;astounded&rsquo; she had been by the number of women who had got in touch with her to say that they&rsquo;d had similar experiences. &ldquo;This is no longer about my personal experience, this is about privacy law and safeguarding females,&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;This is clearly a huge problem and it needs to stop.&rdquo;</p>
