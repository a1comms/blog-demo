<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">High-end feel, mid-range prices!</span></p>
<p>The annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is in full swing and there have already been some surprises along the way.</p>
<p>Sony hasn't disappointed us this time around, announcing the launch of some fantastic-looking devices. Two such smartphones are the mid-range Sony Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus models.</p>
<p>So, what do we know so far about the brand-new devices?</p>

<h2>Widescreen Video Feature</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re looking at mid-range devices, you might not expect the displays to be top-of-the-range.</p>
<p>However, Sony has really pulled it out of the bag when it comes to the Sony Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus. The former has a whopping 6-inch Wide Full HD+ display, with 21:9 aspect ratio, making it a super-tall screen. The latter, taking things up another level, offers a massive 6.5-inch display with the same specs.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio basically means that you can watch videos in widescreen. It&rsquo;s pretty much like having a (personal) cinema screen in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>That cool feature will certainly upgrade your overall experience when watching a movie or binging Netflix on your Xperia phone. It&rsquo;s a huge selling point.</p>

<h2>Simplistic Design</h2>
<p>The look of the Sony Xperia 10 and 10 Plus is entirely understated &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>On the front, each phone is mostly screen, with a bezel ridge across the top. There&rsquo;s no home button, either, which means that it&rsquo;s a truly minimalist design. The fingerprint scanner is actually on the right side of the phone, next to the power button.</p>
<p>The rear consists of a metal casing while there&rsquo;s Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the front. Both of the phones come in four colours &ndash;&nbsp;Navy, Black, Silver, and Gold &ndash;&nbsp;each of which is quite low-key.</p>

<h2>Super-Quick Running</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most notable things about the new phones, according to the latest Xperia 10 and 10 Plus reviews, is their speed.</p>
<p>Each device sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 chipset. That means that the devices should be extremely quick, especially when it comes to multitasking. Given that these are not the flagship Sony devices, that in itself is quite impressive. Usually, you wouldn&rsquo;t get quiet that level of power with a more affordable handset, like these are.</p>
<p>Although, not as rapid as the Qulacomm Snapdragon 845 processor found on top-end devices, these handsets still pack plenty of power for most users.</p>
<h2>Other Xperia Features</h2>
<p>When it comes to the cameras, there&rsquo;s a decent enough offering.</p>
<p>Both devices have a dual camera setup on the rear&ndash;&nbsp;the Xperia 10 boasts a 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel combo, while the 10 Plus has a 12-megapixel and 8-megapixel.</p>
<p>The smartphones each have an accelerometer, barometer, gyro sensor, compass and HR sensor. There&rsquo;s also the split screen display, which means that you can use two apps at the same time.</p>
<h2>Super-Affordable Smartphones</h2>
<p>So, how much will these phones set you back? The cost is one of the best parts of these devices.</p>
<p>The standard Xperia 10 starts at &pound;299 while the Xperia 10 Plus is &pound;349. Compared to flagship devices, these are seriously affordable, which is certain to draw a load of savvy buyers to them. Yep, if you&rsquo;re looking for a real bargain, you might have found it.</p>
