<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Could we see another world beater from Huawei in 2018?</span></p>
<p>There are rumours flying in the airwaves that we could see more Huawei releases in 2018. Could this be the next Huawei Mate series that will be announced? Here&rsquo;s what we know so far.</p>
<h2>Huawei Mate 20: &ldquo;The Name&rsquo;s Huawei, Mate&hellip;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that these next Mate series smartphones have yet to be officially named, but <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-20-pro-891226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sources</a> suggest this is the most likely choice. So, from here we&rsquo;ll be referring to the next handsets as Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Mate 20 and Mate 20 Lite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thought Huawei is unlikely to go with Mate 11 (following on from Mate 10) in the next update, partly down the fact that Huawei mate the same move with the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/huawei-p20-p20-pro-and-p20-lite-heres-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20 family earlier this year</a>.</p>
<h2>Huawei Mate 20: Design and Display</h2>
<p>It looks like we might be in for a real treat in the screen department. These rumoured handsets are expected to boast bigger and better screens than the Mate 10.</p>
<p>Huawei Mate 20 Pro is rumoured to sport a huge 6.9-inch display, making it the largest smartphone screen on the UK market! The Mate 20 is said to come with a 6.3-inch display, while the Mate 20 Lite handset is expected to maintain a notch, just like the P20 Lite release, according to leaker, Evan Blass.</p>

<p>This Mate 20 render leaked from XDA developers suggests we might see a so-called water-drop notch design on a device. This is another step towards an all screen smartphone.</p>

<h2>Huawei Mate 20: Cameras</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s rumoured that we could also see more camera improvements, too. The Mate 20 Pro could sport a 42-megapixel triple camera setup, according to <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-pro-lite-3486661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trusted Reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Huawei Mate 20, the mid-range handset, is rumoured to feature a camera with at least 20-megapixels.</p>
<p>While the third handset, Mate 20 Lite, is said by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-20-pro-891226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Authority</a> to feature a dual main camera comprised of 20- and 2-megapixel lenses, along with a hefty 24- and 2-megapixel selfie cam.</p>

<h2>Huawei Mate 20: Other Features</h2>
<p>Supposedly boasting brand-new chipset technology, the new Mate series will no doubt be super-fast and efficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said that Android 9.0 Pie could also be on the new phones for launch. Huawei&rsquo;s EMUI skin overlay, of course, will more than likely be present too.</p>
<p>According to Trusted Reviews, Mate 20 Pro will feature an in-screen fingerprint reader, 6GB RAM and fast-charging. "Mobile Leaks Visualiser and Concept Designer", Ben Geskin, released these images, suggesting we might even see a face unlock feature on two of the Mate devices, as well as a quad main camera!</p>

<p>Huawei Mate 20 could feature a large 4200 mAh battery, wireless charging and a variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. Similarly, the Mate 20 Lite should have 6GB RAM, a slightly smaller 3650 mAh battery and 64GB storage. There&rsquo;re some pretty impressive specs on offer here, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that, but when can we expect to see them?</p>
<h2>Huawei Mate 20: Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>The annual IFA conference in Berlin is being held between August 31<sup>ST</sup> &ndash; September 5<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>2018, where Huawei is taking to the stage to announce its latest tech. It was here that it confirmed the announcement date for the Mate 20 smartphone!</p>

<p>Huawei Mate 10 was released in October 2017 and as thought, the 2018 models will follow suit. We look forward to getting a first proper look at these handsets this October.</p>
