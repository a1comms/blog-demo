<p><span class="postStandFirst">With the world gearing up to receive the new HTC One with open arms, we take a look at the company that is 'quietly brilliant' and what makes it so special. This is the&nbsp;history of HTC...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.technologytell.com/gadgets/files/2012/01/HTC-logo.jpg" width="614" height="391" />Founded in 1997, HTC was initially a manufacturer for notebook computers. It began designing some of the world&rsquo;s first touchscreen devices in 1998 and has many &lsquo;firsts' to its name, including the first Microsoft-powered smartphone and of course the first Android-powered smartphone, the HTC G1.</p>
<p>Some other firsts claimed by the Taiwanese firm have included the launching of the HTC Evo 4G, the first 4G handset to launch in the United States, and it also launched the world&rsquo;s first full 1080p screened phones with the HTC Butterfly and Droid DNA. Just to add one more string to its bow HTC was the first manufacturer to pair up with Google to create the award winning NEXUS ONE back in 2010.</p>
<p>HTC acquired a 51% share of&nbsp;BEATS&nbsp;Electronics in August 2011 allowing it to include both the technology and&nbsp;branding of BEATS in the handsets produced since November of that year.</p>
<p>Its latest handset, the&nbsp;HTC One, is causing ripples in the smartphone world with its innovative camera, advanced software and a design to die for. However this is not the first time that one of HTC's products has invoked a stir in the mobile phone industry.</p>
<p>Past triumphs from HTC have included award-winners such as the forefather of Android the G1, NEXUS ONE, the Desire range and 2012's&nbsp;HTC One X.</p>
<p>Without all the designs and technical innovations from its predecessors, the creation of the HTC One would not have been possible.</p>
<p><strong>HTC is a company which is always trying to think outside-the-box by bringing exciting new ideas to the table and, for a company which is 'quietly brilliant' it sure can make some noise!</strong></p>
