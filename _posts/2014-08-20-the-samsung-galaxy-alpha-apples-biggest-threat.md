<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has unveiled its newest smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, and looking at its sleek design and metal frame, we think that Apple has some serious completion on its hands. That&rsquo;s what we like to see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">&nbsp;<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4921" alt="Samsung Galaxy Alpha" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/04_SM-G850F_013_white-1024x682.jpg" width="960" height="639" /><span class="caption">Image: Samsung Galaxy Alpha, courtesy of samsungmobilepress.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">It&rsquo;s always interesting to watch things unfold when a manufacturer designs a smartphone that feels like it&rsquo;s designed <i>specifically</i> to take on only one or two other phones. Those with good memories might remember the Palm Pre, which was billed specifically as an &lsquo;iPhone Killer&rsquo;. Did it fulfil its duty? No, not really.</p>
<p>However, it looks like there might be <i>another</i> &lsquo;iPhone Killer&rsquo; on the way, but this time, it&rsquo;s coming from a much bigger and more popular manufacturer &ndash; Samsung.</p>
<p>The phone in question is the recently announced Samsung Galaxy Alpha, and one of the most noticeable things about it is that it doesn&rsquo;t follow the traditional design aesthetic of Samsung&rsquo;s other flagship phones in quite the same way. If you were to compare it to the Samsung Galaxy S5, for example, you&rsquo;ll see what we&rsquo;re alluding to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4752" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G900F_shimmery-WHITE_02-1005x1024.jpg" width="960" height="978" /><span class="caption">Image: Samsung Galaxy S5, courtesy of samsungmobilepress.com</span></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Alpha sports a metal band and chamfered edges, rather than the all-plastic design we&rsquo;re used to seeing from Samsung. You could easily compare the new, sleek design to the iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>However, what makes this a serious competitor to the iPhone is the 4.7-inch 720p screen. That is a small step down from the Samsung Galaxy S5&rsquo;s display (and one or two more from the LG G3, for example), but it suits the device perfectly if you consider that Samsung is trying to outshine the size and quality of the iPhone 5s&rsquo; screen, which measures in at 4-inches.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4811" alt="iphone 5s" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/wireless_hero-1024x577.jpg" width="960" height="540" /><span class="caption">Image: iPhone 5s, courtesy of apple.com</span></p>
<p>At 4.7-inches, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha may end up sporting exactly the same size display as the fabled iPhone 6, which would appear to be an intentional move by Samsung. In other words, it looks as though Apple and Samsung are going to have a healthy bit of competition next month, when all is revealed.</p>
<p>Of course, the specs of the Samsung Galaxy Alpha are very impressive too, with the aforementioned HD screen, a 12MP camera (with a ton of extra features such as HDR and &ldquo;Beauty Face&rdquo;), and an octa-core processor (two quad-core processors bolted together, effectively, one at 1.8GHz and one at 1.3GHz).</p>
<p>Whilst they are fantastic specs, we can&rsquo;t help but feel that the main focus here is the design. Samsung has dubbed it its &lsquo;sleekest Samsung Galaxy smartphone ever&rsquo;, and do you know what, we completely agree. It&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>At the moment, there&rsquo;s no concrete information about when the Samsung Galaxy Alpha will officially go on sale, but all things considered, we&rsquo;d bet that the actual launch date would be around the launch of the iPhone 6. Watch this space for more news.</strong></p>
