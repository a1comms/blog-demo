<p><span class="postStandFirst">LG has announced the LG G3 Stylus, a phone best described (as the name suggests) as a cheaper version of the LG G3, with a stylus. With distinctly mid-range specs (and presumably, a price to match), this could prove perfect for people who want a <i>budget</i> big-screen phone.</span></p>

<p>Whenever a top-end superphone, like the LG G3, is launched, you can be relatively certain that as time goes on, more variants of that phone will be unveiled with a variety of different specs, in an effort to target different demographics.</p>
<p>And so, when the LG G3 was unveiled, it became a simple matter of time until other variants of that proficient and powerful flagship started emerging. We&rsquo;ve seen the LG G3 S, and now, according to the LG Newsroom, it&rsquo;s time for the LG G3 Stylus to take to the stage.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the most accurate way to describe it is as &ldquo;an LG G3 with a stylus&rdquo;, although really, we need to add an extra word in there, and call it &ldquo;a <i>cheaper</i> LG G3 with a stylus&rdquo;. As it turns out, this phone is a distinctly mid-range affair, so while the Samsung-baiting stylus <i>may</i> give the impression that it will try to take on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the truth is that it&rsquo;s aimed at people who want a more budget-friendly phablet.</p>
<p>As such, the 5.5-inch screen has a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels, which is far below the <i>immense</i> resolution on the LG G3 or even phones with 1080p screens, like the Samsung Galaxy S5. It&rsquo;s also marginally lower than the 720p screen on the Motorola Moto G 4G, so we can say with absolute certainty that this is definitely a mid-range phone. The processor, a quad-core chip clocked to 1.3GHz, reinforces that view.</p>
<p><strong>However, if the LG G3 Stylus can capture even half of the buzz that greeted the original LG G3, LG could be onto a winner here. We shall take a closer look at this phone as soon as we can get our hands on one, so stay tuned for more news.&nbsp;</strong></p>
