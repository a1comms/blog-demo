<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">If you love geeky games and discovering secret Easter eggs, this is for you.</span></p>
<p>Looking for a little #MondayMotivation? We hear you. To mark the worst day of the week, we&rsquo;ve got a little treat in store for you. How about a quick coffee break and a game? Here&rsquo;s a great little Easter egg brought to you from the good folk at Google. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>How to Find the Secret Adventure Game</h2>
<p>Before you do anything else, you will need to make sure that you are using the right browser. Sorry, Safari fans&hellip; This hidden Easter egg is only available in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.</p>
<p>Download one of the above, if you don&rsquo;t already have any of them, and get started. Open your browser and head to a little-known site called Google.co.uk.</p>
<p>Next, you simply need to type in the words &lsquo;text adventure&rsquo; and search. Right click anywhere on the page and you should see a drop-down menu. Click on the word &lsquo;inspect&rsquo; and it will bring up a whole new box appear somewhere on your screen &ndash; either to the right-hand side or at the bottom.</p>
<p>Click the &lsquo;console&rsquo; tab at the top of the box and you will see a cheeky little message that says, &lsquo;Would you like to play a game?&rsquo; In your wisdom, you reply, yes, to get started.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19033" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gTWuBCKjGBqXGhs_Fc6gCkvj44SrmN2yIC90XX_aqMbmUwcXm7NgsAu3sYownsYRzhK53xDALDVgXeuc3rJaNI8UIA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>How to Control the Game</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t a Saw situation. (Phew!) The game you&rsquo;re about to play is less horrific and geekier than you could imagine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever played a text adventure before now, you won&rsquo;t need a rundown of how this game goes. For the rest of us, though, here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>You read the storyline in text form and control your character by writing commands</li>
<li>Typical commands include &lsquo;north,&rsquo; &lsquo;south,&rsquo; &lsquo;east,&rsquo; and &lsquo;west&rsquo; for directions and &lsquo;use&rsquo; and &lsquo;grab&rsquo; for actions</li>
<li>Walk your way through the world and find various clues and hints</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you know the basics, you should find it relatively easy to get started when it comes to playing the game. The idea is that you go around Google&rsquo;s virtual campus and find the letters that make up the company&rsquo;s brand name.</p>
<p><em>Spoiler: That makes it sound way easier than it is. You might just find that you lose hours of your life trying to crack it!</em></p>
