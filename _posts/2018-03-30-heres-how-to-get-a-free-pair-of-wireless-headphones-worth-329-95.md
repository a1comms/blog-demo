<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Free Bose wireless headphones? Yes please.</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; We&rsquo;ve seen the future, and it&rsquo;s wireless. This Bluetooth headphone trend isn&rsquo;t going away anytime soon, and so it may be time to get on board.</p>
<p>Of course, with so many wireless headphones options out there, you may not know where to start. What&rsquo;s more, many of the high-end headphones just don&rsquo;t come cheap.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have the answer for you. Here&rsquo;s how you can get a free pair of wireless headphones worth &pound;329.95 for the low, low price of <em>nothing at all.</em></p>
<h2>Introducing... the QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II</h2>
<p>While there are lots of headphones on the market, Bose&rsquo;s offering of the <a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II</a> are some of the best you can get. Not only are these beauties noise-cancelling, but they also have Google Assistant built into them. Yes, this is like having your very own personal assistant in your ears at all times.</p>

<p>That rather futuristic tech means that you can listen to music, hear phone calls and texts, and get questions answered at the touch of a button. Rather than having to pull your phone out of your bag or pocket, you can just ask Google whatever you need through your headphones. It&rsquo;s basically a spy gadget.</p>
<h2>Pre-order Huawei P20 or P20 Pro to Get the Deal</h2>
<p>Huawei has just added some new devices to its already popular P-series of phones.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20 Pro</a> mark a new era for the heavyweight company, complete with a brand new, minimal design, and an almost bezeless display. They also come packed with some incredible AI features, top-notch cameras, and Android Oreo. In short, they&rsquo;re pretty neat phones.</p>
