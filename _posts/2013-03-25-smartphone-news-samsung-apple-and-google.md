<h2>Apple iPhone 5s</h2>
<p>According to sources the next iPhone, rumoured to be the iPhone 5s, will allegedly be a marginal upgrade of the iPhone 5, coming with an improved processor, and potentially a higher megapixel camera featuring a new module, or even a redesigned flash with white and yellow LEDs in order to improve colour reproduction.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini</h2>
<p>Word has it that Samsung is planning to release a mini version of the upcoming flagship the Galaxy S4.</p>

<p>It is said to sport a dual-core processor, clocked at 1.6ghz, a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED display of qHD resolution and is expected to be shipping with Android Jellybean 4.2.2 straight from the box.</p>
<p>An official announcement is expected in summer this year.</p>
