<p><span class="postStandFirst">Have you bought yourself an iPhone recently? Then our 5 top tips for your new iPhone, ranging from using iTunes to having a conversation with Siri, and beyond, will help you to start getting the most out of your device.</span></p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve joined millions of people all round the world, and bought yourself one of the most popular devices in mobile history. You&rsquo;re all set, then: you&rsquo;ve got your <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/apple?adnetwork=fcbk">new iPhone</a>, and now it&rsquo;s time to see exactly what it can do!</p>
<p>Of course, long-time fans of Apple will tell you that there&rsquo;s nothing an iPhone can&rsquo;t do, but while that&rsquo;s not <em>strictly</em> true, there&rsquo;s a whole ton of cool stuff to play about with in your new phone.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve gone for the metal-bodied, 64-bit<strong> iPhone 5s</strong>, or the most budget-friendly, polycarbonate-shelled<strong> iPhone 5c</strong>, here&rsquo;s 5 top tips for your new iPhone to get you started.</p>
<h2>1) Marvel at the pseudo-3D effect on wallpapers and icons</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/13775075834_9da0e7b423.jpg" alt="iPhone top tips" width="500" height="293" /></p>
<p>Apple added an awful lot of new stuff into iOS 7, but one of the most immediately apparent changes was what they did to the interface. Gone are the gradients and faux-real-thing touches of previous versions, replaced by a new, more modern &ldquo;flat&rdquo; look, with solid colours and clearly defined shapes.</p>
<p>And yes, those shapes <em>move</em> when you tilt the phone, to simulate parallax and make it look like you&rsquo;re viewing a 3D space not a flat screen. It&rsquo;s a simple little effect, but it&rsquo;s one that will immediately catch your eye.</p>
<h2>2) Get on iTunes, buy music, be happy</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7057/13774814083_104035029c.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="335" /></p>
<p><em>Everyone</em> loves music, and with your new iPhone, you now have access to perhaps the most well-known music store in the history of everything ever: iTunes. While it began life as the music store for the iPod range of mp3 players, iTunes has gone on to become one of the core features of the iPhone, giving you access to a <em>vast</em> swathe of music and podcasts, all from within your device.</p>
<h2>3) Go onto the App Store, emerge 3 hours later with a much fuller phone</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3714/13123463484_277b6a95d7.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Alongside iTunes, Apple&rsquo;s <em>other</em> big store is, of course, the App Store. Once you access the App Store, you&rsquo;re very likely to do what <em>everyone</em> does when they get a new iPhone: emerge several hours later, with a huge grin on your face and a <em>much</em> fuller phone.</p>
<p><em>Angry Birds</em> may factor in there somewhere, as well, but don&rsquo;t worry, because that&rsquo;s perfectly normal.</p>
<h2>4) Realise you&rsquo;re having an actual conversation with Siri</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/13774861825_8f1dcfd56c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="271" /></p>
<p>One of the most famous parts of the whole iPhone experience is, of course, the virtual assistant known to the world as Siri. Siri just keeps on getting smarter with every iteration, and there&rsquo;s an odds-on chance that in addition to having her run searches for you, you <em>will</em> end up actually having a conversation with her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those things that no-one seems to be able to resist doing.</p>
<h2>5) Marvel at how <em>easy</em> everything is to use</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3740/9717045921_d6cde37180.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="164" /></span></strong></p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that gets talked about a lot, it&rsquo;s how <em>incredibly</em> easy an iPhone is to use. The whole experience is remarkably intuitive, which is quite possibly why the iPhone has found immense popularity with people who might not have used smartphones before.</p>
<h2>Bonus top tip: argue with someone who uses an Android phone</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/12325849164_eee5313696_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></p>
<p>Do you know someone who uses an Android phone like the upcoming HTC One M8 or <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>? Then you <em>will</em> argue with them about which phone is better. It&rsquo;s a law of nature at this stage. Just try not to break the furniture, okay?</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a lot more stuff waiting to be found in your new iPhone, so jump on in with these top tips, and get settled down to life with your new phone. </strong></p>
