<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We'll see your selfie stick, and we'll raise you a selfie drone.</span></p>
<p>Love them or loathe them, the truth is we all take them. Yes, the humble selfie has become so much more than a mere picture; it&rsquo;s a statement in itself.</p>
<p>The moment you pout your lips and push that button, you&rsquo;re showing the world just what you want them to see. You&rsquo;re branding yourself as best you know how, and making sure that you get the perfect shot every single time. You could say it&rsquo;s an art.</p>

<p>Capturing your best side is sometimes easier said than done, though. When it comes to taking a selfie, there&rsquo;s more to it than a press of a button.</p>
<p>In reality, the logistics of holding your phone upright and trying to press capture with the same hand are messy. And often result in less than ideal results. If that sounds all-too-familiar, you need to hear about this next product: the AirSelfie Drone.</p>

<p>Move along selfie sticks, because this could well be the future of vanity pictures as we know them. This selfie drone syncs up to your phone, and you can steer it in the air, getting it in position for the perfect angle every time.</p>
<p>The selfie drone can reach heights of around 20 metres in the air, which means that you can get a super-far away snap (they&rsquo;re more flattering), should you want one. From bird&rsquo;s eye views to aerial shots, there are few things that this drone cannot do.</p>
<p>The AirSelfie compatible app is available for both iOS and Android users, which means that most mobile phones can use this selfie drone. There&rsquo;s an autonomous hovering mode, which is certain to be useful as well as the ability to adjust the height and direction of the drone.</p>

<p>When it comes to landing the drone, AirSelfie suggests either directing it to your open palm or grabbing it while it&rsquo;s in the air. What&rsquo;s more, it comes with a protective case, which actually doubles as a charger for the device. It all sounds pretty space-age, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how and, of course, where you can nab the AirSelfie drone. The gadget comes with a hefty price tag at $295 (around the &pound;220-mark), but can you really put a price on the perfect selfie? You can <a href="http://www.airselfiecamera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order it online via the AirSelfie site</a>, which luckily ships all around the world.</p>
