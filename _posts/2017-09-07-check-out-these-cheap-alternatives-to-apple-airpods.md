<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Stylish, wireless earbuds on a budget!</span></p>
<p>Try as you might, there&rsquo;s just no resisting the wireless headphone and earbud trend. Let&rsquo;s face it, not having to worry about plugging your earphones into your phone is a lifesaver.</p>
<p>You just pop them in your ears, switch on the Bluetooth, select a song or quippy podcast and get going. It&rsquo;s so simple that it makes wired earphones look like a mere relic of the past. And maybe they are...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14912" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KRTX69nckrwsml-oGE2N0M4RyENPPpzzjitNr6aB76vDA-dujkQZZQh32FElZOpPld4q9tZPUd96Zd9y9ugVMgVMbQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Still, if your budget is a little tight right now, you may be in a bit of a pickle. The price tag of some of the higher range models can be quite hefty. While they are no doubt worth the cash, not everyone can realistically part with that much money in one splurge. Luckily, there&rsquo;s one simple way to save.</p>
<p>Say hello to the HBQ True Wireless Earbuds! These little beauties look very similar to the likes of the Apple AirPods, and yet they're so cheap. In theory, these wireless earphones can do pretty much everything that the best on the market can, but will cost you a whole lot less. So what do you get for your money here?</p>

<h2>HBQ True Wireless Features</h2>
<p>The True Wireless Earbuds come with built-in Bluetooth (of course!), which means that they can connect to most every device that has this feature. The description also claims that they have a comfortable and secure fit with an &lsquo;ergonomic&rsquo; design.</p>

<p>So, the idea is that the buds should sit neatly in your ears and never once fall out. Great news for fitness freaks who want to take them jogging! Phew.</p>
<h2>HBQ True Wireless Charging</h2>
<p>Charging can often be an issue with wireless products, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what we have here. The earbuds come with a portable charging case, which they can sit in as they get some power. (What&rsquo;s more, the whole thing looks very sleek and snazzy!)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14910" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzLCTTVQeG0I63lU19r6dPpWDHt8iR_TZY6fQgSnljZv2NYzEyw8npYEjeiOwJtKCgU4J5J7tP6CC1zpzcja0Q=s0" alt="" width="600" height="479" /></p>
<p>They take two hours maximum to charge, which gives you between three and four hours &lsquo;play time&rsquo;. What that means is that you shouldn't be charging these things overnight, but popping them into the case for an hour or so now and then.</p>
<h2>HBQ True Wireless Price</h2>
<p>When we said affordable, we weren&rsquo;t joking. These earbuds are basically all over the web right now. Yep, there are loads of sellers offering these earbuds on Amazon&nbsp;right now. Coming in at around the &pound;35-mark, it&rsquo;s clear to see the advantages of buying these affordable wireless earphones. Kerching!</p>
