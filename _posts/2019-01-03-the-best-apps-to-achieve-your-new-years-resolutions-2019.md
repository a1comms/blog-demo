<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Make this year the best yet with these handy apps!</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s officially day 3 of 2019&hellip; How are those resolutions going so far?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made a list of goals for the year, it&rsquo;s time to get started. Your life won&rsquo;t level up all by itself. You&rsquo;re going to have to put some groundwork in.</p>
<p>Here are some apps to help you out.</p>
<h2>1) Learn How to Be Mindful</h2>
<p>Mindfulness is more than a fleeting fad &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a great way to relax and unwind.</p>
<p>As we all have super busy lives and schedules, finding just the briefest of moments in which to relax can be a difficult feat. The <strong>Stop, Breathe, and Think App</strong> helps you do all of the above.</p>
<p>You start by letting the app know how you&rsquo;re feeling, i.e. whether you&rsquo;re stressed, tired, angry etc. The app then suggests a whole range of free mindful tracks that you can listen to.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you can also choose whether you want a male or female voice. Whatever floats your boat! (Note: There is a premium version of the app, which unlocks more tracks.)</p>

<p><strong>You can Download Stop, Breathe, and Think for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/stop-breathe-think/id778848692?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.stopbreathethink.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android.</a></strong></p>
<h2>2) Reduce Your Stress Levels</h2>
<p>Feeling stressed out? If you want 2019 to be the year that you finally take control of your stress levels, there&rsquo;s one free iOS and Android app that you need to download.</p>
<p>Combining cognitive behavioural therapy techniques and a healthy dose of mindfulness, the <strong>Pacifica App</strong> should be your go-to guide to getting on top of the problem.</p>
<p>Each day, you will learn new skills and tools to help you manage your mental health. Genius.</p>

<p><strong>Download Pacifica for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pacifica-tools-for-stress/id922968861?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pacificalabs.pacifica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android.</a></strong></p>
<h2>3)&nbsp;Drink More Water</h2>
<p>Good hydration is the key to feeling more energised and healthy. One of your 2019 resolutions could be as simple as drinking more water.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Water</strong> is a free iOS app that reminds you when to top up your cup and guzzle the stuff down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you happen to be an Android user, <strong>Water Time</strong> could be the app for you. The two free apps are strikingly similar and both could help you remember to drink up!</p>

<p><strong>Download Daily Water for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-water-free-water-reminder/id466387763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and Water Time for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilecreatures.drinkwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android.</a></strong></p>
<h2>4) Drink Less Alcohol (for Real, This Time!)</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a doctor to tell you that drinking too much alcohol is bad for your health. It&rsquo;s true. We all know it. However, for some of us, cutting back can be a real struggle.</p>
<p>If one of your New Year&rsquo;s resolutions is to drink less, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with the <strong>Drinkaware App</strong>.</p>
<p>The handy little app tracks how much you drink, how much it costs you, how many calories you&rsquo;re consuming and more.</p>
<p>It uses that information to give you graphs and stats so that you have a visual representation of your alcohol intake. The idea is that you can see how much you&rsquo;re drinking and look for small ways to start cutting back.</p>

<p><strong>Download Drinkaware for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drinkaware-track-calculate/id901389586?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.drinkaware&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dreferral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android.</a></strong></p>
<h2>5) Leave That Job You Hate</h2>
<p>Do you wake up with a knot in your stomach? If the thought of heading to the office makes you feel down in the dumps, it could be time for a change.</p>
<p>One of the most life-changing New Year&rsquo;s resolutions you can make is to get a brand new job. Downloading the <strong>Indeed App</strong> on your phone could be a smart first step.</p>
<p>At just the touch of a button, you can check out the latest postings online and see what positions are available near you.</p>

<h2>6)&nbsp;Finally Find the &lsquo;One&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Could 2019 be the year of love for you? If you&rsquo;re looking for the &lsquo;one,&rsquo; it may be time to take the plunge and download a dating app.</p>
<p>While there are loads of hookup apps out there, one of the best happens to be <strong>Bumble</strong>.</p>
<p>Like other apps of this nature, you set up a profile on the site and then can flick through singletons in your area. However, if you match with someone, the twist here is that only women can initiate a conversation.</p>

<h2>7)&nbsp;Eat Less Junk (and Cook More)</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s late and you&rsquo;ve just got home from work. You&rsquo;re tired, stressed, but most importantly, hungry. What do you do? For most of us, the answer is simple &ndash;&nbsp;order a cheeky takeaway.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;ve resolved to change your ways and eat less junk food, you&rsquo;re going to need to rethink that plan. Cooking doesn&rsquo;t have to be a chore, so long as you have some helpful tools (i.e. Android and iOS apps) to help you along the way.</p>
<p>One of the best recipe apps for your smartphone is <strong>BBC Cook Food</strong>. It&rsquo;s jam-packed with more than 10,000 healthful recipes that you can try for yourself. Plus, there&rsquo;s a handy search bar on the main page of the app, which allows you to look for a specific type of recipe in mere seconds.</p>
<p>When you find a recipe that you love, you can even save it on the app so that you can come back to it time and time again. Get cooking!</p>
