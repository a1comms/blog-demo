<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Google Assistant is going to be a huge upgrade!</span></p>
<p>In some rather exciting news for Android geeks all around the world, Google recently announced its latest AI companion, Google Assistant, is rolling out to more Android smartphones.</p>
<p>This piece of news is one of the most exciting to come from MWC 2017, up there with the announcement of LG G6.</p>
<p>Why? Before now, Google Assistant had only been available for a select few devices, including Google Pixel and Android Wear smartwatches. However, the feature will soon be available to people with phones running both Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</p>

<h2>Hang on, What Is Google Assistant?</h2>
<p>Good question&hellip; for those that don&rsquo;t know, Google Assistant is a digital, erm, assistant that is capable of answering various questions from the capital of Botswana to the correct way to ask for directions home in Spanish.</p>
<p>Google Assistant also helps out with tasks, like setting reminders, booking reservations and sending messages. And it doesn&rsquo;t whine or demand time off, like a real assistant.</p>

<h2>Awesome!&nbsp;When Can I Get It?</h2>
<p>While American users will have access to Google Assistant in the first week of March 2017, us Brits will have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>As soon as the Assistant is released, users with compatible devices will be able to access it via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&amp;hl=en">Google Play Services</a>. It won&rsquo;t be long until we&rsquo;re all &lsquo;Googling it&rsquo; using our voices, for just about everything from where the nearest pub is to how long you&rsquo;ve got until your flight.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, some smartphones will arrive with Google Assistant straight out of the box. For example, the highly-anticipated LG G6 is all set to include the digital assistant when it launches this April.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13390" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i9_HWfdJPxRLYXbFGLPl4gVMZGHh1AXS-cc7w4YzvnTBspTT3rUtK_VJuV0vIgcY2sP4Dk5dTCkqsbEuLQDOl9hw=s0" width="600" height="316" /></p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not by any means the only flagship phone to boast Google Assistant. Google has revealed that other &lsquo;partner devices&rsquo; will include the likes of Sony, Huawei, Samsung and HTC.</p>
<p>During the announcement, the Google officials claimed that their aim &ldquo;is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it." That means they&rsquo;ll be looking to feature it on more gadgets than your smartphone, reaching out to smart TVs, household appliances and god knows what else.</p>

<p>Google Assistant looks ready to rival the likes of Siri and Alexa. However, with Apple boasting that the latest update of Siri will be more "enhanced" than ever, the battle of the AIs is very much on.</p>
