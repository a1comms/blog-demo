<p><span class="postStandFirst">As we draw closer to the launch date of Windows 10 for mobile, we now know which lucky smartphones will be getting it first.<br />
</span></p>
<p>People from around the&nbsp;world are downloading Windows 10 on&nbsp;their PCs, but the PC world is only part of the Windows 10 equation. It&rsquo;s also coming to Windows mobile phones, and while we don&rsquo;t yet know when it will land, we do now know something rather important.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;now know which Lumia phones are going to be the first to get the brand new version of Microsoft&rsquo;s smartphone platform.</p>
<p>The list of phones getting Windows 10 Mobile first is as follow:&nbsp;Lumia 430,&nbsp;Lumia 435,&nbsp;Lumia 532,&nbsp;Lumia 535,&nbsp;Lumia 540,&nbsp;Lumia 640,&nbsp;Lumia 640 XL,&nbsp;Lumia 735,&nbsp;Lumia 830 and&nbsp;Lumia 930.</p>
<p>It's great to see a&nbsp;breadth of handset categories covered, rather than just a small select group. That way, lots more Windows Phone users will be able to relish Windows 10 when it eventually rolls out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But before it does, you'll need to install the Lumia Denim update. To do so, follow Microsoft's handy <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp7/basics/how-do-i-update-my-phone-software" target="_blank">update instructions.</a></p>
<p><strong>Do that, and when Windows 10 Mobile lands, you&rsquo;ll be able to take your Lumia phone to the next level.</strong></p>
