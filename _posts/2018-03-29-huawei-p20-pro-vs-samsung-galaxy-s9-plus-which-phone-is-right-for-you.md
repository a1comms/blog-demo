<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Two of the biggest phones of the year go head-to-head!</span></p>
<p>Looking for a phone that&rsquo;s larger than life? Two of the best options have to be the Huawei P20 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus.</p>
<p>While both devices are powerful and have a whole load of awesome features, there are some pretty major differences between the two. Not sure which one is right for you? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FI2CpNdaJAc" width="600" height="335" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Spoiler: There&rsquo;s a definite theme going on here. Put the two phones side by side and you&rsquo;re sure to notice something. The smartphones are quite similar looking. Both sport a metal and glass finish with a massive screen.</p>
<p>There are thin bezels on both of the screens here, which makes for a minimal and stylised look. Still, the Huawei P20 Pro has a small notch on the top of the device. It&rsquo;s not a huge difference, but it&rsquo;s enough to mark the two apart.</p>

<p>When it comes to colours, the Huawei is currently available in Black. The finish is dazzling and one of the most impressive design features of the new phone. The Samsung, on the other hand, comes in Midnight Black, Coral Blue, and the star of the show, Lilac Purple.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Size matters when it comes to modern-day smartphone screens. There&rsquo;s very little between the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and the Huawei P20 Pro. The former comes in at 6.2 inches, while the latter has a marginally smaller 6.1-inch screen. You won&rsquo;t notice much difference when using the phones, but it does exist!</p>

<p>The Huawei P20 Pro offers an impressive 1080 x 2244 OLED display, while the Samsung has a 1440 x 2960 Super AMOLED. It&rsquo;s fair to say that Samsung&rsquo;s offering is a little sharper than that of the Huawei but it&rsquo;s a minor difference. In truth, the two phones both have remarkable displays and won&rsquo;t disappoint anybody out there.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>As you may already know, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus comes with a whole load of awesome features. We&rsquo;re talking about DeX, Bixby, Bixby Food, Facial Recognition, a neat rear fingerprint scanner, and, of course, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/ar-emoji-on-samsung-galaxy-s9-explained-and-how-to-use-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AR Emoji</a>. It&rsquo;s a great little lineup and one that&rsquo;s already won over hordes of people.</p>
<p>So, what's the Huawei P20 Pro bringing to the table? Well, there&rsquo;s a fingerprint scanner on the front, amazing camera capabilities (we&rsquo;ll get to those in a minute!), AI features, and super-fast charging. While the phone does have a load to offer, it may struggle to compete with the force that is Samsung.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&rsquo;s deal with the elephant in the room here! There&rsquo;s no headphone jack on the P20 Pro&hellip; but there is on the Samsung. However, pre-order your Huawei P20 Pro with us and you can claim a set of free Bose wireless headphones. So, it's swings and roundabouts really.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the Huawei P20 Pro really does excel. It has a whopping three camera lens on the back &ndash; a 40-megapixel f/1.6 monochrome sensor, an 8-megapixel telephoto sensor, and a 12-megapixel f/1.8 RGB sensor. The combination is impressive and means that you can get a picture with some serious depth. There&rsquo;s also 19 different camera modes. And not forgetting, there&rsquo;s also a 24-megapixel selfie camera too. Nice.</p>

<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, which has two 12-megapixel cameras instead. It&rsquo;s still a decent offering, but pales in comparison. The front-facing camera lens is 8-megapixel. Still, the images are sharp and there&rsquo;s also Pro Mode, which is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.</p>

<h2>Storage and Power</h2>
<p>The Huawei P20 Pro runs the brand&rsquo;s latest chipset &ndash; the octa-core Kirin 970. However, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that Samsung&rsquo;s Snapdragon 845 is actually newer. Both devices offer 6GB of RAM and are more than powerful enough for most users. You really shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with either of the devices here.</p>
<p>But wait, what batteries are these phones packing? Well, the Samsung has a super big 3500mAh battery. In fact, for a while, it seemed to be the biggest out there. Then the Huawei P20 Pro was announced. Yes, it happens to have a 4000mAh battery. Talk about one-upmanship.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it &ndash; these two devices are at the top end of the market, but do they have top-end prices? Well, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus comes in at the &pound;869-mark. It might not be the highest price tag out there (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Apple!) but it is raising the bar. The Huawei P20 Pro is a little cheaper, with a starting price of &pound;799.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which of these new phones should you choose? Well, that really depends on what you want from your phone. Both the Samsung and the Huawei offer a range of great features, a space-aged design, and a massive screen. Win. Win. And win.</p>
<p>However, the Samsung does offer a little more in terms of features, such as the headphone jack and Facial Recognition. Whether those little extras are worth spending some more pennies is completely up to you.</p>
<p>Then again, the P20 Pro has an amazing camera and a larger battery than we&rsquo;ve seen before now. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s a tough choice. One thing is for sure &ndash; whichever phone you choose, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
