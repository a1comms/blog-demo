<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">HTC 10 goes out on a limb with a new design. Will it be regret or reward for HTC? This is what we think.</span></p>
<p>HTC One M9 was something of a hiccup for the Taiwanese-based smartphone company. Sure, it was powerful and eye-pleasing, but it didn&rsquo;t quite differentiate itself enough from previous, more popular models, like HTC One M7 and M8.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that HTC felt a little more pressure than usual this year, to make up for lost ground. Though, if that was the case, it didn&rsquo;t show, because HTC 10 &ndash; which ditched the &lsquo;One&rsquo; and &lsquo;M&rsquo; &ndash; has hit the ground running, despite stiff competition of <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> and LG G5.</p>
<p>As the latest flagship from HTC, it&rsquo;s of course packed full of exciting new technology, and, learning from last year&rsquo;s mistake, has adopted a new and improved design. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>HTC has always had a flair for beautiful craftsmanship, and HTC 10 is the pinnacle of said skills. Cased in a single piece of aircraft grade aluminium, with chamfered edges and precision laser-cut lines, HTC 10 looks and feels like one of the best on the market.</p>

<p>HTC has more or less taken the best aesthetic qualities of the One series, and seamlessly blended&nbsp;them with the beautiful fa&ccedil;ade of HTC A9, which, unfortunately, is no longer available on the market.</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>The display on HTC 10 offers a&nbsp;bump in pixel count, seeing HTC take its first step out of the confines of 1080p, and join the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 with a 2K (Quad HD) unit. As you can imagine, such a staggering number of pixels results in images as sharp as a hedgehog&rsquo;s bristle.</p>

<p>At 5.2-inches, HTC 10&rsquo;s display is spacious enough to watch movies comfortably, made better by a striking colour balance and a strong level of brightness. Simply put, this is one of the best screens on the market.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>As with most flagships released this year, HTC has opted for a Snapdragon 820 processor, Adreno 520 GPU and 4GB of RAM combination.</p>
<p>The result is a near flawless performance when doing the things you need your HTC 10 for, like multi-tasking, web browsing and playing demanding games. All of which is fuelled by a large 3000mAh battery, full of enough power for nearly two days&rsquo; usage.</p>
<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>Something we know will delight users, is the improved set of cameras. HTC 10 claims an industry first, featuring a front-facing 5-megapixel camera that&rsquo;s complete with optical image stabilisation (OIS &ndash; to counteract shakiness) and UltraPixel technology. The upshot &ndash; your selfie game will reach new, untold heights.</p>
<p>The rear camera offers 12-megapixels and features laser focus, OIS and a wide-angle lens. Both cameras promise&nbsp;incredible capture and image replication so you can be sure to secure those magic moments in fantastic quality.</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>Known for being one of the best in the business for audio output, HTC has done it again with a new take on HTC BoomSound; featuring a mini tweeter and woofer, HTC 10 is an audiophiles dream. Chuck in 24-bit DAC jack output and you have yourself one heck of a music maestro.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Running Android 6.0.1 straight from the box, HTC has implemented its Sense UI on top, to smooth out, speed up and enhance Google&rsquo;s stock offering. The software boasts lots of custom extras whilst retaining the clean, clutter-free nature of Android stock OS.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Aside from the usual collection of mod cons, such as GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, USB Type-C and 4G LTE, the HTC 10 also comes with a whopping 32GB internal storage that can be expanded using MicroSD cards (up to 200GB), and a nifty fingerprint sensor.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Wonderful to look at, incredible to hold and even better to use, HTC has put last year&rsquo;s disappointing performance behind it, and, once again, created a masterpiece of a smartphone. Without question, this is one of the finest money can buy, reminding us that HTC is back to its best.</p>
