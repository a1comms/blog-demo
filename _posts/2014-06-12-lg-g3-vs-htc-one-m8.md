<p><span class="postStandFirst">It&rsquo;s time for another superphone showdown, as we pit the newly announced LG G3, against the phone whose camera is made of magic, the HTC One M8. Who will win in this battle of five rounds, as we judge both in terms of Design, Power, Screen, Camera and Battery Life? It's the&nbsp;LG G3 vs HTC One M8 and there&rsquo;s only one way to find out... FIGHT!</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken before about how the&nbsp;HTC One M8&nbsp;is a truly gorgeous phone, and about how its camera seems to be based on sorcery rather than technology. We really do love the One M8, but now, there&rsquo;s a new superphone, one whose camera also has a trick up its sleeve...</p>
<p>No prizes for guessing that we&rsquo;re talking about the LG G3, because quite frankly,&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;is talking about the&nbsp;LG G3&nbsp;right now. Mind you, there&rsquo;s a good reason for that, because the LG G3 is&nbsp;<em>gob-smackingly</em>&nbsp;brilliant. Of course, the HTC One M8 is&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;gob-smackingly brilliant, and that poses a bit of a challenge, because we now need to try and work out which of the two is&nbsp;<em>better</em>.</p>
<p>So, once again, make yourself a brew and get comfy, because it&rsquo;s time for another superphone showdown!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2931/14141827220_36d28cea1c.jpg" width="500" height="320" /></span></strong></p>
<p>In true fence-sitters&rsquo; fashion, we&rsquo;ll begin with a category that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>entirely</em>&nbsp;subjective, and for which, therefore, we can&rsquo;t pick an outright winner. To put it simply, both phones are gorgeous, although the&nbsp; HTC One M8 scores extra points for actually&nbsp;<em>having</em>&nbsp;a metal body, instead of merely&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;like it has one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, the bezels around the LG G3&rsquo;s screen are noticeably thinner than on the One M8, which means that although its screen is half an inch bigger than HTC&rsquo;s flagship, the LG G3&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>body</em>&nbsp;is actually near enough the same size (it&rsquo;s slightly wider than the HTC One M8, but it&rsquo;s actually marginally&nbsp;<em>shorter</em>)!</p>
<p>And so, we really can&rsquo;t pick an outright winner, so this first category is a draw!</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2911/14305507606_6109af1e03.jpg" width="500" height="300" /></span></strong></p>
<p>We may have to admit, at this point, that the &lsquo;Power&rsquo; category&rsquo;s going to be a draw, as well, due to one simple fact: internally, both phones are almost identical. Both use a Snapdragon 801 processor (as do rival superphones like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2), both have an Adreno 330 GPU, and both have 2GB of RAM.</p>
<p>And so, this second category comes out in a draw, as well, but the next category, that&rsquo;s going to be where things start to get interesting...</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14424528413_f49575fd0b.jpg" width="375" height="500" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat about the bush, because everyone who&rsquo;s read about the LG G3 before will know that its screen is better than&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;other phone on the market. That 1440p Quad-HD screen is, by a considerable margin, the sharpest, most beautiful smartphone screen we&rsquo;ve ever seen, and so, the LG G3 wins this category by a landslide!</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/13408842824_11b9a818f7.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></span></strong></p>
<p>After the G3 won the last category easily, it&rsquo;s time for the HTC One M8 to make its triumphant comeback: while the camera on the LG G3 has &ldquo;Laser Focus&rdquo; (which doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;use a laser, instead using a kind of infra-red range-finder, which reduces the time it takes for the camera to focus on whatever you want to snap a photo of), the HTC One M8 has a Duo Camera, that allows you to apply effects just to the foreground or background, in real-time, and change the focus of the picture&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s been taken.</p>
<p>As cool as the LG G3 is, a laser-that&rsquo;s-not-actually-a-laser can&rsquo;t beat the ability to superimpose your friends into an A-Ha video, so the HTC One M8 wins this round!</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3805/14288329932_85491ef62a.jpg" width="414" height="500" /></span></strong></p>
<p>And finally, we come to perhaps the biggest surprise of this showdown: the battery life of the two phones. You&rsquo;d think that the LG G3, a phone with a bigger and vastly sharper screen, would drink way more power than the HTC One M8, right?</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn&rsquo;t, as the G3&rsquo;s screen controller only uses as much power as a 1080p screen; combine that with a bigger battery, and it means the battery life of each of these two phones will be surprisingly similar, in spite of the vastly more awesome screen in the LG G3!</p>
<p><strong>And so, we come to our big conclusion, and looking at the results, LG G3 vs HTC One M8&nbsp;ends up being a draw! Once again, we have to say that&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;phones are better,&nbsp;<em>depending on your own individual needs.</em>&nbsp;If you want the best screen, grab the LG G3. If you want the best camera, grab the HTC One M8. Either way, you&rsquo;ll be getting one of the greatest phones money can buy!</strong></p>
