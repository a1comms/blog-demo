<p><b></b><span class="postStandFirst">LG has announced a new game for the LG G3, one which doesn&rsquo;t even need you to open the phone&rsquo;s case to play it. The game in question is Puppy Pop, and you can play it through the circular window in the QuickCircle case that&rsquo;s available for the phone. While it&rsquo;s probably not going to change the world, it&rsquo;s nonetheless a fun little diversion!</span></p>

<p>The LG G3 is, as we keep telling to everyone we meet, one of the single greatest smartphones the world has ever seen, and it includes a couple of features that really mark it out as unique, thus making it even <i>more</i> attractive.</p>
<p>We already know about the unbelievably sharp Quad-HD screen, and the camera that comes with Laser Focus, but the <i>newest</i> feature that&rsquo;s landed on the LG G3 is, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/23/lg-quickcircle-case-game/">Engadget</a>, the ability to play games without unlocking the phone or, in fact, opening the case at all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4765" alt="quickcircle case" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/LG-G3-Quick-Circle-case.jpg" width="571" height="286" /></p>
<p>The game in question is called Puppy Pop, and it&rsquo;s designed to showcase the new opportunities afforded by the LG G3&rsquo;s &ldquo;QuickCircle&rdquo; case, a case with a hole in the front of it, similar to the &ldquo;window&rdquo; case that Samsung made for the Samsung Galaxy S5.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not the most <i>in-depth</i> game in the world, the gameplay revolving around matching as many puppy heads as possible within the time limit. That&rsquo;s never going to tax the phenomenally fast Snapdragon 801 processor in the LG G3, but in spite of that, it&rsquo;s a fun little time-waster and it <i>does</i> serve as a nice demo of what&rsquo;s possible with the QuickCircle case.</p>
<p>The QuickCircle case is something that a lot of LG G3 users have already fallen in love with, as it allows for a lot of useful interactions (checking the time, placing calls, taking photos, and so on) to be done without having to unlock the phone.</p>
<p><strong>While it&rsquo;s not world-shaking, Puppy Pop is a fun little diversion, and if you have an LG G3 (or plan on getting one), then you should definitely check it out!<br />
