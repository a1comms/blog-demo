<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about tbh!</span></p>
<p>Facebook has bought a brand-new app that&rsquo;s just nine weeks old. Called <em>tbh</em>, which stands for <em>to be honest</em>, it aims to encourage teens to be nice to one another.</p>
<p>So, why has Facebook jumped on this app? Well, there&rsquo;s one simple reason: It&rsquo;s been downloaded a whopping five million times since it was released. Yes, you could say that it&rsquo;s something of a viral hit among the teen market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today we crossed a major milestone: 1 billion polls answered &#x1f389;<br />
Special thanks to our wonderful community <a href="https://t.co/cYVT8yLuXE">pic.twitter.com/cYVT8yLuXE</a></p>

<p>Despite having been bought by the massive corporation that is Facebook, the app&rsquo;s creator has said that it will remain a standalone program. However, with the help of the social media site, the team behind tbh will have access to many more resources than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the last decade of the Internet has been focused on open communication, the next milestone will be around meeting people&rsquo;s emotional needs,&rdquo; said an official statement by tbh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we met with Facebook, we realised that we shared many of the same core values about connecting people through positive interactions. Most of all, we were compelled by the ways they could help us realise tbh&rsquo;s vision and bring it to more people.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thanks for using tbh&#x1f499;&#x1f49a;&#x1f49b;&#x1f49c; <a href="https://t.co/zt8mYC1mFG">pic.twitter.com/zt8mYC1mFG</a></p>

<p>The price Facebook paid for tbh hasn&rsquo;t been disclosed, though TechCrunch says that it amounted to "less than $100m." What&rsquo;s more, word has it that the four foundering members of tbh will now work for Facebook as part of the deal.</p>
<p>"This is the latest example of Facebook snapping up a start-up that could potentially game-change the way people consume social media and erode its own user base," Prof Mark Skilton from Warwick Business School told the BBC.</p>
<p>"Tbh appeals to the teen market - which we know is a very fickle age group - and Facebook knows that it and other apps like it can go viral and explode in popularity very quickly. So, this can be seen as a protective measure, and $100m is the equivalent of an account sheet rounding error - it's no money to them."</p>
<h2>What is tbh?</h2>
<p>So, how does the app work? Well, one of the best things about tbh is its restriction on negative comments, or, indeed, trolling.</p>
<p>When you log in, you&rsquo;re asked predetermined questions, such as &lsquo;best to bring to a party?&rsquo; The idea is that you offer a friend&rsquo;s name who you believe fits the bill.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">my sister got voted "most likely to survive the hunger games" at school so now I'm not really worried about her making it to graduation</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, if&nbsp;<em>you&rsquo;ve</em> been chosen as an answer, you get a notification to let you know. But the details of who chose you are kept anonymous. It&rsquo;s a great idea, especially as it allows no room for online bullying.</p>
<p>"We shipped it to one school in Georgia," the apps co-founder Nikita Bier, told TechCrunch recently. "Forty percent of the school downloaded it the first day. The next day it was in three more schools, and then the next day it was in 300 schools."</p>
