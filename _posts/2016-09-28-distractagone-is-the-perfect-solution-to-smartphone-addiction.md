<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Finally, no more drunk dialling.</span></p>
<p>We know you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. But remember that time you sank a few too many spirits, and suddenly thought, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a marvellous idea to message my ex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we just found the perfect prevention to your regret-filled texts. And no, don&rsquo;t worry, it doesn&rsquo;t involve drinking any less booze. The solution is a simple little lockbox called DistractaGone.</p>
<p>Gaining serious heat on Kickstarter, the home of emerging tech projects, DistractaGone aims to combat your smartphone compulsion any time you want to avoid distractions. Or drunken indiscretions.</p>
<p>The concept couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Place your phone in the box, set the time to an appropriate amount, lock the box and crack on with whatever requires your focus, interruption free.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_11696" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-11696" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/09/DistractaGone-Bling.jpg" alt="distractagone-bling" width="600" height="315" /> When the bling's louder than your mobile ring.[/caption]</p>
<p>There are plenty of real-world situations where DistractaGone might come in handy. As a productive measure for keeping your head in the zone at work, for one, rather than your attractive new colleague&rsquo;s Instagram profile.</p>
<p>It could even be a fun (though much more likely, tortuous) party piece in new social situations, encouraging good old fashioned conversation.</p>
<p>Further still, DistractaGone may just position itself as the new &lsquo;date night&rsquo; essential amongst veteran couples, who want to enjoy just one evening without any&nbsp;periphery distractions.</p>

<p>All that being said, DistractaGone&rsquo;s novel approach to easing our smartphone dependencies does present an inescapable complication. One that may just be its undoing. And that&rsquo;s the fact that your mobile phone is locked in box.</p>
<p>It seems obvious, given that the whole premise of DistractaGone revolves around locking your mobile away. But in some sort of emergency, the little locked box become a lot less cute, and lot more in the way of you dialling 999.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/769928956/distractagone-find-focus-fast" target="_blank">DistractaGone&rsquo;s Kickstarter page</a>, &lsquo;furiously forcing&rsquo; it to open will do the trick. But by doing so, you&rsquo;ll probably brake the box, therefore tragically wasting the money spent on it.</p>
<p>DistractaGone, we like&nbsp;the idea, but it might&nbsp;need a little rethink.</p>
