<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Will it survive? Our guess is no&hellip; Watch the video below.</span></p>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-32gb-black" target="_blank">iPhone 7</a> released back in September, there&rsquo;s been the usual hype that surrounds every new Apple launch. As per, everyone and their nan was&nbsp;flocking to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>Should you have been lucky enough to secure an iPhone 7 so early, the very last thing you&rsquo;d want to do is drop it. Over the years, we&rsquo;ve cringed at the horror stories where people accidentally let their iPhone plunge into the loo, or tumble to the sidewalk, smashing the screen in the process.</p>
<p>Yet some, often those with more money than sense, insist on performing drop-tests. Which, if you haven&rsquo;t heard of before, is essentially a controlled experiment to assess whether an iPhone can survive being dropped from a particular height.</p>
<p>And so, pushing drop-tests to their limits, we present to you the following video, in which one Ukrainian vlogger flings a brand new iPhone 7 from the top of a really, really big building. And not just any big building. The crazed tech fan (or tech hater, depending on your outlook) threw the iPhone 7 off the world&rsquo;s tallest building &ndash; the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11825" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Mr-Bean-Shock.gif" alt="mr-bean-shock" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re not up on the exact height of the world&rsquo;s tallest skyscraper, here&rsquo;s a little perspective for you. The high-rise actually stands at 2720 feet, which makes it just about twice as high as the Empire State building. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s not made for those with a strong fear of heights or lifts!</p>
<p>The vlogger, who claims that he &lsquo;specialises in smashing technology for your pleasure,&rsquo; carried out this experiment on behalf of TechRax. While most of us would think that dropping any smartphone of any building in the world is nothing short of sheer wastefulness, and, we might add <em>very dangerous</em>, these guys believe that it&rsquo;s all fun and games.</p>
<p>Watch the video for yourself now. Oh, and please, <em>don&rsquo;t try this kind of stunt at home</em>.</p>

<p>So, did the iPhone survive the 2000+ foot drop? The short answer is no. The whole thing is actually pretty anticlimactic. After the vlogger dropped the phone off the edge of the building, leaving it to descend swiftly to its demise, not all that much happened. I mean, try finding a small object that you&rsquo;ve dropped from thousands of feet in the air. It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>The guy tried to locate the iPhone 7 (which was presumably smashed up in little pieces somewhere - poor thing) using an app, but to no avail. He decided that the gadget had been &lsquo;completely fried&rsquo; - and we&rsquo;re guessing that he was most likely correct in that one.</p>
