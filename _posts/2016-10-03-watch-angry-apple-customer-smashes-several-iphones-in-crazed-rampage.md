<p>When your stress levels peak, it only takes one more annoying thing to happen before you lose it altogether. Whether it&rsquo;s getting a small case of road rage or snapping at your boss when you really shouldn&rsquo;t, we all lash out from time to time. Still, most of us don&rsquo;t go ahead and start breaking thousands of pounds&rsquo; worth of stuff now, do we?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just what one upset Apple customer did recently. The unnamed offender went into a local store over in Dijon (yes, like the mustard!), France hoping to get a refund. Hey, we&rsquo;ve all been there, right? Return policies can be a real pain, especially if you happen to find yourself outside of them!</p>
<p>The guy had obviously had some kind of argument with the staff in the store and was ultimately told that a refund wasn&rsquo;t on the table, no matter how much he moaned or how loudly he complained. Rather than walking away there and then, and perhaps writing a poor review online, the man decided to quite literally take matters into his own hands.</p>
<p>The enraged customer presumably planned the entire attack upon returning home, because he marched straight into the Apple store gripping a steel ball, even wearing a glove to protect his hand. Moments later, all hell broke loose in the quiet, unassuming store once the man began smashing dozens of brand new iPhone 7s into tiny little pieces.</p>

<p>Talk about anger issues! While we&rsquo;ve all done some silly things when we&rsquo;ve been upset in the past, this is just incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Luckily, the entire thing was caught on camera since another customer had the foresight to whip out their phone (we can neither deny or confirm that this was an iPhone) the moment the whole crazy fiasco started. In the video, which is posted below, you can see the vandal really getting into it, all the while chattering away to the camera.</p>
<p>After having broken a fair few iPhones, he moves onto some of the other popular Apple products in the store. It&rsquo;d seem that this guy&rsquo;s not willing to leave the shop until he&rsquo;s ruined just about everything in sight. From iPads to the brand new (rather beautiful) range of Macs, nothing is safe from this disgruntled customer&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>Watching the video, it feels like this man&nbsp;is&nbsp;set on making a point. He wanted to make sure that the whole world knew <em>just </em>how livid he was with Apple and its&nbsp;staff. For those of you who don&rsquo;t happen to speak French, Mashable have translated some of his dialogue.</p>
<p>"Apple is a company that 'violated' European consumers' rights,&rdquo; the customer says while in the midst of his smashing rampage. "They refused to reimburse me, I told them: 'Give me my money back'. They said no. So you know what's happening? This is happening!"</p>
<p>Of course, this is the real world and you can&rsquo;t parade about with a steel ball, pulverising everything in sight and expect get away with it! Shortly after the footage was filmed, the customer was taken down by security and, obviously, arrested by the police a little later. While we&rsquo;re not sure of the exact criminal charges he faces, it&rsquo;s safe to say that the ex-Apple customer will not be welcome back in store anytime soon.</p>
