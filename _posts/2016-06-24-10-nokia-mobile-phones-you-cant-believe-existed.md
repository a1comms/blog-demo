<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Ten times Nokia didn't give a single f**k.</span></p>
<p>Nokia, what happened to you, bro? You used to have so much swag back in the day, with your kooky, bordering on zany, mobile phone designs.</p>
<p>While the rest of the industry was pouring money into smart and innovative new features &ndash; what chumps &ndash; you guys kept it real by thinking up wacky new ways of packaging your phones.</p>
<p>Sure, eventually you fell out of favour and everyone stopped buying your handsets, but we at least admired your courage and creativity.</p>
<p>And to celebrate it, and your once great brand, we&rsquo;ve compiled 10 of our favourite, completely mental Nokia mobile phones.</p>
<h2>1) Nokia 3650 (2002)</h2>
<p>At a time when absolutely no one had a problem with rectangular keypads, Nokia thought to hell with them, the people want their keys awkwardly positioned in a circle. That&rsquo;s when Nokia 3650 was born. Poor guy.</p>

<h2>2) Nokia 7600 (2003)</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between a Tamagotchi and a mobile phone, the Nokia 7600 has to be one of the most bizarrely&nbsp;shaped devices ever made. Nokia got everything from the button layout, to the leaf-like design, completely wrong. Yet I was desperate for one at the time...</p>

<h2>3) Nokia 6800 (2003)</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not until you have something new, that you think, &ldquo;How did I ever cope with life before this?&rdquo; I imagine that&rsquo;s what Nokia 6800 users thought when their keypad suddenly divided in two, transforming into a full on&nbsp;QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<h2>4) Nokia N-Gage (2003)</h2>
<p>I owned one of these as a teenager and desperately wanted to love it. But despite my best efforts, it really sucked as a handheld games console. Particularly when Nintendo had just released its Game Boy Advance SP and I was tearing it up on Pok&eacute;mon Ruby.</p>

<h2>5) Nokia 3200 (2003)</h2>
<p>The only saving grace with Nokia 3200 was that you could remove the interchangeable covers, and not have to look at the same, Art Deco inspired one for too long.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10669" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Nokia-3200.jpeg" alt="Nokia 3200" width="600" height="374"><br />

<h2>6) Nokia 7700 (2003)</h2>
<p>This one didn&rsquo;t quite make it to market, but was intended to be the first multimedia smartphone, with a touchscreen, camera, FM radio, Bluetooth and web browser. Nokia 7700 will be forever remembered as the X Wing pilot helmet that almost was.</p>

<h2>7) Nokia 7280 (2005)</h2>
<p>Nokia really mugged us off with this one, because at first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t even look like a mobile phone. Or the second glance for that matter. With a spinning wheel for navigation, Nokia 7280 looks like an ambitious effort to fuse an iPod and lipstick. Super weird.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10671" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Nokia-7280.jpg" alt="Nokia 7280" width="600" height="375"></p>

<h2>8) Nokia N90 (2005)</h2>
<p>Now this phone was totally bad-ass. Mind-blowing, swivelling engineering meant Nokia N90 could transform into a compact video camera in just a couple of seconds. Yeah the video quality was woeful and it meant answering calls was a ball-ache, but look at it.</p>

<h2>9) Nokia 3250 (2005)</h2>
<p>With a rotating keyboard, Nokia 3250 was like the world&rsquo;s easiest Rubik&rsquo;s Cube. But instead of revealing a new row of colours, the flip side featured some basic MP3 controls, letting you play, stop, skip and return.</p>

<h2>10) Nokia 7370 (2005)</h2>
<p>Targeting the fashion-conscious, Nokia 7370 was adorned with a fetching floral pattern that always reminded me of a blingy Japanese flower garden. The display looked like a slider, but was actually way funkier than that. It kind of slid and rotated 180 degrees, in one slick motion.</p>
