<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The two best Huawei mobile phones go head-to-head.</span></p>
<p>In case you missed it, Huawei launched a brand-new mobile this week &ndash;&nbsp;the Mate 20 Pro.</p>
<p>As slick as it is powerful, the flagship Huawei is one that is certain to raise the bar when it comes to new handsets in 2018.</p>
<p>But wait, how does it compare to the already popular <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P20 Pro</a>? Let&rsquo;s take a moment to weigh up its features and compare the two, to find out.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2Ed2CTVqAg" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Both the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the Huawei P20 Pro boast minimalist and sleek designs.</p>
<p>On the Mate 20 Pro, though, Huawei has fully ditched the fingerprint scanner at the bottom, integrating it into the screen instead. Genius.</p>
<p>That means that there&rsquo;s no wasted space at the bottom of the device, which makes it look a little more refined. And another bonus is the Mate 20 Pro has a slightly more curvaceous back and is therefore more comfortable to hold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19223" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EfIVIT7yNe35j2teBwR9xq2nkpdhbWgv7sABiRJlRVmthYD7uJB5M7Zs9pa__GALdMAFOav82zc40wMHZKZmihb_=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Both Huawei mobiles feature small notch at the top, which is noticeable. But it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way too much, so it&rsquo;s not a huge issue.</p>
<p>The notch is considerably smaller on the P20 Pro, if this is a particular selling point for you.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_19211" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-19211 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uv0Hng3u5Hqjb236KJ19paQ9o0zbGBWah8S0FUeIi1FKncDN4HrWsTAAwKSHfnRKMEmd7cyHhqRyMHI0nlj6Mnb6=s0" alt="" width="600" height="400" /> Huawei P20 Pro, front and back.[/caption]</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both available in black, as well as Huawei&rsquo;s now iconic twilight colour.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Boasting a whopping 6.39-inch screen, Huawei Mate 20 Pro has dialled up the heat a little here, compared to the P20 Pro&rsquo;s still sizeable 6.1-inch display.</p>
<p>Both offer a razor-sharp Full HD+ display resolution, which is plenty of pixels whether you&rsquo;re into streaming TV shows from Netflix or blockbuster movies from Amazon Prime. Likewise, everything from your holiday snaps to your shameless selfies are likely to render in fantastic detail.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_19212" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-19212" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KyqK0jD08drdWbkFNLEvJre2azI_WiPuvbpY11fIHdkP4BKRMLFP7T_lbbGxvItvqY-H3or_BswPpT4wVhm12rBP=s0" alt="" width="600" height="338" /> Huawei Mate 20 Pro, IP68 certified and beach ready.[/caption]</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that &ndash;&nbsp;unless you&rsquo;re a massive tech-lover &ndash;&nbsp;you probably won&rsquo;t notice a major difference between the two screens. Then again, the slightly larger screen on the latest Huawei device may prove useful and it&rsquo;s certainly an upgrade.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>When it comes to cameras, Huawei has truly pulled it out of the bag on both fronts here.</p>
<p>The Huawei Mate 20 Pro has a 40MP lens, an ultra-wide angle 20MP lens, and an 8MP telephoto lens on the rear. The triple-lens setup is a rather impressive one. It should mean that you can take some professional-style pictures and will work for close-ups as well.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_19214" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-19214" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3GLC6NNhZYTnMXuXwVqzb7Kzja8dDSdoyeTIDsf0F7rfsuNc2bLaw2BhlqOWltHwyg4JfjDxIVZL6e4ywNRRsRL09g=s0" alt="" width="600" height="338" /> Huawei Mate 20 Pro, one of the best cameras in the business.[/caption]</p>
<p>The offering from the Huawei P20 Pro is pretty similar with a 40MP lens, a 20MP monochrome lens, and an 8MP telephoto lens. Both devices are set to beat the offering that&rsquo;s already on the market. There&rsquo;s also the AI enhanced stabilisation feature, which should make a real difference here too.</p>
<h2>Performance and Battery</h2>
<p>Sporting the brand-new Kirin 980 chip, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is one of the fastest devices out there at the moment.</p>
<p>The P20 Pro is now behind by one generation, packing the Kirin 970 instead. Of course, that means that the Mate 20 Pro is faster, however, when it comes to using either one, you should find that both are plenty quick enough for most of your everyday needs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19217" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mJZOuZFUUdOVehODlZnyXbsSgj02crDVtqnEYJAdxxVSRFZ9hdFrOLGIz8LuKWc9u3RLfidA7MqlES4a0h7F4qc=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to power, Huawei Mate 20 Pro needs a little more juice. That&rsquo;s because it features a bigger screen and more powerful processor. So, it makes sense that it packs a larger 4200 mAh battery, compared to 4000 mAh unit in the P20 Pro.</p>
<p>What's more, is the Mate 20 Pro can refuel 70% battery in just 30 minutes of charge time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19213" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w8IBhnurpDB8eLjAKQv1SLhq6CZTbdBtbnrIJyGL5SQsQOpvxJz6TyzORt4vpxwLgOAtgNuGvECZbKd6GPqjuQg=s0" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<h2>Extra Features</h2>
<p>Needless to say, both these Huawei mobiles boast top of the range features, including fingerprint scanners, AI-supported cameras, and an intuitive operating system. It&rsquo;s all high-tech stuff here. But the Huawei Mate 20 Pro raises the bar a little here with a few extra features.</p>
<p>3D Depth Sensing technology recognises your face to unlock the Mate 20 Pro. No fingerprint or passcode needed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19209" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UecgtDBLTh1MPAWwzMh390Ahi9lhhl7c6LdL4RhMfO3mXNCKJQ4fFRxJ2jUwqVeIl_UBHf3W6kM3OE7vMq_8TB2O=s0" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the option to boost the storage with the first ever Nano Memory card (which is even smaller than a microSD card) or use the slot for dual SIM cards.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s also the capability to charge other compatible phones and devices wirelessly using the back of the phone itself. You just place a phone to the back of the Huawei P20 Pro and get going! A-ma-zing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19222" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g_Zx-PB6fnGfiZzFfgNQWDud-0BcB1jMg2l-cHZNAgwrSlNWS325bzM2CePxeY_fUYEldXmwN-6YadrML1YEfRw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Prices and Availability</h2>
<p>Of course, the P20 Pro hit the shops back in March this year. The SIM free price is currently just &pound;669, while <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract deals start from as low as &pound;32 a month</a>, with nothing to pay upfront.</p>
<p>The Mate 20 Pro is currently available to pre-order SIM for &pound;899, or on contract from &pound;48 a month. Clearly, if you want the latest technology from Huawei, it&rsquo;s going to cost you a little extra.</p>
<p>Maybe this will sweeten the deal for you:</p>
<p>If you pre-order the Huawei Mate 20 Pro through Buymobiles.net before 26th October, you will be able to claim a free Huawei Watch GT and snazzy wireless charger. The two gadgets are worth a combined total of &pound;259, so it&rsquo;s a real steal.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If one thing&rsquo;s for sure, it&rsquo;s that Huawei is going from strength to strength these days. Both the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the P20 Pro are top of the range devices packing serious power and professional-style camera features to boot.</p>
<p>Of course, the latest device does offer a little more in the way of design, speed, and camera quality. So, if you&rsquo;re ready to upgrade, it might be the way to go. Then again, the P20 Pro is still one of the most advanced devices on the market. The choice is yours!</p>
