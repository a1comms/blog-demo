<p><span class="postStandFirst">October 2012 saw the launch of 4GEE, a super-fast network that brings data to your phone up to five times quicker than 3G.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5502 aligncenter" alt="EE - the UK's first 4G network" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/ee2-1024x644.jpg" width="960" height="603" /></p>
<p>The combining of the T-Mobile and Orange networks back in 2010, to form the Everything Everywhere brand, paved the way for the formation of the first 4G network, named 4GEE. The concept of which is to bring data transmissions nearly five times the speed of 3G data and, put simply, allowing the user to browse the web faster, download music in the blink of an eye and stream full HD movies without disruption.</p>
<p>In order to&nbsp;produce such speeds, 4GEE incorporates LTE technology (or Long Term Evolution to give it its correct name). This allows supported devices to connect to a higher data spectrum producing internet speeds that surpass even fixed-line broadband.</p>
<p>Data is the most frequently used aspect of smartphones these days. We use our phones more and more for social networking, listening to music, streaming movies and surfing the web, and 4GEE provides you with a mobile experience that allows you to do all of that at lightning speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Orange and T-Mobile customers due for upgrades can benefit from the fantastic deals and services of 4GEE, including the super speed data, tethering and EE films.&nbsp;</strong></p>
