<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Learn to WhatsApp like a boss, using these five, totally sweet tricks.</span></p>
<p>WhatsApp seems to be the chosen method for messaging friends, no doubt owing to its group chat facility and independence of mobile coverage. For me, it supplanted all other options some time ago.</p>
<p>The same could probably be said for WhatsApp&rsquo;s other 800 million users. Yet I&rsquo;m willing to wager that many of them aren&rsquo;t fully aware of the smorgasbord of tweaks, settings and little tricks available, to help optimise their WhatsApp experience.</p>
<p>But hey, I&rsquo;m not here to berate anyone for not swotting up on the finer intricacies of WhatsApp &ndash; because that&rsquo;s my job. I&rsquo;ve pulled together five of the most useful WhatsApp tips that I could find, omitting those that&rsquo;re wider known. So, read, enjoy and say sayonara to mismanaged messaging&hellip;</p>
<h2>1) Hide the &lsquo;last seen&rsquo; time</h2>
<p>For those who still like to maintain a degree of mystery &ndash; &nbsp;in a world where almost everything is shared through the public domain &ndash; you have the option to withhold your &lsquo;last seen&rsquo; time from your contacts.</p>
<p>To do so, head to <strong>Settings > Account > Privacy > Last Seen > </strong>set to<strong> Nobody</strong>. Boom &ndash; your privacy goes undisturbed for another day. But be aware, switching it off means that you won't be able to see your contacts' 'last seen' time&nbsp;any longer... Privacy&rsquo;s a two way street, buddy.</p>
<p>Whilst you&rsquo;re in your <strong>Privacy</strong> settings, you&rsquo;ll see the option to also conceal your profile photo and status, and whether you&rsquo;d like to turn read receipts off, too.</p>

<h2>2) Stop images auto-downloading</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure at some point you&rsquo;ve all had a friend ping an unsolicited image or two your way, some of which are just too lewd, or of too little interest to earn a spot in your photo album. So it pays to quash&nbsp;WhatsApp&rsquo;s irritating&nbsp;propensity to download and save received images, without any prompting.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings > Chat Settings ></strong> switch the <strong>Save Incoming Media</strong> toggle to the left. Or, cut the problem off at the source, by looking in <strong>Media Auto-Download</strong>, where you can prevent your phone from ever automatically downloading images, audio and videos.</p>

<h2>3) Protect&nbsp;your WhatsApp messages</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re especially concerned about a prying spouse, or your meddlesome children, you can wrap an extra blanket of security around WhatsApp by installing bespoke apps that&rsquo;ll protect your content.</p>
<p>Check out Google Play for various options like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatslock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lock for Whatsapp</a>, Lock for Whats Messenger and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enlightment.appslocker&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Lock</a>.</p>
<p>iPhone users can download apps like WhatsCode and Passcode for WhatsApp messages, though they won&rsquo;t password-protect WhatsApp, but will allow you to copy messages into them for safe keeping.</p>

<h2>4) Get WhatsApp on your computer</h2>
<p>Want to make weekend plans with your friends, whilst duping your boss into thinking you&rsquo;re blitzing through your weekly tasks? Get WhatsApp on your computer, by first installing <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a> (the web browser), followed by visiting <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp Web</a>.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;ll find some simple instructions to get your PC set up with WhatsApp, and you&rsquo;ll be good to go in no time. That&rsquo;s unless you own an iPhone&hellip; Sadly, iOS didn&rsquo;t make WhatsApp Web&rsquo;s guest list. For now.</p>

<h2>5) Use bold, italics and strikethrough</h2>
<p>You can enrich your WhatsApp banter with a new formatting update, bringing bold, italics and strikethrough into play.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no immediate reason why you might want to, but here&rsquo;s how anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Bold</strong> &ndash; add an asterisk (*) before and after the specific words you want to embolden. For example, *hello*.</p>
<p><em>Italics</em> &ndash; add an underscore (_) before and after the specific words you want to italicise. For example, _hello_.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Strikethrough </span>&ndash; add a tilde (~) before and after the specific words you want to strike through. For example, ~hello~.</p>
