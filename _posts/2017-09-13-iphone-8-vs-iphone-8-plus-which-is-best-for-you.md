<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We&rsquo;ve compared the new iPhone 8 models, so you don&rsquo;t have to.</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; In case you missed it, Apple made a rather <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/breaking-iphone-8-8-plus-and-iphone-x-are-finally-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant announcement</a> yesterday. The mega-brand will be bringing out not one, not two, but <em>three </em>new iPhones very soon. Of course, iPhone X alone was enough to drop jaws, but we&rsquo;ll get to that in another article.</p>
<p>For now, let&rsquo;s focus on iPhone 8 and 8 Plus - two stellar iPhones that improve massively on Apple&rsquo;s previous generations. If you want one of the new iPhones, but don&rsquo;t know which to choose, here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>In truth, there&rsquo;s not much difference between iPhone 8 and the larger 8 Plus. It was, in fact, iPhone X that got a complete overhaul in the looks department. These devices are more in line with Apple&rsquo;s more familiar design, with a few tweaks worth noting.</p>

<p>In place of the aluminium backs we had gotten used to, iPhone 8 an 8 Plus flaunt an ultra-tough, all-glass back. It may be odd to get your head around at first, but this is a style that really does work. It&rsquo;s a bit of a throwback to the gorgeous iPhone 4 design we all knew and loved.</p>
<p>The smaller iPhone 8 comes in at 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm, and is more practical for one-handed use. The larger iPhone 8 Plus, on the flip side, measures up at 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5 mm. The extra size does mean you&rsquo;ll often need to use two hands. But don&rsquo;t be concerned, you quickly get used it, and will wonder how lived without a bigger phone.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus may not boast the bezeless screen that Apple saved for iPhone X, but they&rsquo;re still very impressive all the same. iPhone 8 comes with a whopping 65.6% screen-to-body ratio, while iPhone Plus features a 67.7% screen-to-body ratio. It&rsquo;s fair to say that both offer lots of generous screen size to enjoy.</p>

<p>What about quality? Well, iPhone 8 packs a 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD screen with 326 pixels per inch (ppi). Understandably, the Plus model has a larger screen with higher specs, boasting a 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD screen with 401 ppi. So, you get plenty of detail from both, but an added helping on iPhone 8 Plus.</p>
<p>Both new iPhones have been treated to an upgrade in screen technology, with the addition of Dolby Vision and HDR10. That means that watching things on the likes of iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon will be better and more enjoyable than ever before. Winning.</p>
<h2>Chipset and Power</h2>
<p>One of yesterday&rsquo;s big reveals was the Apple A11 &lsquo;Bionic&rsquo; chipset - the very latest and greatest from the tech company. Luckily, <em>both</em> iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will run on said chip, which should mean you get a super speedy and reliable smartphone, that blasts through tasks, apps and whatever else you love doing. No lag here, just smooth sailing.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, Apple say that its 64-bit, six-core processors will help these new iPhones achieve 25% faster speeds than last year&rsquo;s iPhone 7 models. Always good to hear.</p>
<p>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus weren&rsquo;t born equals, so far as RAM goes, because iPhone 8 houses 2GB, whereas the Plus version outguns it with 3GB.</p>

<p>Since these iPhones are more powerful than ever before (<em>hell yeah!</em>), the good folk at Apple have increased the battery life too. Talk time on iPhone 8 comes in at around 14 hours, while you can expect around 21 hours from iPhone 8 Plus. Apple also introduced wireless charging for both, and claim that you can charge 50% of the battery in just 30 minutes. Bazinga!</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a snap-happy Apple fan, here&rsquo;s what you need to know: There&rsquo;s a couple of important differences between the cameras. The standard iPhone 8 has a 12-megapixel wide-angle sensor and a f/1.8 aperture, complete with a 5x digital zoom.</p>
<p>But outshining it is iPhone 8 Plus, with a 12-megapixel wide-angle f/1.8 lens, as well as second a telephoto f/2.8 lens. It has the ability to zoom digitally up to 10x, and optically (without compromising quality) 2x. This is smartphone cameras done right.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14944" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NFEXUcgU1r4eUr9GElCdC4VDBypdqvr78p_n8cZQ4ZDEPQ72CqN_0tOr_HIonaT3D7cBQ7yGDowSjp8pURMQe_MZ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Both phones house a A11 Bionic chip, though, which could make a huge difference here. It should make focussing in low-light faster and easier than ever, offer improved pixel processing power, and better noise reduction.</p>
<h2>Stereo Speakers</h2>
<p>Apple is literally turning up the volume on this one. Both iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have a new stereo speaker system, making them a massive 25% louder than iPhone 7 models. That really is a significant change. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the headphone jack is still missing from these phones. That means that fans who were praying for their speedy return will be disappointed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In many ways, iPhone 8 models are the logical next step for Apple. They improve on iPhone 7 specs and offer a better camera, wireless charging, a faster processor, and louder speakers. There&rsquo;s not much to fault here. However, the differences between iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are minor, though the Plus obviously has the bigger screen, as well as a better camera and longer battery life.</p>
<p>By now, most people have formed their allegiance to either the phone or phablet army, and so your choice really depends on your own size preference. Whichever you choose, you&rsquo;re guaranteed a sweet new smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are available to pre-order on 15 September.</strong></p>
