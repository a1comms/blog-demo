<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">As if out of nowhere, Huawei is now a household name. The Chinese mega company has been releasing awesome flagship phones for quite some time now, making it one of the leading players in the tech world. So what&rsquo;s all this fuss about the stunning new Huawei P10? Well, we take a look at everything you need to know about the phone. Enjoy.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Design: Curved and easy to handle</h3>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s deal with the massive elephant in the room. Yes, this phone does look strikingly similar to the iPhone 6. There&rsquo;s no way of getting around that fact. Most of the Huawei P10 reviews have been careful enough to skim around this point, but it really is something that you will notice in an instant. The new curved edges of the device make it look more Apple-esque than ever before, and you will also find that (from afar) the two phones could be easily mistaken.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there are a few unique design flairs here that you will notice the moment you touch it. The back of the phone is, of course, full metal, but there are a couple of variations here. For example, the so-called &lsquo;dazzling&rsquo; colour options offer a shiny, reflective effect which many phone lovers will adore. These phones use a 'Hyper Diamond Cut' finish which means, essentially, that they are shinier than ever and that they won&rsquo;t smudge when you hold them. On the other hand, the &lsquo;standard&rsquo; version of the phone is still impressive, offering a clean and crisp finish.</p>
<p>The takeaway? Well, the Huawei P10 is slick and snazzy. It comes in a range of colours including black, rose gold, silver, and even blue. Plus, you have the &lsquo;dazzling&rsquo; versions to boot. Still, the similarities between this device and the iPhone are undeniable, which may put some people off.</p>
<h3>Display: Bright and colourful</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, smartphone displays have come on leaps and bounds. To understand where the Huawei stands in the market, you need to know a little about its competitors. Both LG and Samsung&rsquo;s flagship phones now come with QHD panels. What&rsquo;s more, the latest Sony is a whopping 4K panel device. All of the above are much more powerful than that full HD display that comes on the standard Huawei P10.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a better quality screen but still want a Huawei, though, all is not lost. The Plus version of the phone comes with impressive QHD panels, which means that it&rsquo;s enough to rival the competition in a very real way. Still, both devices offer a bright and colourful display &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what really matters here.</p>
<p>While most smartphone manufacturers are opting for larger and larger screens, the people at Huawei have decided to take a step backwards. You may remember that the Huawei P9 had a reasonable 5.2-inch screen. Well, the P10 is smaller still, boasting a 5.1-inch screen. The difference is minor and most people won&rsquo;t notice it at all. The small size also means that the phone fits comfortably in the palm of your hand.</p>
<h3>Camera: Improved snapper with extras</h3>
<p>If the Huawei P10 has slacked a tad in other areas, the camera is where it really pulls things back. There are a bunch of improvements here, which are certain to delight users. The rear offering boasts a huge 20MP monochrome sensor, which works in sync with the 12MP colour lens. The sensor supposedly boost the detailing of each image you take, making them sharper and crisper than usual. Nice.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you&rsquo;re something of a selfie addict, you will adore the Leica Portrait and Beautification modes. Used together, these two improve facial tracking and help you to always show your best side no matter what. The rise of these style of features on modern smartphones seems to be a trend that won&rsquo;t be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<h3>Performance: Quick and easy experience</h3>
<p>As far as the chipset is concerned, it hasn&rsquo;t changed since the Huawei Mate 9. Yep, it&rsquo;s still the HiSilicon Kirin 960 chip that we saw in previous models. However, many users were content with the speed and performance of this one back then and there&rsquo;s no real reason that should have changed now. The device is also packing 4GB of RAM, which is more than enough right now. It offers a quick, slick system that will please most.</p>
<p>Sadly, if you&rsquo;re likely to run powerful games (such as Asphalt 8: Airborne), you may find that the graphics slow the device down somewhat. If you&rsquo;re using standard apps or games, such as Pokemon Go or Facebook, you will not have this issue. So, if you&rsquo;re a hardcore gamer, it may not be the phone for you. Otherwise, for daily use, you should have more than enough power here.</p>
<h3>Extra features: High security and navigation</h3>
<p>Security is a massive deal for modern-day smartphones, and with good reason. One of the biggest draws of the Huawei P10 is the ultra snazzy fingerprint scanner. It is just under the screen, but don&rsquo;t be fooled &mdash; this is not a button!</p>
<p>Aside from being used for security reasons, you can actually use the scanner&rsquo;s sensitivity to navigate between screens. At first, users may find this aspect of the phone hard to handle, but in time, it should be easy enough to use. The idea is that the device is highly sensitive and can detect small movements. That means that the user can flick between screens and modes in mere seconds. Different movements have different functions. For example, pushing down on the sensor for a second helps you navigate the interface, while to go back, you just need a quick tap.</p>
<h3>Price Tag and Availability</h3>
<p>So, when can you get your mitts on this device and, importantly, how much will it set you back? Well, the phone is actually already available here in the UK, which is great news if you like the sound of the snazzy new device. The price tag is a little steeper than previous models coming in at around &pound;569.99. However, it&rsquo;s worth comparing deals to see what you can get for yourself.</p>
