<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Rival the professionals, using just your mobile, with these five photo apps.</span></p>
<p>In a recent post, we asked the question of whether smartphones were likely to render the standalone camera obsolete, and the answer, surprisingly, was that they actually <em>might</em>.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s time to take a look at another feature that might give smartphones an edge over standalone cameras: apps.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/apps/the-top-ten-free-android-apps">apps</a> open up a whole new world of editing and sharing, all within one device, without ever having to use professional tools. And which apps are best? Well, we have a few ideas on that topic...</p>
<h2>1) Instagram</h2>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about photo apps, we <em>cannot</em> leave out Instagram; it&rsquo;s one of the most well-known photo-related apps on phones, and whether you&rsquo;re using an iPhone or an Android phone like the Samsung Galaxy S7, Instagram is the perfect way to share your photos online (or add filters to make them look like Polaroids from 1973, if you&rsquo;re that way inclined).</p>

<h2>2) Facetune</h2>
<p>When it comes to tweaking portrait photos (yes, including selfies), perhaps the most accomplished app out there is Facetune.&nbsp; Whether removing skin blemishes, filling in bald spots on your head, or gently modifying your face using the &ldquo;reshape&rdquo; tool (to add a smile <em>after</em> the photo&rsquo;s been taken), Facetune is a surprisingly powerful little app!</p>
<p><a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/Facetune.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10215" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/Facetune.jpg" alt="Facetune" width="600" height="346" /></a></p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3) VSCO Cam</h2>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re looking for something a little more in-depth, to edit your photos? Something that&rsquo;s a bit more like PhotoShop on your mobile phone?</p>
<p>Well you could of course use PhotoShop Express, or you could try out the utterly brilliant and completely free VSCO Cam. It can do most of the things PhotoShop Express can do, it&rsquo;s incredibly intuitive, and it even has its own photo sharing network, for you to publish your photos online!</p>
<p><a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/VSCO-Cam-Interface.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10216" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/VSCO-Cam-Interface.png" alt="VSCO Cam Interface" width="600" height="329" /></a></p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4) Slow Shutter Cam</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen what photos taken with a slow shutter look like; imagine a photo of a motorway, taken in a sort of almost time-lapse kind of way, where the headlights become beautiful, long light trails. That&rsquo;s traditionally been hard to do with mobile phones, but the Slow Shutter Cam will finally let you do it!</p>
<p><a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/ssc_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10217" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/ssc_4.jpg" alt="Slow Shutter Cam" width="600" height="447" /></a></p>

<h2>5) Flic</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to an area that you might not have considered: storage. If you&rsquo;re taking lots of photos, you&rsquo;re going to fill your phone up quite quickly, so what you need is a storage manager like Flic. With an interface similar to Tinder (swipe pics to delete them), it&rsquo;s a nicely intuitive way to manage the storage on your phone.<a href="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/Flic.jpeg"><br />
