<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The selfie game just changed!</span></p>
<p>Want to feel like you&rsquo;ve stepped in a time machine and been miraculously transported to the future? Imagine sliding your phone out of your pocket, pressing a button, and watching your case zap off into the air to take pictures for you. It might sound more like a James Bond toy than a real-life gadget, but it could soon be a reality.</p>
<p>A recent Kickstarter campaign has launched to bring the so-called SELFLY to the market. The team behind this wild creation, called SELFLY Camera, dub it, &ldquo;An autonomous flying phone case camera which is only 9mm (3/8in) thin and easily fits in your pocket.&rdquo; In simple terms, this is a case that actually gives your smartphone the power to fly, and take pictures along the way.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/selfly/selfly-camera-the-smart-flying-phone-case-camera/widget/video.html" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"> </iframe></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just another drone, right? Not quite. There&rsquo;s three important differences with SELFLY: it&rsquo;s much more streamlined (i.e. smooth and easy to navigate), way more affordable, AND IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOUR GOD DAMN PHONE FLY.</p>

<p>Before the creation of SELFLY, typically only your real tech-lovers were compelled to invest in a camera drone. Now, they&rsquo;re appealing to everyone.</p>
<p>To use this smartphone drone, all you need to do is &lsquo;snap&rsquo; it from the case, and start it up from the push of a button. SELFLY then takes off into the air, allowing you to take pictures from a range of angles and vantage points. It hovers autonomously, which means you&nbsp;can volley footballs at your little sister, and catch the entire thing on tape. Hands free.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves, though. It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that SELFLY is still very much in the development stage. If you&rsquo;re hoping to get one, you&rsquo;ll have to make a pledge via SELFLY Camera&rsquo;s Kickstarter page, then wait until they&rsquo;re released (probably June 2017).</p>
<p>For just $89 (or around &pound;70), you can nab an early bird deal. The team promises to send them to their pledgees &lsquo;anywhere in the world.&rsquo; The SELFLY will be compatible with &lsquo;all&rsquo; smartphones using a universal flip cover case. The following devices have their own dedicated case: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, and the Nexus 6.</p>
