<p><span class="postStandFirst">Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr, appears in a new advert, to explain why you should buy yourself an HTC One M8.</span></p>
<p><strong>HTC shocked the world when they announced that the star of the Iron Man movies, Robert Downey Jr, had become their new spokesperson, as part of a multi-million deal. Until now, though, he&rsquo;s only appeared in one HTC advert.</strong></p>

That situation has now changed, as he has appeared in a new commercial for the fantastic&nbsp;<strong>HTC One M8</strong>, a commercial which is now available to view on Youtube (above).</p>
<p>The most noticeable thing about the advert is that it&rsquo;s most definitely playing up Robert Downey Jr&rsquo;s current star image, plus there are&nbsp;<em>heavy</em>&nbsp;shades of Tony Stark in there, little tics that any fan of the Marvel movies will doubtless recognise. It&rsquo;s very likely that&rsquo;s not an accident, either; it&rsquo;s quite possible that HTC&rsquo;s thinking runs along the lines of, &ldquo;Look, folks, even&nbsp;<em>Iron Man</em>&nbsp;says this is the most amazing phone out there, and&nbsp;<em>he&rsquo;s Iron Man</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As has become increasingly apparent in the modern smartphone world, good marketing is a vital part of any phone&rsquo;s success (which is why Samsung has such stellar successes in the shape of phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5; their marketing blitz, whenever a new phone&rsquo;s released, is second-to-none), but talk has turned to whether this advert actually&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good marketing or not.</p>
<p>Some have called the advert cringe-worthy, which is definitely not the reaction HTC was going for, but for our money, there&rsquo;s definitely a charm to it, although most of it comes from RDJ&rsquo;s natural, easygoing charisma.</p>
<p>That latter part is almost&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;what HTC is counting on, in order to really push the HTC One M8 to prospective buyers.</p>
<p><strong>If the advert has worked its magic on you (after all, he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Iron Man), then you might want to check our out HTC One M8 video too... and order yourself one of these incredible new smartphones!</strong></p>
