<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This special edition Samsung Galaxy Note8 has made its way into every country's Winter Olympics team.</span></p>
<p>It's time once again to get excited for the Winter Olympics, taking place this time in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9th to 25th February 2018.</p>
<p>We for one are very excited for it, who doesn&rsquo;t want to see athletes hurling themselves off a 120-meter ski jump?</p>
<p>To tickle your interest, here's the cool animation for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, featuring the official mascot, Soohorang, a white tiger. Who, as you'll see, is pretty boss at every sport.</p>

<p>With the build-up to the world event now gaining traction, we have another reason to get excited.</p>
<p>Our friends at Samsung recently announced a special edition of the Samsung Galaxy Note8.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16432" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jj6tpX8AiVwOzW9DUCqE81yF1yo1b8stj1tR2xxefdCGiieIomni79z5i8dzmKfuZgR3qJeAr9IaR539ZQjGjtvK=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Been Added to the Olympic Note8?</h2>
<p>A few aesthetic features have been added, a beautiful white glass back, complete with embossed gold Olympic Rings. As expected, you also get the matching white S-Pen, which looks very smart indeed.</p>
<p>Another subtle little extra is that the Galaxy Note8 comes pre-loaded with PyeongChang 2018 themed wallpapers.</p>
<p>The special edition phone will be presented to those competing in the Paralympic games too, each with an exclusive case featuring the Paralympic's logo.</p>
<p>Younghee Lee, CMO and Executive Vice President at Samsung Electronics, commented in <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-pyeongchang-2018-olympic-games-limited-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung&rsquo;s official announcement</a> stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re proud to provide the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Games Limited Edition to all athletes in an effort to help them to stay connected, capture and share one of the most memorable moments of their lives.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aside from these extra features, you still get the usual powerful and beautiful Galaxy Note 8 phone. Complete with its huge 6.3-inch Quad HD screen, with high quality colour reproduction, an amazing&nbsp;12-megapixel dual lens main camera, for superior Insta pics, and a powerful performance from its advanced technology.</p>

<h2>How Do You Get Your Hands on One?</h2>
<p>Hard luck mobile fans, this version of the smartphone has been specifically made for the Olympic teams and staff members involved in the games.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to be sniffed at though, Samsung will be supplying over 4,000 of these devices.</p>
<p>Who would turn down the opportunity for this kind of exposure on the world stage? And of course, on Samsung's home turf.</p>
