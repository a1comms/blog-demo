<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Super-powerful smartphones are everywhere nowadays, but there&rsquo;s a type of device&nbsp;that&rsquo;s much, much rarer. We&rsquo;re talking, of course, about <em>tough</em> smartphones, phones that can withstand the elements, that can survive a dip&nbsp;in the sea, or, in extreme cases, could headbutt their way <em>through</em> Burma.</span></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s &ldquo;through&rdquo; in the same of &ldquo;clean through the bedrock&rdquo;, naturally...</p>
<p>But which are the best? Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2><strong>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact</strong></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with one that doesn&rsquo;t fit the <em>whole</em> definition of a &ldquo;tough phone&rdquo;, but which is nonetheless one of the most well-known waterproof phones on the market, the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact. Reckoned by some to be the best higher-mid-range phones on the market, it has bags of power, a beautiful 4.6-inch 720p screen, a 23MP camera, and a water-resistant body to keep everything nice and safe if it goes for a dip.</p>

<h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy S7</strong></h2>
<p>In the same vein, the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> is a more traditional sleek smartphone, that has been taken more towards the tough end of the spectrum by the cunning application of water and dust-resistance. We&rsquo;ve gone into what makes it such an amazing phone before (insanely fast processor, 5.1-inch Quad-HD screen, 12MP Dual Pixel camera), but to see all that power wrapped up in a water-resistant body is glorious.</p>
<p>Both of those, however, are smartphones that tend towards being a little bit toughened, through resistance to the elements. Now it&rsquo;s time to meet the <em>proper</em> hardcases, the kind where drop-testing them may leave a crater...</p>

<h2><strong>Sonim XP7</strong></h2>
<p>Do you remember the JCB phones that went on sale a few years ago? This author certainly does, since he tried to prove how tough one was by hitting himself in the head with it, which in hindsight, was really rather stupid...</p>
<p>Well those JCB phones were actually made by a company called Sonim, and Sonim still makes tough phones to this day. The Sonim XP7 is their take on a smartphone, and it takes toughness to a new degree, with an IP69 rating (meaning it&rsquo;s dust- and waterproof, to a higher degree than those first two phones on the list), and if it&rsquo;s made using the same techniques as those first JCB phones, then it has a solid metal frame.</p>
<p>Essentially, if waterproofing is elemental resistance, then the body of the XP7 is basically power armour. It may not be as powerful as other phones on this list, nor does it have as impressive a screen, but for toughness, few phones can match it...</p>

<h2><strong>Kyocera DuraForce</strong></h2>
<p>Next up, we come to a phone from a lesser-known manufacturer: the Kyocera DuraForce. It&rsquo;s not quite as waterproof as the Sonim XP7 (although it has a better 720p screen and a faster processor), but it brings a new feature into the mix, namely a certification known as MIL-STD-810G; in other words, it&rsquo;s resistant to salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport and thermal shock.</p>
<p>Oh, and that MIL-STD code? That means US Military Standard, so what we have here is a phone as tough as gear used by the American army!</p>

<h2><strong>CAT S60</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, we come to a phone that, to my&nbsp;mind, brings <em>everything</em> together, the CAT S60. It has MIL-STD-810G certification. It&rsquo;s waterproof down to 2m (and if you flip the lockdown switch, down to 5m). It can take photos underwater. Its screen is even usable underwater, which is very, very rare indeed.</p>
<p>It also has a 4.7-inch 720p screen, a surprisingly fast processor and 3GB of RAM. Even better, though, is the CAT S60&rsquo;s party trick; in addition to the 13MP camera, it also has a proper, full-on, infra-red thermal imaging camera on the back, so you can use it for useful things like checking wires for thermal load, or stupid things like pretending you&rsquo;re the Predator after you&rsquo;ve been to the pub...</p>
<p>Put simply, the CAT S60 is the apex of what is currently possible with tough phones, and as a result, it&rsquo;s glorious.</p>

<p><strong>All of this raises a question, however: if tough phones are currently this good, then where do they go from here? What more could possibly be done to make them more amazing? Frankly, we have no idea, but we know one thing: it&rsquo;s going to be really interesting finding out... </strong></p>
