<p><span class="postStandFirst">Is it possible to pick out one of the currently available smartwatches as the best? Join us as we take a look at three of the latest and greatest smartwatches, and weigh them up against each other to see if we can answer that question. Which is the best looking? Which will last the longest between charges? Which is the most <i>powerful</i>? Let&rsquo;s find out!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4859" alt="smartwatches" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/DSC_1125-1024x576.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></p>
<p>In 2014, we&rsquo;ve seen a whole new type of device really come into its own, to such an extent that pretty much all of the big manufacturers are working on their variant of the technology; that type of device is, of course, the smartwatch.</p>
<p>There are a range of smartwatches already available, but can we pick out one of them and say, &ldquo;<i>This is the best</i>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we&rsquo;ve rounded up three of the most popular and well-known smartwatches on the market, to pit them against each other in a three-way battle royale, and see which one comes out on top. So, in one corner, we have the Samsung Gear 2, Samsung&rsquo;s second -generation smartwatch, for use with the company&rsquo;s Galaxy phones. In another corner, we have the Sony SmartWatch 2, designed to be used with the Xperia range of phones.</p>
<p>And finally, rounding out the group, we have the new LG G Watch, running the brand new, cut-down version of Google&rsquo;s smartphone platform, Android Wear.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s get this show on the road!</p>
<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4860" alt="smartwatches" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/DSC_1133-1024x576.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption">Premium, interchangeable straps</span></p>
<p>Even more than with smartphones, the look of a smartwatch is a vitally important thing. After all, while your Samsung Galaxy S5 or your HTC One M8 may spend a lot of its life in your pocket, or while your LG G3 might even spend its entire life in a case, a smartwatch is on display all the time you&rsquo;re wearing it.</p>
<p>So, which of the three smartwatches is best? We&rsquo;re going to have to go with the Samsung Gear 2, because while the LG G Watch is 5g lighter, the Samsung is water-resistant. The Sony is of course also water-resistant, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s almost double the weight of the LG and the Samsung.</p>
<p>Thus the Samsung Gear 2 offers the best mix of water resistance <i>and</i> light weight, so it wins this first round (and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that it&rsquo;s gorgeous to look at, too)!</p>
<h2><b>Useful/Desirable Features</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4861" alt="smartwatches" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/DSC_1136-576x1024.jpg" width="346" height="614" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption">Samsung Gear 2 in action</span></p>
<p>And so, we move on to the second round, and things get interesting here, as the Samsung Gear 2 has a 2MP camera built into the strap. However, is that more impressive than fact that the LG G Watch uses Android Wear?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d argue that it isn&rsquo;t, because Android Wear is really, <i>really</i> nice to use! With tight integration to Google Now, and a ton of APIs that make it easy for developers to integrate features from their apps into the Android Wear experience, we&rsquo;d say that the inclusion of Google&rsquo;s cut-down wearable platform is a far more appealing feature.</p>
<p>Therefore, the LG G Watch wins round 2!</p>
<h2><b>Battery Life</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4862" alt="smartwatches" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/DSC_1122-1024x576.jpg" width="576" height="324" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption">LG G Watch and its charging plate</span></p>
<p>And so, we come to the final round, and it&rsquo;s something else that, while already important on smartphones, is absolutely, vitally crucial on smartwatches: battery life (because taking your watch off every night to charge it is a bit of an encumbrance).</p>
<p>The LG G Watch is ruled out straight away, because it uses a Snapdragon 400 processor, and while that makes it the fastest, most <i>powerful</i> smartwatch on this list, the compromise is that its battery life is the lowest. Meanwhile, you can feasibly get just over two days out of the Samsung Gear 2, but the big winner in this category is the Sony SmartWatch 2: if you&rsquo;re careful with how hard you use it, you could feasibly get four days out of the battery, way ahead of its rivals.</p>
<p>Naturally, that means that the Sony SmartWatch 2 wins round 3!</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>In conclusion, it would appear that we have a draw on our hands, here, with each smartwatch excelling at something different. As with phones, the best watch on the market depends on what <i>you</i> want from it.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a feature-packed, powerful watch, albeit one with a low battery life, get the LG G Watch; if you want a gorgeous, lightweight smartwatch that&rsquo;s also water-resistant, get the Samsung Gear 2; and if you want a premium smartwatch with a nice long battery life, even if it&rsquo;s a little heavier than its rivals, get the Sony SmartWatch 2.</strong></p>
