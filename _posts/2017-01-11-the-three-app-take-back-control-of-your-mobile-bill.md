<p>In this day and age, we don&rsquo;t want to call someone to solve a problem. Even logging on to our PC and browsing the web can be a stretch. What we want, is to manage our lives quickly and conveniently, with minimal exertion, and how better to do it than from our smartphone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different when it comes to managing our mobile phone bill. In fact, of all of life&rsquo;s little details, that&rsquo;s surely the one that should <em>always</em> be taken care of from a smartphone. Right?</p>
<p>(You can see where this is going&hellip;)</p>
<p>Well, the team at Three agrees with this mantra 100%. So much so, that the Muppet-loving network only went and built an app for that very purpose, an app that gives you complete control of your phone bill from, you guessed it, your phone.</p>

<p>Totally free to download, of course, the Three app covers everything from your usage, to your billing, to your plan details. It even goes as far as to provide some help and support, in the form of informative content.</p>
<h2>What You&rsquo;ve Used</h2>
<p>Usage checks show you how much data, minutes and texts you&rsquo;ve got through, and how much you&rsquo;ve got left until your allowance resets. No nasty surprises.</p>

<h2>Manage Your Money</h2>
<p>Get a view on your last 12 months&rsquo; worth of bills and charges, so you can track exactly how much you&rsquo;re spending throughout your contract.</p>

<h2>Your Plan</h2>
<p>Check your plan details, change your payment date and find out when you&rsquo;re due to upgrade, all without leaving the Three app.</p>
