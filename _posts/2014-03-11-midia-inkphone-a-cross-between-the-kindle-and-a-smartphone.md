<p><span class="postStandFirst">A long time ago, Motorola tried to sell the world on a phone with an e-ink screen. It was called the Motorola MOTOFONE F3, and although it didn&rsquo;t sell to well, the concept was very intriguing. Well now, someone else is having a go at making a phone with an e-ink screen...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3359/13083426353_e26b56539f.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>That company is Onyx, and the phone in question is the MIDIA Inkphone.</p>
<p>The first point to make is that, as you might expect, the specs of the Inkphone aren&rsquo;t exactly going to set the world alight. It has a 4.3-inch screen (the same size as the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact or the HTC One Mini), but you&rsquo;ll note that we haven&rsquo;t mentioned the screen resolution, there. That&rsquo;s because the Inkphone defies classical &ldquo;new phone write-up&rdquo; standards, by only using an e-ink screen. As such, it looks more like an e-reader than a smartphone, in spite of the fact it runs on Android.</p>
<p>Onyx says that this screen, which doesn&rsquo;t use power when it&rsquo;s not updating itself, will give the Inkphone a standby time of&nbsp;<em>two weeks</em>, and based on how long the batteries last in Kindle readers, we can believe it!</p>
<p>However, it remains a curiosity, because despite running on Android, it doesn&rsquo;t have access to the Google Play Store, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly good at running apps, even if it&nbsp;<em>did</em>.</p>
<p><strong>As yet, there&rsquo;s no word on when (or even&nbsp;<em>if</em>) the Inkphone will make it out of Poland and Germany, to reach the UK.</strong></p>
