<p>Google Play Music is, for lack of a better phrase, bang tidy.</p>
<p>With a catalogue of over 35 million tracks, access to music videos via YouTube Red and the ability to cast music to your stereo and TV, you&rsquo;d think that kind of service would drain your bank account. But you&rsquo;d be mistaken.</p>
<p>Google Play Music&rsquo;s bountiful features can be yours, for a quarter of the year, all for just &pound;1. Post Brexit, that&rsquo;s about 20p, right?</p>
<p>Usually &pound;9.99 per month, this amazing entertainment streaming service is a must-have for any music-lover, but for anyone yet to sign up to it, Google is giving you the opportunity to enjoy an entire three months at an absolute steal.</p>
<p>Google does offer some incredible services, amongst the best is definitely Google Play Music. It gives Android and iOS users the option of a free, basic service, whilst the full, &lsquo;All Access&rsquo; one comes at a premium. But not right now it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this limited-time offer, and stream your favourite tunes at near to no cost, just head over to Google Play Music and sign up.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to cancel after the three months are up, of course, as the normal fee of &pound;9.99 a month will apply. No doubt you&rsquo;ll love Google Play Music so much you won&rsquo;t care.</strong></p>
