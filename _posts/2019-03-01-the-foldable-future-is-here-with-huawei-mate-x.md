<h2>Screen Flexibility</h2>
<p>Flexy is its middle name!</p>
<p>Folding outwards, Huawei Mate X is among the first smartphones to offer a phone-to-tablet design.</p>
<p>Working from a precision-engineered hinge, the Mate X has been designed to collapse flush onto itself, sporting a look that is both beautiful and practical.</p>

<h2>All Screen View</h2>
<p>So, when you&rsquo;ve done using your device in its standard phone size, expand into the tablet look in an instant to get an edge-to-edge viewing experience.</p>
<p>This view primarily gives you more space to play with, whether its a box set binge, or sharing your holiday snaps with a group of friends, enjoy an immersive 8-inch foldable FullView Huawei display, with bright OLED colour.</p>

<h2>Multitask Like a Boss</h2>
<p>Huawei Mate X is designed to make multitasking your new best friend.</p>
<p>Easily divide your screen in half and work simultaneously side-by-side with Split Screen mode. Drag, drop, search and watch, oh the possibilities!</p>
<h2>Super Powerful</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy 5G speeds on Mate X with a host of other amazing under-the-hood gear.</p>
<p>Gaming and video streaming won&rsquo;t be a problem, thanks to a rapid Kirin 980 processor for efficient and uninterrupted use.</p>
<p>Added internal components mean the device remains at top form when running the next generation of internet, with the handset's 5G chipset, named Balong 5000.</p>
<h2>Intelligent Cameras</h2>
<p>With their position and design, the Mate X cameras are perfect for taking selfies and everyday camera use.</p>
<p>Both the front and rear cameras are packed with Leica camera technology which will always catch your best side.</p>
<p>On Mate X, you&rsquo;ll be able to see what&rsquo;s in shot on both sides of the screen thanks to Mirror shooting. Snap your best portraits or group selfies yet with this handy display feature.</p>

<h2>Super-Charged</h2>
<p>Mate X has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that is integrated into the power button, meaning you can get secure access to the good stuff simultaneously.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be left wanting in the battery department either. Mate X comes with a large 4500 mAh battery, meaning you&rsquo;ll have loads of phone time.</p>
<p>When your Mate X is running low on juice, you can easily top up with Huawei SuperCharge tech. This can get upto 85% of charge in 30 minutes, depending on the conditions.</p>
<h2>Prices and Release Date</h2>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no word on a UK release yet from Huawei, the device is likely to launch mid-2019.</p>
<p>The Mate X has a price tag of around &pound;2000, making for one tastily priced device. However, for those who want the latest and best tech, it&rsquo;s more likely a must-have choice!</p>
