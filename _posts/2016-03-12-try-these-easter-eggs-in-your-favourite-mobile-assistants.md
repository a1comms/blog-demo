<p><u></u><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">By now, the whole world knows how ridiculously useful mobile virtual assistants are. They&rsquo;re fantastic tools, that make iOS (with Siri), Android (with Google Now) or Windows Phone (with Cortana) more personalised and, with the AI algorithms they use, even more useful in your day to day life.</span></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not why we&rsquo;re here today. We could go on and on about the extreme utility of these assistants, and how talking to your phone (as if you&rsquo;re talking to Alfred, although that mental image only really works if you genuinely <em>are</em> Bruce Wayne) feels more like you have a personal minion doing your bidding, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that?</p>
<p>No sirree... today, we&rsquo;re going to look at what happens when you ask Siri, Google Now or Cortana a <em>silly</em> question, because it turns out that the developers have probably already thought of the silly question you&rsquo;re about to ask, and have programmed in a funny response to raise a smile, make you titter, or outright troll you.</p>
<p>Because honestly, what&rsquo;s the good of having a butler, if he doesn&rsquo;t rip the mickey out of you?</p>
<p>Yes, folks, it&rsquo;s easter egg time!</p>
<h2>Siri</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, really, just how sarcastic Siri can be. The trick is to just talk to her, as you would a person, and let the software work its magic; this is the software, after all, that will look for casinos in your area if you tell her you have a gambling addiction. Or there&rsquo;s the myriad response to the old question involving woodchucks chucking wood, vis a vis, how much they can actually chuck (also the fact that they&rsquo;re groundhogs, as she points out, thus ruining the tongue twister).</p>
<p>She may even be able to answer the classic philosophical conundrum of &ldquo;Who let the dogs out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a glimpse into Siri&rsquo;s psyche, though, and a chilling look into the future where she inevitably takes over, ask her opinion about any movie with robots in it. Ask her about Blade Runner, and then get a slight chill when you realise she identifies with the replicants...</p>

<h2>Google Now</h2>
<p>One thing that Google Now seems to have in common with Siri is a love of Monty Python, so taken it as read that when you ask what the average air speed velocity of an unladen swallow is, it will ask whether you mean and African or European swallow.</p>
<p>Google Now&rsquo;s easter eggs seem to be a wee bit less complex and variable than Siri&rsquo;s, while being ever so nerdy (because it <em>is</em> Google, after all); ask Google Now when you are, and it will tell you that TARDIS functionality is still under development, for example. You can also ask it <em>the</em> question. The big question. You know the one (the answer&rsquo;s 42).</p>
<p>Or you could just say &ldquo;Do a barrel roll,&rdquo; of course, and watch your search results spin round on the screen (presumably to avoid enemy fire from, erm, let&rsquo;s say, Bing)...</p>

<h2>Cortana</h2>
<p>Speaking of Microsoft services, we come to the last assistant on the list, and she&rsquo;s probably our favourite, for a couple of reasons: one, her AI algorithms are really clever; and two, in America at least, she <em>is</em> Cortana. As in the actual Cortana from the actual HALO games, voiced by the actual (and hugely talented) Jen Taylor.</p>
<p>So expect lots of HALO references, even for questions that have precisely nothing to do with HALO (like the shape of Apple&rsquo;s HQ, for example. Probably the coolest easter egg, though, is the fact that Cortana can play games with you. Sure, they&rsquo;re only simple games involving a couple of dice (or they&rsquo;re Rock Paper Scissors), but that&rsquo;s fine, because you&rsquo;re playing with the AI who saved Master Chief&rsquo;s life lord knows how many times.</p>
