<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">They say a GIF is worth a thousand words.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pain we all know too well. You&rsquo;ve got something to say when commenting on someone&rsquo;s Facebook status, but somehow, you just can&rsquo;t find the right words. In those moments, what you need is a GIF.</p>
<p>Up until now, commenting on Facebook with GIFs was a mere dream; something we all hoped would happen, but feared never would. Well, luckily, your prayers have been answered. Yes, as of right now, you can add these moving images to just about every comment you post on Facebook.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10155918219781729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, you can never get good news without a small side helping known as a catch. Eek. Before you start gleefully posting GIFs on Facebook until your heart&rsquo;s content, there are a couple of things that you need to know. It might not be as easy as you imagine right away.</p>
<p>If, for example, you have a favourite GIF in mind, finding it through Facebook&rsquo;s GIF library might be hard. Pros know that you can post a URL from the likes of GIPHY as your status, to pull through a particular GIF. But comments won&rsquo;t work the same. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be limited to the search function in the comment box.</p>
<p>What that means is that, yes, you will be able to post GIFs as comments when the urge takes you, however, your choice may be somewhat limited. Your best bet is to search with a GIF in mind and keep scrolling until you find it. It may be a hassle, but hey, GIFs are worth it.</p>
<h2>How to Comment with a GIF on Facebook</h2>
<p>1) Find an amazing Facebook post (like the one below) and click Comment. Then, select the GIF option.</p>

<p>2) Finally, search for and select a GIF. It&rsquo;s that easy!</p>

<p>Of course, this latest Facebook feature is certain to be a massive hit. Last year alone, Facebook users exchanged a whopping 13 billion GIFs via Messenger. It&rsquo;s clear to see that people love using these moving images as a way to get their message across. So, go on, GIF-GIF away&hellip;</p>
