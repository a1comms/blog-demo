<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Let Bixby do it.</span></p>
<p>Galaxy Home has been announced as Samsung&rsquo;s first smart home speaker, powered by Bixby. This comes as no surprise, with leading smartphone manufacturers having already released their own versions, such as <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/apple-homepod-vs-amazon-echo-vs-google-home-which-is-the-best-smart-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple HomePod, Google Home and Amazon&rsquo;s Echo</a>.</p>
<p>At the recent Samsung Unpacked event, the Galaxy Home was unveiled along with the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-samsung-galaxy-note-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Galaxy Note 9</a>, among other next-gen Samsung products.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Home: Design</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt, the Samsung Galaxy Home has a space-age design, with its shuttle style, three-pronged legs.</p>
<p>Although there's no confirmation yet, its size could be another distinguishing factor, looking more like a rival in scale to the HomePod (6.8-inches) rather than a Google Home (5.6-inches). Some say the smart speaker resembles a witch's cauldron, with its rounded base and flat top, we however think that's a bit harsh and it in fact looks modern and futuristic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find the Galaxy Home buttons positioned at the top of the device, no doubt where you can change volume and skip tracks. Generally, its smart and subtle vase shape looks quite attractive, Samsung may even release it in more colours than just black so we can easily match our home decor.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Home: Bixby</h2>
<p>Recent updates to the Bixby AI assistant (version 2.0) means it will be a lot more intelligent than before, engaging better with event dates and query commands.</p>
<p>Based on the Unpacked presentation, Bixby will be able to control your music for you too, as well as all the little things you usually ask Bixby to do on your smartphone.</p>
<p>That's right, Bixby is also available on Samsung&rsquo;s other latest handsets, like the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/best-samsung-galaxy-deals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S9, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8</a>.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Home: Music</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely the Galaxy Home will give an audio masterclass too. Samsung purchased Harman and AKG (the speaker specialists) not too long ago, so there&rsquo;s high promise here. Not only that, at the Unpacked event, the Galaxy Home was played in by multiple Galaxy Home devices to show its music prowess.</p>
<p>Based on the introduction we got at Unpacked, the Galaxy Home has a pretty good spec on paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll have six speakers and a subwoofer, capable of surround sound. Eight microphones pick up your commands for Bixby Voice from further away.</p>
<p>Samsung also announced a partnership with Spotify at its Unpacked event. This likely means the device will be Spotify ready, prepped to play out all your bangers!</p>
<p>So, whether it&rsquo;s dance anthems or classical orchestra, Galaxy Home seems like it will make anything sound awesome.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Home: Smart Home</h2>
<p>Although Samsung is remaining pretty tight lipped about <em>all</em> the capabilities of its smart speaker, it&rsquo;s anticipated that the device will be able to control more than just music and Bixby.</p>
<p>An impressive feature will be its SoundSteer technology. Simply talking to your Galaxy Home will optimise it to the space it&rsquo;s in, directing sound towards you.</p>
<p>Although, Samsung only alluded to in its smart speaker unveiling, according to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Central</a>, it&rsquo;s thought that it will be able to control other smart products in your home too, like your fridge or lighting.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Home: Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>The recent Unpacked event saw the Galaxy Home in all its glory, but really, just as a teaser. Unfortunately, though, there&rsquo;s no indication of a release date just yet.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as ours when it comes to the cost too. If there is any truth in the &lsquo;high-end&rsquo; rumours around this smart speaker, it could very well be in the same cost bracket as an <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/how-to-use-apples-new-homepod-smart-speaker-like-a-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple HomePod</a>&nbsp;(around &pound;319.00).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll find out more on November 7<sup>th</sup> 2018 in San Francisco. This will be Samsung&rsquo;s next big event, so watch this space.</p>
