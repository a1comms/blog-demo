<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Let there be WiFi&hellip; *poof*</span></p>
<p>Saving your 4G data is no laughing matter. We all know the drill by now. Whenever you&rsquo;re somewhere with WiFi, you want to connect to it. Duh. Otherwise, flicking through your Instagram feed could quickly eat up your data.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s something a little awkward about having to ask your friend for their WiFi password when you&rsquo;re at their house. Although, deep down in your heart, you know there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with using their internet, it just feels a bit cheeky.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid an uncomfortable social interaction (who doesn&rsquo;t?), Apple may well have the answer. Yes, with the upcoming <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank">iOS 11 update</a>, you&rsquo;ll be able to use your pal&rsquo;s WiFi without even saying a word. Instead, you can digitally request the password through a new feature called WiFi Sharing.</p>
<h2>How Does WiFi Sharing Work?</h2>
<p>So, how will this mystical new WiFi Sharing feature work? The idea is to make the whole process much easier, cutting out unnecessary hassle.</p>
<p><strong>1) Hold your iPhone near another iOS device </strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a friend&rsquo;s house and they have an iOS device that is already using the WiFi, you can hold your phone near their device to request access.</p>

<p><strong>2) Pull up the WiFi login screen </strong></p>
<p>Next, pull up the WiFi login screen and click the WiFi button as you usually would when connecting to a network.</p>
<p><strong>3) Wait for permission </strong></p>
<p>Your friend will then get a notification asking to send you their WiFi password over-the-air. Yes, that means that they don&rsquo;t even need to tell you what the password is.</p>
<p><strong>4) Accept the transfer</strong></p>
<p>You get the option to accept the transfer, confirm and the password field will automatically be filled. After that, you can start using the WiFi network until your heart&rsquo;s content!</p>
<p>WiFi Sharing will be available on the iOS 11 update, which officially launches in autumn this year, along with a whole load of other extras including the ability to delete pesky apps and new memory options.</p>
