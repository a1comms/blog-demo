<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Who will win as the Chinese mobile brands lock horns?</span></p>
<p>This week, the good people over at OnePlus launched its latest smartphone &ndash;&nbsp;the slick OnePlus 6T. It&rsquo;s caused quite a stir. So, we thought we&rsquo;d pit it against another of the latest flagship phones, the Huawei Mate 20. Which is better? Let&rsquo;s take a look and find out.</p>
<h2>OnePlus 6T vs. Huawei Mate 20: Design</h2>
<p>With slightly curved edges and a cool design, it&rsquo;s hard to find much fault with the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/oneplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 6T</a>. The device boasts glass on either side and has been created so that it&rsquo;s perfectly palm-sized at 157.5 x 74.8 x 8.2mm. There&rsquo;s a small notch at the top and a slim chin at the bottom. On the back, there&rsquo;s the camera lenses and nothing more. The fingerprint scanner has now relocated to deep inside the screen. Oh, and it comes in two colours: black or black. (Okay, mirror black or midnight black, but you get the point.)</p>
<p>Equally simplistic and beautiful, in terms of design, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/mate-20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei Mate 20</a> isn&rsquo;t an entirely different offering. The all-screen look is wonderful and works remarkably well, while there are three lenses on the back, which fit a small grid. There&rsquo;s also a small notch at the top of the screen, but it&rsquo;s not large enough to cause you any trouble. To cut a long story short, it&rsquo;s a great looking piece of technology and fits with the minimal ethos of modern smartphones.</p>

<h2>OnePlus 6T vs. Huawei Mate 20: Display</h2>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s talk size. There&rsquo;s not much between these two flagship devices. The OnePlus 6T boasts a 6.41-inch screen, while the Huawei Mate 20 offers a 6.39-inch screen. We&rsquo;re talking a 0.02 inches difference here. It&rsquo;s truly not a major deal.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to screen quality, you might find that the two devices offer different deals. The OnePlus 6T comes in with Optic AMOLED, while the Huawei Mate 20 has an OLED screen. The latter also comes in with a higher resolution at 1440 x 3120 pixels. On the other hand, the OnePlus 6T boasts 1080 x 2280 pixels. But, in simple terms, it's still a very close race.</p>

<h2>OnePlus 6T vs. Huawei Mate 20: Camera</h2>
<p>The Huawei Mate 20 offers a serious setup when it comes to the camera. The triple-lens offering is about as impressive as it gets these days. It&rsquo;s clear to see why there&rsquo;s been so much hype surrounding the device. On the rear, you&rsquo;ve got a 12, 8, and 16-megapixel combination, which is quite remarkable. To add to that, the front &lsquo;selfie&rsquo; camera is a huge 24-megapixel. All in all, it&rsquo;s an awesome offering.</p>
<p>So, can the OnePlus 6T compete? The device packs a 16-megapixel sensor combined with a 20-megapixel lens. There&rsquo;s also the Nightscape mode feature, which helps you to take awesome low-light pictures. Most photography fans will be pleased with that. Plus, there&rsquo;s the Studio Lighting feature that helps people to take great portrait photos.</p>

<h2>OnePlus 6T vs. Huawei Mate 20: Power and Storage</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get down to the nitty, gritty details. What power and storage will each of these devices offer you?</p>
<p>The OnePlus 6T certainly has an impressive starting point. With a decent enough 3700 mAh battery, you shouldn't have any problems when it comes to battery life. Add that to a RAM offering of upto 8GB and 128GB ROM, there&rsquo;s a whole lot to love here.</p>
<p>Looking at what Huawei Mate 20 has under the hood, you'll find a whopping 4000 mAh battery setup, 4GB RAM (a little less than the OnePlus) and 128GB ROM. While there&rsquo;s not much between the two devices here, these minor variations may be enough to sway you one way or another.</p>

<h2>OnePlus 6T vs. Huawei Mate 20: Performance</h2>
<p>When the Huawei Mate 20 was released, the powers behind it had quite a massive claim to make. Dubbing it the 'fastest Android phone on the market', they revealed that it would run on the octa-core Kirin 980 processor. Whether the device will live up to that rather epic title remains to be seen. However, there&rsquo;s no denying the fact that it&rsquo;s a super fast phone. It also runs the latest Android 9 operating system as well.</p>
<p>But wait, what about the OnePlus 6T? Well, the device just so happens to runs the top-of-the range Qualcomm Snapdragon 845. It&rsquo;s also a fast setup and should be enough to please most tech fans out there. When it comes to the operating system, you&rsquo;ve got a version of Android 9, which the OnePlus company has tweaked with its OxygenOS overlay.</p>
