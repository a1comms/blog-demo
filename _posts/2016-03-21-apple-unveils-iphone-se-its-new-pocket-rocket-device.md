<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple has announced a smaller addition to its iPhone family, called iPhone SE. Whilst it&rsquo;s more compact, it doesn&rsquo;t compromise on performance. It's "the most powerful 4-inch phone in the world."</span></p>
<p>Apple once again managed to pull a fast one on us, unveiling&nbsp;its new &lsquo;iPhone SE&rsquo;, despite the widespread belief it would be named&nbsp;iPhone <em>5</em>SE.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a smaller, 4-inch iPhone that packs the same power as the flagship iPhone 6s, supplanting iPhone 5s at the premium, but compact end of Apple&rsquo;s range.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9968" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/iPhone-SE-power.jpg" alt="iPhone SE power" width="600" height="138" /></p>
<p>iPhone SE&nbsp;features an upgraded 12MP camera, along with Live Photos and 4K video. There&rsquo;s a front-facing flash, compatibility for slo-mo video and 63MP panoramas.</p>
<p>Improved battery life over the iPhone 5S will yield longer performance. Faster LTE and WiFi support ensure a more streamlined web experience.</p>
<p>And always-on &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; is super handy for communicating with your personal assistant when you&rsquo;re hands free.</p>
<p>Like iPhone 6s, it also features Apple Pay, so you can make contactless transactions quickly and securely, using your fingerprint as payment confirmation. Yes, that means Touch ID is on board, too.</p>

<p>Design wise, it bears a close resemblance to the popular iPhone 5S, though it will be available in Apple&rsquo;s stunning rose gold hue.</p>
<p>Apple also took the chance to publicly announce&nbsp;iOS 9.3 details, including the highly anticipated <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/night-shift-on-ios-9-3-might-help-you-sleep-at-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Shift</a> mode, a feature that might just help you get more sleep at night. Other headlines included password/fingerprint protection for Notes.</p>
<p>Early impression of iPhone SE are really positive, not just from ourselves, but the tech blogs and news sites from around the world. If I had to summarise this new 4-inch device, I'd say it ties together the raw power and capabilities of iPhone 6s, wrapped up in the compact design of iPhone 5s.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s too early to disclose UK iPhone SE pricing and release dates, but we will bring you more as soon as we know.</strong></p>
