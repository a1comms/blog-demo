<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple might have some serious competition here&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Last week, Samsung announced three brand-new Galaxy S-series models, all of which will be launching in the UK in March. Yes, soon enough, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10e-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S10</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-plus-128gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S10 Plus</a> will be arriving at people&rsquo;s front doors.</p>
<p>Now that we know what each device has to offer, it&rsquo;s only natural that we draw comparisons with other flagship phones.</p>
<p>Put these Android devices next to their iPhone competitors and they have 10 features that could put them at an advantage&hellip;</p>

<h2>1) In-Display Fingerprint Scanners</h2>
<p>Fingerprint scanners have come a long way over the years. The latest Galaxy S10 models sport them in their most futuristic incarnation.</p>
<p>Yes, both the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus have in-display fingerprint sensors, something that Apple hasn&rsquo;t yet introduced. What&rsquo;s more, the latest line of iPhone devices have dropped the fingerprint scanner altogether.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the iPhone X, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xr-64gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XR</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XS</a> and XS Max have migrated the biometric functionality to a snazzy facial recognition scanner, in Face ID.</p>
<h2>2) Reverse Wireless Charging</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the coolest additions to the new Galaxy S-series phones is PowerShare.</p>
<p>The rear of the device acts as an external battery pack, allowing you to power up any Qi compatible devices without any wires or cables.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neat trick and one that&rsquo;s certain to come in handy as we move more toward wireless technology. For instance, you could use your Galaxy S10 device to juice up your brand-new Galaxy Buds (which you can claim for free for a limited time). Simple.</p>
<h2>3) New 5G Capabilities</h2>
<p>While availability isn&rsquo;t yet clear, Samsung did announce a 5G version of the Galaxy S10. Just like it says on the tin, it will boast 5G capabilities, allowing for the next generation of mobile internet.</p>
<p>Of course, 5G isn&rsquo;t yet available in the UK, which means that this feature won&rsquo;t be ready to go right away. However, if you want to be ahead of the game and ready to use it right away, it could be worth keeping an eye out.</p>

<h2>4) Fast Wireless Charging 2.0</h2>
<p>While the latest iPhone devices support wireless charging, Samsung&rsquo;s latest feature really hits it out of the park.</p>
<p>Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 should allow Galaxy S10 users to power up their devices at 12W, which is almost twice as fast as the previous iteration of wireless charging. That&rsquo;s going to blitz the competition for now.</p>
<h2>5) Hole-Punch Cameras</h2>
<p>For those of you who want something even more minimalist than the famous iPhone notch, there&rsquo;s a new trend in town.</p>
<p>Yes, hole-punch cameras mean that the selfie lens floats in a single round shape somewhere on the front of the device.</p>
<p>The S-series models all have this particular design and it&rsquo;s clear to see why people love it. The fashion-forward, more discreet approach is already drawing lots of new fans.</p>
<h2>6) Upgraded Dynamic AMOLED Screens</h2>
<p>Before we go on any further, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Samsung actually supplies Apple with the OLED screens for its iPhone XS and XS Max.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it&rsquo;s hardly a surprise that the company is adorning its own devices with an upgraded display.</p>
<p>The new S-series phones have Dynamic AMOLED screens, which are a massive move forward in terms of quality. You can expect incredible colour variation and picture clarity too.</p>

<h2>7) Triple-Lens Camera Setup</h2>
<p>These days, mobile phones live and die by the quality of their cameras. It&rsquo;s a fact &ndash; people expect epic, professional style setups from their mobile phones.</p>
<p>The Apple dual-lens setup that you can find on the latest iPhone devices is certainly up there with the very best. It&rsquo;s a great offering and most people would be very pleased with it.</p>
<p>However, Samsung Galaxy S10 has a whopping triple-lens setup, sporting two 12-megapixel lenses and a 16-megapixel lens in addition. The latter is also an ultra-wide lens, which can take some astounding panoramic shots. Plus, you can do so without having to move your camera across a line on the screen. That could be a big deal to photography lovers out there.</p>

<h2>8) A Huge Amount of Storage</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to do a whole range of things on your phone &ndash; from listening to music to taking snaps &ndash; storage is kind of a huge deal.</p>
<p>Apple combats this problem by upselling iCloud storage to its customers. Samsung has taken a different approach here. The Galaxy S10 comes in variations, depending on the storage you want. If you have the S10 Plus, the storage options go up to a gigantic 1TB ROM. Wild.</p>
<h2>9) Up to 12GB of RAM</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to talk about RAM. The internal memory is used to power your phone. So, in theory, the more RAM you have, the faster your device will be.</p>
<p>The latest iPhone devices pack 3GB RAM, which Apple fans will know seems to be more than enough to keep the device moving niftily along. However, the largest version of the S10 Plus boasts a huge 12GB of RAM. Let&rsquo;s face it, that&rsquo;s a massive difference.</p>
<h2>10) AI App Prediction</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting things about the new S-series phones is actually something that most users won&rsquo;t recognise. This feature will be working away in the background as you use your phone to make the whole experience smoother and faster.</p>
<p>The AI app prediction learns users&rsquo; habits when they are on their phone. For example, it may learn that a certain user checks Instagram at around 8.30am every single day.</p>
<p>Once that information is stored away, it basically creates a shortcut. So, when the user goes to open Instagram, it will happen faster than ever as it will have pre-loaded the information. When this feature works at its best, you shouldn&rsquo;t notice it at all. That&rsquo;s the beauty of it; it improves your experience quietly without you having to do anything.</p>
