<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple&rsquo;s rumoured pocket-rocket 4-inch iPhone, dubbed iPhone 5SE, is apparently being launched at an Apple event on March 21.</span></p>
<p>According to 9to5Mac<sup>1</sup>, we&rsquo;re less than one month away from seeing Apple announce a scaled-down addition to the iPhone family, in tandem with the unveiling of the iPad Air 3 and a range of new Apple Watch straps.</p>
<p>The elusive 4-inch iPhone 5SE (short for Special Edition &ndash; allegedly) is said to be a metallic device modelled on iPhone 5S, which also sports a 4-inch display. However, iPhone 5SE will apparently share the same curved cover glass as iPhone 6, rather than the sharper lines of iPhone 5S.</p>

<p>Internally, the speculation would have you believe that iPhone 5SE is to house an 8-megapixel iSight camera &ndash; just like iPhone 6 &ndash; as well as Apple Pay and support for Live Photos, though, notably, no 3D Touch (a feature currently exclusive to iPhone 6S&nbsp;and iPhone 6S Plus).</p>
<p>Similar to iPhone 5C, Apple will likely proposition the iPhone 5SE as a more affordable option, though the ostensible use of more premium design materials might open it up to a wider market.</p>
<p>At the very least, it will allow Apple to return to a position of authority in the smaller smartphone category, since refocusing efforts on tackling the growing shift towards larger devices with its 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.</p>
<p>Apple has sent out invites&nbsp;(tagged "Let us loop you in.") for a Keynote event on 21st March, where many expect the iPhone 5SE to be unveiled.</p>
