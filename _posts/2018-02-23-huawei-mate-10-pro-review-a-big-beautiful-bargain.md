<p>Huawei Mate 10 Pro is the latest smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer. And it&rsquo;s a cracking smartphone at that. But let&rsquo;s not get into the hype just yet. The question we&rsquo;re here to answer, is whether you should buy one or not.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that there are loads of premium flagship devices out there on the market. You may well have trouble choosing which one is right for you. To help you along the way, take a look at our Huawei Mate 10 Pro review.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a noticeable design evolution in the Huawei Mate series. The latest incarnation, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, is by far the best-looking phone in the series. Complete with a slightly curved Gorilla Glass back panel and a sturdy metal frame, there&rsquo;s no denying that this device is as sleek as it is slick.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough to get your heart pounding, the front of the Mate 10 Pro is almost all screen, with a near-bezeless design. It&rsquo;s minimal and yet functional; the complete package. All things considered, Huawei clearly wants to move into the mainstream and start battling the likes of iPhone and Samsung.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Huawei certainly hasn&rsquo;t scrimped when it comes to the display. It boasts OLED technology for a clearer, sharper picture. Colours pop and the Full HD quality provides plenty of detail. You&rsquo;re sure to find few faults in this department.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, since the screen in so very big at a whopping six inches, it really stands up against some of the major flagship devices that you can find on the market, like Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8.</p>

<p>The extra size is ideal for users who like watching video content on their smartphone, and are perhaps more likely to be productive, needing more room to view work documents and such.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Of course, any leading smartphone these days requires a killer camera. So, has Huawei Mate 10 Pro stepped up to the mark?</p>
<p>On the rear, we have a dual camera setup &ndash;&nbsp;one boasting a 20MP monochrome lens, and the other a 12MP colour sensor and optical image stabilisation. The purpose of the dual lens setup is to improve the overall quality of your photos, specific to tones and contrast.</p>

<p>Huawei Mate 10 Pro also features AI powered real-time scene and object recognition, which identifies them and automatically adjusts settings like colour, contrast, brightness and more to produce better looking photos.</p>
<p>Plus, the bokeh effect is fun to have a play around with, shifting the focal point of the picture to the subject, blurring out the background in the process.</p>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<p>The battery is seriously impressive on Huawei Mate 10 Pro, able to last an entire day. That includes the times when you&rsquo;re watching videos, playing games, or texting incessantly.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkLTTPh5q6U" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>It comes touting a huge 4,000mAh battery, making it one of the biggest batteries out there right now. That may mean that the phone lasts a little longer than other flagship devices, however the large screen does require plenty of juice, unsurprisingly.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>So, how fast is the device and will it do everything you want it to? Well, the short answer is yes.</p>
<p>Despite Huawei Mate 10 Pro not quite qualifying as a major flagship device, the phone itself has all the power that you could expect from a high-end competitor.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kasios1nyyo" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>You get a super-fast performance from the new Kirin 970 chipset, which has enough power to complete all the typical tasks, like handle games, apps and multitasking. Pair that with the 6GB RAM and you really have got a recipe for success. In short, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>So, what extra Huawei Mate 10 Pro features can you expect?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things you&rsquo;ll notice right away is the custom Huawei interface. Many of the applications here work through Google Play, which means that it&rsquo;s super easy to customise your device from the very moment you get it.</p>
<p>The design of the interface itself is also very user-friendly. Even tech newbies should find it relatively straightforward to use. You can add buttons, hide them, and generally move things around as you please.</p>
<p>Huawei is also challenging the likes of Samsung in a big way. You can hook the phone up to an external screen using a USB-C to HDMI cable and, in theory, use the device as you would a PC.</p>

<p>This particular Huawei May 10 Pro feature is called the EMUI Desktop, and is all set to take on the DeX from its competitor, Samsung. How well this actually works is yet to be seen, but it&rsquo;s a pretty neat idea.</p>
<h2>Price and Release Date</h2>
<p>The good news is that Huawei Mate 10 Pro is out right now. That means that you can go ahead and order it online and have it in your hands sooner than you think.</p>
<p>SIM free, you can pick up Huawei Mate 10 Pro for just &pound;529. Alternatively, you get it on contract, &pound;0 upfront from just &pound;36 a month. Or you can finance the cost, at just &pound;23.25 a month.</p>
