<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">PlayStation gamers, you do not want to miss this offer.</span></p>
<p>Calling all gamers! If you&rsquo;re part of the PlayStation tribe, you might want to listen up. We&rsquo;ve got some seriously exciting news for you&hellip;</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready to take your gaming hobby to a whole new level, we&rsquo;ve got just the thing...</p>
<p>Oh yes, here&rsquo;s the down-low on a great new deal that means you can get the ultimate gaming experience for free.</p>
<h2>The Ultimate Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve long moved past the idea that gaming is a solitary activity. These days, the latest games (I&rsquo;m looking at you, FIFA 18 and Call of Duty!) are played against other players, around the world, in real-time. All from your own living room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where PlayStation Plus comes into the picture. The subscription means that you can challenge other gamers to battle it out online. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;world&rsquo;s largest community of new-gen players,&rsquo; according to Sony PlayStation itself.</p>

<p>As though playing people all over the world wasn&rsquo;t enough to get your gaming thumbs twitching, there&rsquo;s more to the PlayStation Plus subscription...</p>
<p>Each month, the service includes a couple of free games that you can download and play. These could include classic PS games, add-ons, and exclusive releases.</p>
<p>You also get access to brand-new games while they&rsquo;re in the Beta stage, discounts and offers, and 10GB of cloud storage. Needless to say, PlayStation Plus is quite the package.</p>

<p>Usually, this boat-load of gaming fun would set you back &pound;6.99 a month (that&rsquo;s &pound;83.88 over a year). However, there&rsquo;s an easy way that you can bag yourself a 12-month free subscription to PlayStation Plus.</p>
<h2>Get a Free 12-Month PlayStation Plus Membership</h2>
<p>So, how does it work? Well, it&rsquo;s quite simple. If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade your phone, you may want to choose to get the Sony Xperia XZ2, XZ2 Compact or XZ Premium. Should you get one of these devices with Buy Mobiles up until 30th June, you&rsquo;re in for a treat.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your new Sony device, you can open the Xperia Lounge app and claim your 12-month free membership as part of the deal. Inside the app, you will see a PlayStation Plus tile, which you can click to redeem the offer. Nothing could be easier! Let the gaming commence.</p>
