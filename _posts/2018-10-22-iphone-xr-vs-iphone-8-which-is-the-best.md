<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Three&hellip; Two&hellip; One&hellip; Fight!</span></p>
<p>Are you thinking about upgrading your smartphone? If you&rsquo;ve got your eye placed firmly on a brand new iPhone, there are loads of options out there right now. Two of the more affordable happen to be iPhone 8 and the new iPhone XR. But wait a moment, which is right for you? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Design</h2>
<p>iPhone 8 was the last in line sporting Apple&rsquo;s classic design. The look that had been unleashed with iPhone 6 model followed right through to the 7 and then the 8 as well.</p>
<p>So, when you look at iPhone 8, it doesn&rsquo;t quite look as high tech or futuristic as other phones might. The phone has bezels both above and below the screen and a pretty sizeable home button. However, don&rsquo;t let that fool you &ndash; it&rsquo;s still an awesome device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, iPhone XR boasts the most modern Apple look. It has an almost bezeless display, no home button, and a super minimal look. It comes in a broad range of colours too, including white, black, blue, yellow, coral and red. In contrast, iPhone 8 only comes in space grey, silver and gold.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Display</h2>
<p>In terms of the screen, you will notice a major difference. The iPhone 8 has a simple LCD screen offering coming in at just 4.7 inches. There&rsquo;s a 750 x 1334 resolution which, given the screen size, actually comes out at the same pixel density as iPhone XR. There&rsquo;s also a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>The iPhone XR takes things up a notch, in both size and performance. The LCD screen comes in at a massive 6.1 inches. There&rsquo;s an 828 x 1792 resolution as well as a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The takeaway is that neither has the same impressive OLED screens we&rsquo;ve seen on iPhone X models, but they will both perform well.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Camera</h2>
<p>When it comes to the rear camera, both iPhone XR and iPhone 8 have the same setup. You&rsquo;re looking at a 12-megapixel f/1.8 single lens camera, which should serve you well. However, the XR has a couple of advantages over the 8. For one thing, it has Smart HDR, which should improve the photos you take along with extra features like a better True Tone flash than former models.</p>
<p>On the front, both devices offer the 7-megapixel f/2.2 camera. However, iPhone XR&rsquo;s version is a True Depth one, the likes of which makes facial recognition and other neat tricks available. It also means that you can use Animoji and Memoji when you get this phone.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Extras</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already covered, iPhone XR has a few tricks up its sleeve. You get Face ID, Animoji, Memoji, and some cool AR features in with the package. However, that&rsquo;s quite possibly where the differences start and end.</p>
<p>Neither iPhone features a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, but instead enables headphone use via the Lightning jack (to save space). Both are water resistant too and offer a range of high-end Apple features, such as a new and improved FaceTime setup. The differences are minor, but you will notice them.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Power</h2>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s talk about power. The iPhone 8 has the older version of the Apple chipset &ndash; the A11 Bionic. It should come as no surprise that iPhone XR takes things up a level with the A12 Bionic chip.</p>
<p>That means that there will be a noticeable difference when it comes to the two devices and, of course, how they ultimately perform. The new chip is said to be 15% faster than its predecessor and 50% more energy efficient.</p>
<p>When it comes to the operating system, though, both phones have the same deal. The latest iOS 12 update is available to download on iPhone 8, and already features on iPhone XR straight out the box. There aren&rsquo;t too many major differences between the interface, apart from how you navigate between apps and the homescreen due to the inclusion or exclusion of the home button.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Battery</h2>
<p>Of course, we all want our smartphones to stay juiced up all day long&hellip; but which phone has the most umph? The short answer is iPhone XR.</p>
<p>Yes, Apple has seriously upped the game when it comes to this one. They claim that the phone can use 15 hours online or 16 hours of video before it runs out. That&rsquo;s a huge improvement on iPhone 8, which only has 12 hours online and 13 hours of video time before it hits zero.</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Price</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the deets on each phone, let&rsquo;s talk cold, hard cash. How much do you want to invest in your next iPhone?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been quite some time since iPhone 8 was released, which is good news for your pocket. The standard version of the phone starts at &pound;599 and there&rsquo;s a whole range of deals online for it.</p>
<p>Of course, with iPhone XR being a newer model, you can expect to pay a little more for it. It&rsquo;s now available for pre-order starting at &pound;749. It will be in available to buy from 26th October. When the device comes out, though, it will be well worth looking at what&rsquo;s out there!</p>

<h2>iPhone XR vs. iPhone 8: Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which phone is right for you? Well, that depends on your budget and what you&rsquo;re looking for. There&rsquo;s no doubt that iPhone 8 is a decent device, offering a wide range of features. However, when it comes to the design, latest security features, speed and battery power, it lacks. If you&rsquo;re looking for a decent smartphone, though, it fits the bill.</p>
<p>The iPhone XR is a little snazzier, with a speedy chipset, ultra-cool design, and a few extra features. The biggest bonus with this phone is the fact that you get all of the beauty of iPhone X without the large price tag. Coming in at a much lower cost means that it&rsquo;s truly the budget edition of the latest Apple range. Nice.</p>
