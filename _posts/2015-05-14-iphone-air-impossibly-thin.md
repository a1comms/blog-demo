<p><span class="postStandFirst">A team of visionary designers has produced a conceptualised video of what is being dubbed &lsquo;iPhone Air&rsquo;, thus fuelling the rumours that allege Apple will launch a trinity of iPhones this year.</span></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6754" align="aligncenter" width="850"]<img class="wp-image-6754" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/display_color_xlarge-1024x635.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/display_color_xlarge.jpg alt="iPhone Air said to be over 2mm thinner than iPhone 6" />" width="850" height="528" /> iPhone Air said to be over 2mm thinner than iPhone 6[/caption]</p>
<p>iPhone Air, if it is anything more than a hopeful whisper, will likely be accompanied by what we assume will be called iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.</p>
<p>If the concept video (posted below) is anything to go by, iPhone Air&rsquo;s design looks fairly similar to iPhone 6, if a little squarer and more abrupt around the edges.</p>
<p>Its depth, however, is reported to amount to an almost indiscernible 4.3mm, making it the UK&rsquo;s thinnest mobile phone, by some measure.</p>
<p>By the same token, screen size looks to have been scaled down, in order to attract the market demographic that prefers a smaller handset. Like iPhone 5s, iPhone Air is claimed to sport a 4-inch display, though much more advanced with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, making it Full HD.</p>
<p>Additionally, the camera unit is told to be enhanced over previous generations of iPhone, at 13-megapixels. It&rsquo;ll reportedly be capable of shooting 4K video, too.</p>
<p>Regards to storage space, there could be two size variants: 32GB and 64GB. And looking at battery power, iPhone Air is said to feature something around the 3200mAh mark.</p>
<p>Some experts are questioning whether the technology to build a handset so accomplished, yet so slim, is even available&nbsp;yet. This point has, in turn, prompted a response that asserts iPhone Air isn&rsquo;t scheduled for launch until next year.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s only a handful of people in the world that&rsquo;re a) important enough, and b) lucky enough, to know precisely what Apple has up its sleeve. So for now, we can only speculate.</p>
<h2>iPhone Air &ndash; the concept</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zH40-6N5CC4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Created by SET Solutions, a 3D graphic and animations company from Italy, the concept TV ad mimics Apple&rsquo;s own iPad Air 2 commercial, complete with a blanched backdrop and horizontally placed yellow pencil.</p>
<p>In a rather dramatic fashion, lasers, invisible to the naked eye, begin ruthlessly shaving off the top portion of the pencil with unwavering precision, leaving just 6.1mm of it remaining. Script reading &lsquo;iPad Air 6.1mm thin&rsquo; suddenly pops up above the trimmed pencil, to illustrate the impressive leanness of Apple&rsquo;s new iPad.</p>
<p>Then, extraordinarily, the laser beams return for a second, graphite-lusting attack on the increasingly emaciated pencil, finally sparing what looks to be just half of its natural form. The plot twist being, of course, that the fabled iPhone Air has been concealed behind it the entire time. Yet, it&rsquo;s so impossibly thin, we were never to know.</p>
<p>Characteristic of Apple&rsquo;s ads, we&rsquo;re then faced with a 3D presentation of iPhone Air, as the resplendent device rotates in each and every direction, showing off its alluring design at various angles. All the while, the orchestra performing in the background is reaching a frightful crescendo.</p>
<p><strong>Flashes of headline specs, over a silhouette of iPhone Air, tantalise our techy taste buds. And finally, we&rsquo;re met with the words &lsquo;iPhone Air&rsquo;, penned in a familiar looking typeface, left to linger for just a few seconds on screen, and few more in our minds...</strong></p>
