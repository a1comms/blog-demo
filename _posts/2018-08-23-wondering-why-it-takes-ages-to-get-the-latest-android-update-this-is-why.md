<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Some things are worth the wait, though.</span></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, we humans aren&rsquo;t the most patient of creatures. When a new thing comes out, we want it... and we want it now! Waiting even a day seems too much, let alone months on end. That leads us to the obvious question: What&rsquo;s the hold up here, eh?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s likely the mind-boggling thought going through your brain if you happen to have one of the many Sony devices. Android Pie, the latest operating system, was announced by Google back in March. Since then, it&rsquo;s been rolled out for a whole range of phones with many Sony users wondering when it will be their turn.</p>
<p>The answer depends entirely on which device you happen to have. Some updates are on their way sooner than others. Let&rsquo;s break it down. If you have an Xperia XZ2, XZ2 Premium, XZ2 Compact, Xperia XZ Premium, XZ1, or XZ1 Compact, you should be getting the latest update by November this year. However, Sony Xperia XA2, and&nbsp;XA2 Ultra&nbsp;models won&rsquo;t get the update until 2019. Yikes.</p>

<p>Now, before you go getting all upset about the long wait coming your way, there&rsquo;s something you really should know. While a matter of months might sound like a seriously long time, there&rsquo;s a good reason that you have to wait. What&rsquo;s more, the people at Sony want to explain exactly what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>To help users understand what&rsquo;s taking so long, <a href="https://blogs.sonymobile.com/2018/08/16/can-update-xperia-android-pie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony has released a helpful little infographic</a>&nbsp;(below). It quickly and simply explains why the Android OS rollout take a little longer for some devices than others. From optimising the OS to testing it (both internally and externally), there are a whole load of hoops manufacturers have to jump through before the final release. It&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>Check out the infographic for yourself:</p>

<p>Of course, understanding just why things are taking so long might not sweeten the deal too much. Still, there has to be some solace in knowing that the folk over at Sony are working hard to give you the latest operating system as soon as they can.</p>
