<p><span class="postStandFirst">After Motorola was bought from Google, by Lenovo, many people assumed that Lenovo/Motorola would be making the next Nexus phone, but it seems like that might not be the case after all. If the latest rumour is true, the Nexus 6 will actually be made by someone else entirely...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7449/11948876543_132fde1238.jpg" width="500" height="347" /></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Phone Arena, that someone is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/lg">LG</a>.</p>
<p>If this rumour is indeed true, it&rsquo;s perhaps one of the most uncontroversial rumours we&rsquo;ve ever seen, considering that both the Nexus 4 and the&nbsp;Nexus 5&nbsp;were also made by LG. Thus, the idea that LG might be making the next Nexus phone as well was a no-brainer for many, in spite of Lenovo&rsquo;s purchase of Motorola.</p>
<p>After all, LG has proven they can deliver the goods, by building a phone (in the shape of the Nexus 5) that can&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;compete with this year&rsquo;s flagship phones like the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5.</p>
<p>As for what the LG Nexus 6 might be like, this new rumour suggests that it will be based on the currently unannounced LG G3, in much the same way that the Nexus 5 was based on the LG G2. If that really is the case (and if the rumours about the LG G3 are&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;true), then the Nexus 6 will purportedly have a 16MP camera, a new 64-bit processor, and a&nbsp;<em>ridiculously</em>&nbsp;sharp &ldquo;Quad HD&rdquo; screen measuring 1440 x 2560 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>In short, if this rumour is indeed true, the Nexus 6 may well be one of the most amazing phones the world has ever seen!</strong></p>
