<p><span class="postStandFirst">After being unveiled a couple of months ago, the BlackBerry Passport will finally be available to buy soon. With a pin-sharp square screen optimised for reading text, a super-fast quad-core processor and a suite of tools (and a touch-enabled keyboard) designed to increase productivity; the BlackBerry Passport could prove to be the start of the Canadian manufacturer&rsquo;s big comeback.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The BlackBerry Passport caused a stir when it was first unveiled, largely due to the fact that it looks so unconventional. Nonetheless, a fair number of people have shown a lot of interest in buying the phone, with some saying that this could be the beginning of BlackBerry&rsquo;s big comeback.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been looking forward to getting hold of one, then we have good news: the BlackBerry Passport is going to be available to buy from us, very soon!</p>
<p>That square screen, the bit that&rsquo;s captured the most headlines, is the most intriguing part of the whole thing; there&rsquo;s a very good reason for the screen to be like that as it&rsquo;s optimised for reading text (such as emails, or ebooks). The 4.5-inch screen also has a resolution of 1440x1440 pixels, so it can easily compete alongside superphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the HTC One M8.</p>
<p>Of course, the wide, touch-enabled keyboard means that it&rsquo;s as easy to enter text as it is to read it!</p>
<p>The BlackBerry Passport is also vastly more powerful than its predecessors, with a quad-core processor clocked to 2.26GHz. The battery has also been improved, with BlackBerry saying that the talk time clocks in at 30 hours!</p>
<p>Almost as intriguing as the screen is the inclusion of BlackBerry Assistant, a virtual assistant that looks like it&rsquo;s aiming to take on Siri and Cortana at their own game (and we <i>really</i> want to try this bit out, to see how it compares to its rivals).</p>
<p>In addition to the core software features, productivity apps will be available from BlackBerry World, while Android apps and games are usable on the phone, and can be downloaded from the Amazon Appstore.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more news, because the BlackBerry Passport is coming soon, and you do not want to miss out!</p>
