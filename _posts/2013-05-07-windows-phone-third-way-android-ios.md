<p><span class="postStandFirst">It may not be a popular as Android or iOS, but Windows Phone is an incredible operating system with some cool features that are often overlooked. Here, we highlight what makes it brilliant and well worth the switch!</span></p>
<p>If you look at the smartphone marketplace, you&rsquo;ll see that the phones which grab the most headlines are pretty much always smartphones that run on either Android or iOS. Phones like the iPhone 5, or the wildly popular Samsung Galaxy S4 seem to be the ones that everyone wants to talk about the most.</p>
<p>However, there is of course another operating system out there, and although it&rsquo;s not yet seen the huge sales of its two big rivals, it&rsquo;s starting to make quite a name for itself, as a brilliant, intuitive smartphone platform.</p>
<p>That platform is, of course,&nbsp;Windows Phone, and there are some rather cool phones using it.</p>
<h2><strong>HTC 8X</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/htc_8x_tmb.jpg" width="66" height="132" /></span></strong></p>
<p>HTC was one of the first manufacturers to release Windows phones, although that&rsquo;s perhaps not surprising, considering that the company first made a name for itself by producing smartphones running on the&nbsp;<em>previous</em>&nbsp;smartphone platform that Microsoft produced, Windows Mobile. Although HTC is now known more for making Android phones like the HTC One, the range of Windows phones produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer is also rather nice, and the best of the bunch is the brilliant HTC 8X.</p>
<p>The HTC 8X serves as the&nbsp;<em>perfect</em>&nbsp;mid-range Windows Phone experience, with a decent processor and a gorgeous screen; HTC have even managed to make their phone stand out in terms of software, too, by adding a new Live Tile of their famous clock!</p>
<h2>Nokia Lumia 520</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/windows/nokia-lumia-520"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/nokia_lumia_520_tmb.jpg" width="63" height="123" /></span></strong></a></p>
<p>If the HTC 8X is the perfect mid-range Windows Phone device, then the Nokia Lumia 520 is the perfect&nbsp;<em>entry-level</em>&nbsp;Windows Phone device.</p>
<p>The Nokia Lumia 520 offers the same user experience as higher spec phones, but at a fraction of the price. It&rsquo;s not short on power, either, because it uses a 1GHz dual-core processor, and combined with the inherently fast, fluid nature of Windows Phone, it makes the Nokia Lumia 520, as with every Windows phone, an absolute joy to use.</p>
<h2>Nokia Lumia 920</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/nokia_lumia_920_black_tmb.jpg" width="71" height="135" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Nokia has the entry-level Windows Phone arena pretty much sewn up with the Lumia 520, but it&rsquo;s safe to say that the Finnish manufacturer also dominates the&nbsp;<em>top-end</em>&nbsp;Windows Phone arena, thanks to the slab of polycarbonate loveliness that is the Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p>The Lumia 920 really is a gorgeous phone, with an industrial design that looks truly mouth-watering. Those gorgeous looks are aided by the beautiful screen, although the screen also brings another benefit; its touch sensor is so sensitive that the Nokia Lumia 920 can even be comfortably used with gloves on! Combine that with a superb camera, and it makes for a truly alluring phone, in the Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p><strong>Although Windows Phone doesn&rsquo;t grab as many headlines as Android or iOS, it&rsquo;s very clear that smartphones running on this platform are most definitely not slouches; in fact, if one takes &lsquo;platform preference&rsquo; (i.e. whether you&nbsp;<em>prefer</em>&nbsp;the feel of Android, for example), then Windows phones are some of the most powerful and amazing smartphones on the market!</strong></p>
