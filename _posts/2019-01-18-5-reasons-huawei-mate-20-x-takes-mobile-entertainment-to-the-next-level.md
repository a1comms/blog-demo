<p>Are you something of an entertainment junkie? Do you love nothing more than gaming the hours away or binge-watching TV like it&rsquo;s going out of fashion?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re screaming yes, yes, and yes, we&rsquo;ve got some good news coming your way. Here are five reasons that the Huawei Mate 20 X is the right phone for you.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exEGEhjAh1g" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>1) It Has A Massive 7.2-inch Display</h2>
<p>One of the most attractive things about the Huawei Mate 20 X is the screen. Get ready for a smartphone screen that&rsquo;s bigger and better than any Huawei to date.</p>
<p>The huge 7.2-inch OLED display means that using the device is a real experience like no other. With a crisp display and flawless colour, there&rsquo;s so much to love here.</p>
<p>No longer will you have to squint to see what&rsquo;s on the device. Instead, you can sit back, relax, and relish in that big screen feel from a smartphone. What more could you want?</p>
<h2>2) It's Even Really Comfortable to Hold</h2>
<p>We know what you&rsquo;re thinking: That astronomical screen-size is going to present a rather annoying issue &ndash;&nbsp;you won&rsquo;t be able to hold the device in one hand. Wrong!</p>
<p>The designers over at Huawei have gone to great lengths to make sure that this is not the case. The precision-crafted design of the device means that it actually fits comfortably in one hand. You should have no problem using the device.</p>
<p>That leaves your other hand free to tap away when you&rsquo;re playing a game or stop and start your video streaming session.</p>
<h2>3) It Has All the Speed and Reliability!</h2>
<p>The last thing you want when you&rsquo;re playing the latest hit on your smartphone is any interruptions.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the Huawei Mate 20 X is powered by GPU Turbo 2.0 technology, making it the ideal choice for gamers.</p>
<p>Regardless of how graphic-heavy games are, this tech should mean that you get a speedy and reliable experience every single time that you play. You never have to worry.</p>

<h2>4) Its Super Long-lasting Battery Life</h2>
<p>When it comes to power, the Huawei Mate 20 X has more than you might imagine.</p>
<p>Packing a huge 5000 mAh battery, the device will keep going for hours on end no matter what you happen to be doing.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re binge-watching the series everyone's talking about or playing a completely addictive game on your phone, you can be sure that the battery will keep going and won&rsquo;t let you down.</p>
<p>Add that to the AI-driven aspect of the phone and you can be sure that you will get all the power you could possibly need.</p>

<h2>5) Stereophonic Sound System</h2>
<p>But wait, what about the sound system? We hear you. (Pun intended!)</p>
<p>The Huawei Mate 20 X is fitted with an awesome stereophonic sound system that gives you a professional level sound quality. It offers a &lsquo;fully immersive audio experience&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Boasting dual symmetrical speakers at both ends of the device and a super high dynamic range up to 40 dB, there&rsquo;s no way that you will be disappointed with this one. Nice.</p>
