<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Let the battle commence!</span></p>
<p>Looking for a new flagship phone? If you like a little extra size, you can&rsquo;t go far wrong with Plus models. They&rsquo;re bigger, often better, and look more impressive than the standard models.</p>
<p>Right now, there are two wildly futuristic devices on the market. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably had a chance to check both these phones out before now, but can you decide which one&rsquo;s worth your cash? You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what each device has to offer, as line up <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a> vs. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at all familiar with the look of Apple&rsquo;s recent iPhone Plus models, you won&rsquo;t be surprised by this latest model.</p>
<p>iPhone 8 Plus looks pretty similar to the last few generations, flaunting a simple and spacious looking front, with smooth, curved edges that flow from one side of the device to the other.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0DN-BZrM4o" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a winning formula that Apple has been tweaking over the last few years, rather than radically changing things. However, the latest iPhone 8 Plus does boast a new glass panel on the front and back.</p>
<p>Of course, like previous generations, iPhone 8 Plus is precision-engineered to resist water and dust. And colour wise, it comes in three options: Gold, Silver, or Space Grey.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15242" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ph3gjliLB7QEH6mY2eIb8pfit-z1TrlGYWjzzcggOBfmIfk4LqQ5bEh4QS0COpMABuBL81QW6m1U_W7mLEidWeAE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When pitted against Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, Apple&rsquo;s latest Plus model looks a little dated. The Galaxy S8 Plus is a completely new take for Samsung, complete with a futuristic style we&rsquo;ve been waiting to see for years.</p>
<p>The bezeless design, along with the fact that the fingerprint is now on the back of the phone, gives Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus a truly minimalist design. With only a small amount of space occupied at the top and bottom, this smartphone is pretty much all screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13617" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G-U2gTZRgscOsoPAUx-IpPk6kP4vlYia52HHdFSw9TEd5mwIYspI-6tZz0q8sZOXgjBI4hfyvyZwEARamYaN7qM=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, just like iPhone 8 Plus, Samsung&rsquo;s latest flagship is also dust and water-resistant. What&rsquo;s more, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has an extra colour option. You can get it in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Rose Pink or Arctic Silver.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>iPhone 8 Plus comes sporting a neat 5.5-inch, Full HD screen (1080 x 1920 pixels). It&rsquo;s nothing to be sniffed at, but these days, people seem to want bigger, better, brighter screens than that. Still, it&rsquo;s a decent enough screen with a top-end feel.</p>
<p>Where Apple really shines (or, in fact, reduces shine) is with its True Tone technology, which ensures that the display colour adapts to the phone&rsquo;s surroundings. That means that the brightness and saturation automatically shift depending on where you&rsquo;re using your device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14946" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1jz1SOKYyM3PYyrmGv1sLmFTEz4GaOm9pLD-BBd0dWIe6PyefSk92fv0lqOzBX4jQX0o4fujZAaEGlYKCgrwcvZf=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, though, the Galaxy S8 Plus is all about the display. So, it should come as no real surprise when we tell you that it&rsquo;s top of the line.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus boasts a whopping 6.2-inch screen, with a hefty 1440 x 2960 pixels. That gives it an 83.7% screen to body ratio, making for a seriously impressive viewing experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13608" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6aI5IfsSXZZ7RfQEc_4cbmXQYeBbnu4U-QHmA6-nUq9rLx1hs0llQWDlGHZngBCs-R4uko9pkAFf4eFNnPBF_eLp0Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The result is clean and crisp imaging, from a Quad HD resolution. For sheer size and quality of display, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is possibly the best smartphone out there. Rivalled only, perhaps, by its bigger brother: Samsung Galaxy Note 8.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Sadly, Face ID doesn&rsquo;t feature on iPhone 8 Plus (you&rsquo;ll need an iPhone X to nab that nifty feature!). Instead, customers are treated to the old fail-safe: the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It&rsquo;s nothing new, but works like a dream and is as responsive as ever.</p>
<p>For the first time on an iPhone, the 8 Plus features wireless charging. Using a compatible charging pad, all you do is place the device on it to refuel. While it&rsquo;s nothing new for the industry, it&rsquo;s great to see Apple finally embrace it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14949" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kSY9Rfs9lob1Mm7zkN2xIS6-CntEKoYLElz5zF5vd9GTBJTnzJ7XV6adASnME_TLqQb9hacA1NFxVyiTCkOUwxUQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus also boasts a fingerprint sensor. The only noticeable difference being that it&rsquo;s located on the back, rather than the front of the phone.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Galaxy S8 Plus features wireless charging for added convenience. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that it now also features Bixby, which is essentially Samsung&rsquo;s version of Siri, capable of actioning commands, searching for items online from your camera view and providing all sorts of reminders.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>So far, it appears Samsung is running away with the title of &lsquo;best flagship phone,&rsquo; but hold on just a minute. The camera is where Apple consistently shines.</p>
<p>iPhone 8 Plus offers a ten-fold Digital Zoom, double Optical Zoom, Auto Flash, Face Detection, and Touch to Focus. All that, plus 4608 x 2592-pixel image resolution and a 7MP selfie lens makes this a pretty awesome camera phone.</p>
<p>Plus, the new Portrait Lighting mode on iPhone 8 Plus&rsquo; selfie camera is a showstopper. Take a look at what we mean in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REZl-ANYKKY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s front camera offers a slightly higher resolution at 8MP, with a wide aperture for plenty of light, and Smart Auto Focus for ensuring your selfies aren&rsquo;t blurred. No jazzy Portrait Lighting, though.</p>
<p>The main 12-megapixel camera is built to take bright and clear photos whatever the lighting situation, thanks to a large f/1.7 aperture lens. And the fast focus means you can take photos of things in motion, without the subject being blurred.</p>
<p>Then, if you&rsquo;re confident using a camera, you can try out Pro Mode, mastering settings like your shutter speed, exposure and white balance, for more professional looking shots.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Built with Apple&rsquo;s A11 Bionic chip and 3GB of RAM, iPhone 8 Plus offers a more than impressive performance package. There have been reports to suggest that the chipset multi-core performance scores at around 50% higher than most Android chips.</p>
<p>The battery comes in at 2,675mAh, offering up to 21 hours of charge at 100%. Needless to say, that time will vary depending on how much you use your device on a day-to-day basis. But it should be plenty to see you through from leaving the house to tucking up in bed.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a little more RAM, at 4GB. It features the Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 8895, which has proved to be pretty beastly. Where Samsung really excels, though, is the battery. With a 3500mAh capacity, the S8 Plus is said to yield up to 24 hours user time.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Now that you know what each smartphone offers, let&rsquo;s talk about which is better for your budget. iPhone 8 Plus comes in at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-gold?simfree=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;799 SIM free</a>, or from <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;48 a month with 8GB of data</a>. Alternatively, you can finance it from just <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-gold?simfree=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&pound;35.11 a month</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much in it, with Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus coming in at &pound;779 SIM free. On contract, you&rsquo;re looking at &pound;42 a month with a whopping 30GB data. Of course, there&rsquo;s a finance option, too, available on a 0% APR agreement at just &pound;29.21 a month.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In some ways, Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is perhaps the better of the two smartphones &ndash; it has more RAM, a bigger screen, a fresher design, and even extra gadgets to boot. With that in mind, many will tout it as the best on the market&hellip; and maybe it is.</p>
<p>But, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should overlook the iPhone 8 Plus. With a classic design, an upgraded camera, and an ultra-fast chipset, it still has a lot to offer. So, try both for yourself and see which fits your needs!</p>
