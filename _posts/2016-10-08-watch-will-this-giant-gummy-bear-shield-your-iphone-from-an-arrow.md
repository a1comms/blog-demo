<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Warning: The following video contains content that gummy bear- and iPhone-lovers may find disturbing!</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a story that brings together two things all of us love dearly; the latest technology and delicious sweeties. I don&rsquo;t know about you but there&rsquo;s nothing in the world I&rsquo;d like more than a giant helping of my favourite snack. If you&rsquo;re a fan of the humble gummy bear, how does a massive 2.3kg version of the sweet sound to you? Pretty scrumptious, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Sadly, in this particular case, no one actually got to eat the bear in question. It might sound like nothing short of a travesty but this large sugary treat was meant for greater things in this world.</p>
<p>Rather than guzzling down the gummy delight right away, which is, frankly, what most of us would do, the good people at PhoneBuff had other plans. They posed a simple yet deep and meaningful question: Can a giant gummy bear protect an iPhone 6 from the wrath of an oncoming arrow?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11784" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Will-this-giant-gummy-bear-shield-your-iPhone-from-an-arrow-bear-vs-arrow-gif.gif" alt="will-this-giant-gummy-bear-shield-your-iphone-from-an-arrow-bear-vs-arrow-gif" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve all asked ourselves at some point, and now we might finally have our answer. So, to find out the truth, the guys propped up an iPhone and strategically placed the oversized gummy bear in front of it. The theory was that the chewy sweet was so dense and gooey, not even an arrow could pass through it.</p>
<p>Then, things got a little brutal. The team enlisted the help of Vannak Voutha, a skilled archer from the All West Regional Bowhunter Team. His sole mission in this experiment was to do the unthinkable; to fire an arrow directly at the gummy bear and iPhone.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re feeling a little anxious about the fate of both the phone and bear, you&rsquo;re not alone. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the PhoneBuff team had their fair share of doubts too. &ldquo;This thing smells great, it tastes great, but will it be strong enough to protect the iPhone? I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; admitted one presenter right before Vannak drew back his arrow. So, did the precious Apple gadget survive? Well, you&rsquo;ll have to watch the video to find out!</p>
