<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">From 1973, all the way up to today.</span></p>
<p>In the 40+ years since the dawn of the 1970s, the technology industry has evolved from a relatively misunderstood and geeky crowd, to what is perhaps one of today&rsquo;s most dynamic and exciting fields.</p>
<p>And such is the nature of technology, that it&rsquo;s becoming more and more advanced at an exponential rate. So much so, that if you dragged your typical man in the street all the way from the 70s to today, complete with flares and rose-tinted glasses, the sight of GPS, 3D printing and mobile phones like iPhone 6s might just send him on a trip <em>even he</em> couldn&rsquo;t handle&hellip; and he&rsquo;s from the 70s. Tripping was their thing.</p>
<p>I digress. The focus here is the history of mobile phones: where the journey began, where it is today and what's happened in between. As you&rsquo;ll soon see in the infographic below, it all started with a smug phone call from a bright engineer back in 1973, and has reached a point where future possibilities do seem boundless.</p>
<p>Enjoy and try not to feel too old if you can remember the earlier mobile phones on this timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Just imagine what this timeline might look like in just five years&rsquo; time&hellip;</strong></p>
