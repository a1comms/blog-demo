<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-4672 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/HTC-One-Review-1024x520.jpg" alt="HTC One Review" width="960" height="487" /></p>
<p>HTC has always been a company of innovation, with beautifully designed products that have each brought something new to the smartphone world.</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;HTC One, the Taiwanese giant has combined an entire army of great new features in just one handset.</p>
<p>The HTC One is an exquisite device, crafted from a single block of aluminium and housing a truly stunning 4.7 inch Full 1080p display, with an eye-bursting 469ppi.The uni body of the HTC One houses the BoomSound stereo speakers at the front of the device, designed to kick out an audio output of 93DB, and basically turning the handset into your own personal stereo. The back of the phone houses the amazing UltraPixel camera (another of HTC's latest innovations). An LED flash is also included and, asides from the HTC logo and Beats branding, the back cover is elegantly simple, showcasing the phenomenal build of the phone.</p>
<p>However with the HTC One beauty is more than just skin deep. The device packs a Snapdragon 600 quad&ndash;core&nbsp;chipset clocked at 1.7ghz, which is supported by 2GB of Ram and the Adreno 320 GPU. All that power allows the HTC One to fly through tasks, apps and 3D games.</p>
<p>The camera in the HTC One is something called an UltraPixel camera. This is a new type of camera that offers amazing low light capture, this coupled with HTC's Zoe feature offers one of the most unique imaging experiences of recent times.</p>
<p>Zoe is one of several new features brought to the table in HTC's version of Android called Sense 5. With this, HTC has completely changed the overlook of the platform bringing many exclusives to Android, such as BlinkFeed, Sense TV and the aforementioned Zoe.</p>
<p>On the media side of things, HTC has included a new version of the popular Watch app which allows the user to download or stream the latest movies and tv programmes in stunning 1080p on the One or sharing them wirelessly to the big screen. Beats Audio is included on the device, allowing for a rich and full audio experience, either through headphones or via the amazing BoomSound speakers located on the front of the handset.</p>
<p><strong>The HTC One is a smartphone that rarely comes around, but when it does it simply blows your mind. In a nutshell, this is an amazing, diverse and breath-taking device, boasting cutting-edge technology and innovative features. &nbsp;</strong></p>
