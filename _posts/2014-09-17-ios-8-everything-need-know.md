<p><span class="postStandFirst">As of today, the new and improved iOS 8 is free to download for compatible Apple devices. Dubbed as &lsquo;huge for developers&rsquo;, this is perhaps the most progressive iOS update yet. We take a look at its most distinguishing features.</span></p>

<p>Every day since 8<sup>th</sup> September, one of the following Apple related names or products has been trending on Twitter: Apple, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, Apple Watch and Tim Cook.</p>
<p>Ironically, Apple hasn&rsquo;t yet plugged itself into the Twittersphere many of us are so fond of; neither has it created a Facebook account. Nevertheless, you simply can&rsquo;t log on without an immediate barrage of Apple related reports.</p>
<p>A case in point is today&rsquo;s number one Twitter trend &ndash; iOS 8. No points for guessing that one.</p>
<p>So of course, today is <em>the</em> day that users with compatible devices can download the latest version of Apple&rsquo;s operating system.</p>
<p>Some of you may recall iOS 8&rsquo;s introduction earlier this summer, where we were treated to an overview of its upcoming features.</p>
<p>However, for those who were unfortunate enough to miss the initial hype, you&rsquo;ve come to right place. Here, you will learn everything you need to know about iOS 8.</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>iOS 7 was all about delivering a pretty dramatic design overhaul, whereas iOS 8 focuses much more on functionality improvements.</p>
<p>A search bar that allows you to locate specific pictures by their date, the location they were taken at and by the name of the album they&rsquo;re stored in, has been implemented into the Photos app. Smart Albums will also organise those pictures for you, so you don&rsquo;t have to. It&rsquo;s the little things.</p>
<p>There are new editing tools that require no experience or skill (thank the Lord), but allow users to produce professional-looking results.</p>
<p>You can fine-tune everything from light, colour, contrast, shadows and much more. You can crop photos even after you take them, and block out the less desirable aspects of the shot.</p>
<p>And you can also relive your pictures like never before, in the new Time-lapse mode, which showcases your photos in a mesmerising, accelerated sequence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5281 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-17-at-13.06.45.png" alt="iOS 8 - improved photo editing tools" width="976" height="480" /><span class="caption">Image: crop your photos to cut out the unnecessary bits.

<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>Looking at the updated Messages app, Apple appears to have borrowed a few of the standout features that make apps like WhatsApp so popular. You will now be able to record and send voice messages (and listen to them by lifting your iPhone to your ear), send multiple videos and photos at once, create groups and share locations with family and friends. So, does that mean we don&rsquo;t need WhatsApp now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5284 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-17-at-13.11.58.png" alt="iOS 8 - messages" width="729" height="649" /><span class="caption">Image: send voice messages to friends and share your location.

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The notification bar was perhaps a bit of a gimmick on previous versions of iOS. That being said, things look set to change, as Apple has improved its functionality quite considerably.</p>
<p>You can now reply to messages, emails, calendar alerts, reminders and even Facebook messages all from the new notification bar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a revised multitasking interface. When you double tap the home button, you&rsquo;ll not only see a snapshot of the apps you have open, you&rsquo;ll now see the faces of the people you have recently been talking to, as well as your favourite contacts. Tap on them to start a call, compose a text or initiate a FaceTime video call.</p>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>One of the biggest shouts about iOS 8 is that Apple has finally opened the door to developers, which means that you&rsquo;ll be able to tailor your device more than ever.</p>
<p>Android has been doing this for years, and its advocates often criticise iOS for a lack of third-party support. But, alas, those criticisms can no longer stand ground. As, for example, iOS 8 now enables you to pick and choose between multiple keyboards to suit your style.</p>
<p>Though you may wish to stick with Apple&rsquo;s native keyboard, as it has seen its biggest overhaul to date. Predicative text has finally joined in on the fun, and looking at what it can do, I&rsquo;d say it has been worth the wait.</p>
<p>The keyboard on iOS 8 will pick up the different styles of language you adopt with certain people, or on certain apps, and offer predictions based upon a finely tuned language analysis. It even recognises questions and offers a few choice responses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5282 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-17-at-10.54.27.png" alt="iOS 8 - predictive text" width="354" height="638" /><span class="caption">Image: iOS 8 recognises questions, and gives you some replies to choose from.

<h2>iCloud Drive</h2>
<p>iCloud Drive is pretty similar to apps like Google Drive, in as much as you can safely store all of your important files on the cloud, including images, videos, PDFs, spreadsheets and any other document. Anything you upload is readily available from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and PC.</p>
<p>What makes iCloud Drive one of the most intuitive features on iOS 8, is the fact that you can create or edit a document on one device, and it will be accessible and updated across all of your other devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5285 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-17-at-10.58.40.png" alt="iOS 8 - iCloud Drive" width="1002" height="618" /><span class="caption">Image: store all of your documents, safely, on iCloud Drive.

<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Think of the new Health app as a log for all of your medical and fitness data. It records everything you need to know, including your heart rate, how many calories you burn, your blood sugar and your cholesterol.</p>
<p>Health will even let you create an emergency card with details of any conditions you have, as well as an appropriate contact for medical assistance, which is accessible from the lock screen on your iPhone.</p>
<p>HealthKit gives developers access to your health data, or at least what you choose to give them access to. So, for example, you could share the amount of calories you consume on a daily basis with a healthy eating app, to create a more effective impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5286 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-17-at-11.00.10.png" alt="iOS 8 - Health" width="786" height="658" /><span class="caption">Image: record your medical and fitness information thanks to iOS 8.

<h2>Cross-device connectivity</h2>
<p>Handoff is an &uuml;ber cool, far-reaching and multifarious feature (and personally, my favourite) that allows you to start something, like writing an email or reading an article, on one Apple device and then pick it up where you left off on another. You just have to sign in to the same iCloud account and your iPhone, iPad and Mac will do the rest.</p>
<p>Handoff currently works with apps like Safari, Mail, Messages, Numbers, Keynote, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts and Maps, but since it&rsquo;s open to developers, you can expect that list to grow pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The fun doesn&rsquo;t quite finish there. You can also make and receive calls from your Mac and iPad, just like you would on your iPhone. You just have to set up your devices on the same Wi-Fi network. The same goes for both SMS and MMS text messages, too.</p>
<p>So if your iPhone starts ringing, but it&rsquo;s buried under a pile of clothes somewhere, just take the call using your iPad or Mac, and worry about finding your phone later.</p>
