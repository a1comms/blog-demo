<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It&rsquo;s been long-awaited, but it&rsquo;s finally here! (And no, it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the car)</span></p>
<p>We were expecting the release of the Nokia 9 at this year&rsquo;s MWC in Spain, but we couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong!</p>
<p>At the conference, the Nokia team hit us with a serious surprise that must have been up their sleeves for a while &ndash; the Nokia 8 Sirocco.</p>
<p>Aside from the name, the flagship device is everything we were hoping for and even packs a few little extras too. It really does look like a stellar phone. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Long gone are the days of old, clunky designs from the likes of Nokia. The 8 Sirocco is a stunning device, complete with a Gorilla Glass 5 casing and a somewhat minimal look. It also boasts a futuristic stainless steel frame and curved edges too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite plain to see that Nokia feels ready to take on some of the major players in the smartphone world here.</p>
<p>Touting a 5.5-inch Quad-HD+ Plastic OLED 18:9 display and a bezeless look, you can see where Nokia's going here.</p>
<p>Put this beast next to any of the leading devices on the market and it&rsquo;s sure to hold its own. What&rsquo;s more, adding the curved edges was something of a stroke of genius, offering a modern yet cool look to the phone.</p>

<h2>Specs and Features</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deal with the elephant in the room here. The Nokia 8 Sirocco features Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (along with a chunky 6GB RAM), rather than Qualcomm Snapdragon 845. You may find a lot of reviewers splitting hairs over this and complaining that it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;up to date&rsquo; enough. That&rsquo;s true, in some respects. However, for general phone use you&rsquo;ll barely notice the difference.</p>
<p>In terms of storage, you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with Nokia&rsquo;s latest offering. It comes with a whopping 128GB, which is more than enough room for you apps, music and photos. It&rsquo;s also got wireless charging (YES!) and a pretty hefty 3260mAh battery to boot that charges 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, all of the above are high-end when it comes to modern phone specs, which is sure to be a great sign.</p>
<p>But wait, what other Nokia 8 Sirocco features can you expect? Well, there&rsquo;s also the fact that it's IP67 waterproof rated, has a fingerprint scanner, and runs Android 8.0 Oreo. You can hardly complain.</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>The camera is decent enough here too. You can expect a dual-lens Zeiss model main camera with 12-megapixel and a 13-megapixel telephoto second lens. The selfie cam has a little less with a 5-megapixel lens, but it should be good enough for most selfie scenarios.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all that the device has to offer. Nokia clearly understands the importance of camera features, and so there&rsquo;s a Pro camera mode and a Portrait mode from which to choose.</p>
<p>These modes are certain to wow users and means that you&rsquo;ll get a little extra for your cash.</p>

<h2>Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>While the device has just been announced, you may have to wait a little while to get it. The official Nokia 8 Sirocco release date is set for April 2018. That may be tough for anyone who has been completely thrilled with what they&rsquo;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good news for those on a budget too. The device is going to cost a little less than many of the major flagship devices today.</p>
<p>The Nokia 8 Sirocco price should be around &pound;660 when it hits stores, with deals and contracts sure to be available too. Nice.</p>
