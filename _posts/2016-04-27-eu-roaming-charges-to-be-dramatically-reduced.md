<p>New EU regulations that drastically reduce roaming charges in member countries, are coming into effect from 30<sup>th</sup> April 2016.</p>
<p>The news means anyone heading to Europe from Saturday won&rsquo;t have to worry so much about making calls, sending texts, or logging on, with phone bills set to be comparatively diminished.</p>
<p>The EU has laid out its updated and far more agreeable price guide at 3p per minute, 1p per text and 3p per MB of data.</p>
<p>For comparison, Three&rsquo;s current UK customer rate sits as 16.6p per minute, 5.2p per text and 17.4p per MB.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;the EU&rsquo;s new prices don&rsquo;t include VAT, so the actual cost of using your mobile abroad will be charged at a slightly higher figure.</p>
<h2>The End of Roaming</h2>
<p>Things are evidently moving in the right direction, and from 15<sup>th</sup> June 2017, <em>all</em> EU roaming charges will be scrapped going forward, bringing in a golden age for&nbsp;UK vacationers.</p>
<p>To an extent, Three UK already offers such a perk, with its Feel At Home service that allows customers to use their mobile in 19 global destinations, at no extra cost, including Spain and France.</p>
<p><strong>Just for your information, the UK leaving the EU won&rsquo;t affect the plan to abolish roaming charges. Come summer 2017, travelling Brits will still reap all the benefits.</strong></p>
