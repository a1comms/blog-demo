<p><span class="postStandFirst">Over the years, many people have talked about the potential benefits of building a &lsquo;kill switch&rsquo; into mobile phones, and now, a figure has been released which helps to quantify how much of a benefit this feature would be, in financial terms.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/13604777473_3d00afe2ea_o.jpg" width="448" height="300" /></p>
<p>According to research done by William Duckworth PhD, of&nbsp;Creighton University, having a kill switch built into mobile phones, one that could be activated to render the phone useless if it&rsquo;s stolen, could save consumers in the region of $2.6billion (the equivalent of around &pound;1.5billion) every year!</p>
<p>This is, of course, on top of the fact that it might well make theft of mobile phones less prevalent. Muggers would be far less inclined to steal your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>&nbsp;or your&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;if they knew that the phone would be left as a non-working, and thus essentially&nbsp;<em>worthless</em>, brick. The central idea behind Professor Duckworth&rsquo;s research is that it would that the monetary benefit would happen as a result of reducing the amount of theft; with less theft, people might not feel it necessary to pay insurance premiums against their phone being stolen.</p>
<p>There are some problems with the report, of course, in that people could still steal phones for their parts, although it is likely that a kill switch would indeed lower the amount of theft.</p>
<p>The other important point is that insurance doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;cover the phone against theft, and it also offers peace of mind against your phone being&nbsp;<em>damaged</em>, something that a kill switch would do nothing to prevent.</p>
<p><strong>Still, while having insurance is definitely still a good idea (because accidents and cracked screens&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;happen), it&rsquo;s hard to argue against something that might make society itself a nicer place!</strong></p>
