<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new phone is rumoured to be on the way from HTC, and it seems to be designed specifically to take on the Samsung Galaxy S5. It&rsquo;s rumoured to be called the HTC M8 Ace, and while it is broadly similar to the HTC One M8, it will purportedly have a lower price, which could allow it to pose a serious threat to the Galaxy S5.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7029/13561010133_7c11938eea.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></strong></p>
<p>The HTC One M8 is a <em>superb</em> phone, with its incredibly powerful specs and sumptuous metal body making it one of the most desirable smartphones on the market. And now, if the rumour is true, there&rsquo;s a <em>new</em> version on the way.</p>
<p>According to Engadget, this rumoured new phone is called the HTC M8 Ace, and if the details that have been leaked are indeed accurate, this could end up being one seriously intriguing phone.</p>
<p>The best way to describe it is thus: imagine the HTC One M8, then change its aluminum body to a plastic shell, while keeping specifications that are around the same as the <a title="Samsung Galaxy S5" href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> (with a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, and a 5-inch 1080p screen). And <em>then</em>, imagine that HTC has given it a lower cost, thanks to the new plastic body.</p>
<p>That, in essence, is what the plastic HTC M8 Ace is rumoured to be like.</p>
<p>However, what&rsquo;s not clear is whether the rumoured phone (if it does indeed exist) will have the same Duo Camera found in the HTC One M8, although whether it does or not, it seems likely that it will use an UltraPixel sensor for capturing images.</p>
<p>If this rumour does prove to be true, the HTC M8 Ace could pose a serious threat to the market dominance of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (and if it is real, it seems likely that HTC has designed it <em>as </em>an &lsquo;S5-Killer&rsquo;), thanks to the high-end specs and lower price.</p>
<p><strong>For the moment, though, it remains an unsubstantiated rumour. Nonetheless, we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this one, so stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
