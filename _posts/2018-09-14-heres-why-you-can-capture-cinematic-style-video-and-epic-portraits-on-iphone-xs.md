<p>This week Apple unveiled its new iPhone, not one, but three of them! What a treat.</p>
<p>This year Apple spent a lot of time in its keynote showcasing its camera and video improvements to give you the best mobile photography and videography experience possible. Here&rsquo;s the lowdown on the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Xs</a>, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone XR camera setups.</p>

<h2>iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone XR: Say Hello to a New Era of Photography</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of a theme when it comes to all the camera features on iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone XR, they&rsquo;re pretty damn awesome!</p>
<p>A dual-camera system with wide-angle and telephoto lens, is even more advanced than before on iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. With improvements to its sensors, processors and algorithms, all to help capture the best shot, every time.</p>
<p>iPhone XR sports a single lens 12-megapixel camera with the same advancements in sensors and tech as the iPhone Xs models.</p>
<p>Combining these new advancements with Smart HDR on all three iPhone models, you&rsquo;ll capture photos with even more detail than before. With more natural highlights and shadows to in your shots, your photos will look professionally shot (I think we all want a bit of that).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18644" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EJjhEJxgK6wIquHZdKCqLmr2wAm-UIsdpIJ92UkDdX9Kqo73Y7g6dEWj-2ft8skYmkKQd2fjC5ebUnw4j058npE=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re all about those selfies and <em>Like </em>worthy pics, you&rsquo;ll want to listen up. New Bokeh effect with Depth Control allows you to manually apply your own focus to photos.</p>
<p>This feature will let you capture studio grade portrait shots and epic selfies from its TrueDepth camera system, found on its front-facing camera.</p>
<p>The technology behind capturing the perfect portrait shot is frankly scary. There&rsquo;s face detection, landmarking (allowing you to apply Lighting effect) and depth mapping of the photo subject. Not only that, once you&rsquo;ve captured your shot, you can add lighting effects and depth of field to your portraits to make them look even more amazing.</p>
<p>With Portrait Lighting there&rsquo;s five effects to choose from, delivering studio style finishes to your photos, including Natural, Studio, Contour, Stage and Stage Mono effects.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the attention to detail that makes your photos look even more impressive; and with improved performance in low-light and more capability to capture action shots &ndash; thanks to faster sensors and shutter speeds, these iPhone cameras are easily among the best out there.</p>
