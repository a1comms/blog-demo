<p>Apple lovers, have we got a treat for you. If you adore the retro Macintosh design, here&rsquo;s a concept video that&rsquo;s certainly going to pique your interest.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which Apple had taken a different approach to its first line of smartphones. Yes, rather than the cool glass-look phones we know and love, the team could have stuck with what they knew best.</p>
<p>Back in the day, the global tech company became somewhat renowned for the unmistakable Macintosh and iMac G3 looks.</p>
<p>For the time, these designs were real trailblazers and redefined how home PCs looked. Complete with bright colours and simple keyboards, the gadgets would set the template for the computers of the era.</p>
<p>With that in mind, things could have gone quite differently when it came to Apple&rsquo;s other gadgets and technology.</p>
<p>There was no reason for the design team to change tack here. They could quite easily have kept the same style when designing the iPod, iPad and iPhone. The mind boggles at the thought of it all.</p>
<p>So, how would the latter have looked exactly?</p>
<h5>Check out the Concept Video</h5>
<p>Luckily, we have the answer to that question. Expert designer, FuturePunk, decided to experiment with an interesting digital 3D mockup.</p>
<p>In the video, we get to peek at how a retro Macintosh-style iPhone might have looked. It also includes some recreated iPhone adverts, complete with the brand new (or, rather, old!) look.</p>
<p>Check out the quick video here:</p>

<p>Needless to say, the graphics here are impressive. However, frankly, these versions of the iPhone would not be practical at all.</p>
<p>First of all, they use the old T9 keyboards, which would make texting and writing in general a nightmare. The phones also look clunky and bulky. Since modern-day devices are getting slimmer and slimmer, this style does not gel at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a couple of design features that are quite attractive. Let&rsquo;s be honest, the colourful transparent back on the iMac G3 concept is quite quirky.</p>
<p>It has that retro Apple charm that won it so much love back in the 1990s. A style like this one would certainly turn a few heads down the local pub, if only for novelty value.</p>
<p>Want to get your hands on one of these cool, retro smartphones? Sadly, these are merely concepts, which means that they won&rsquo;t be hitting shops.</p>
<p>While we won&rsquo;t be seeing the phones in the flesh anytime soon (sigh!), it&rsquo;s fun to imagine what they may have looked like. Interesting!</p>
