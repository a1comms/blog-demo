<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Will the iPhone survive? Place your bets now!</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a> landed last month and, we&rsquo;re not going to beat around the bush, it's a remarkable piece of technology. Boasting a cool minimal design, a futuristic A12 Bionic chip, and the latest features, it has to be one of the best flagship devices we&rsquo;ve seen in a while.</p>
<p>So, it was only a matter of time before some heinous person decided to put it to the&hellip; drop test!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16399" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Oy1Cu4HqTsgKI8ZS3FF5UR51GDO320n3ydSqKP9Kmms8C2pKCKnE_hj29OtKKQ5Qp80ZP4fMTQEWxUnR97vSECdm1Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, these type of videos on YouTube are a huge deal these days. You might have witnessed a few of the more extreme ones before now. In the past, we&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/can-samsung-galaxy-s9-survive-a-drop-test-from-1000-ft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phones dropped from 1000 ft</a> and even the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-7-drop-test-from-the-worlds-tallest-building" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world&rsquo;s tallest building</a>.</p>
<p>But, for a moment, let&rsquo;s move away from these crazy scenarios. What would happen if you dropped your <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone Xs</a> from a normal height? Would it <em>seriously</em> survive?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19122" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qDO__QJwCb6GbRMParcjzNekLB6NRJGZnSjKwDmYGqns2SMgDr-oiOCq39YGxuKaNOFemY4Tb4qq7kzVi1GMVM_t=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a question that you won&rsquo;t have to ponder for too long. We have the answer right here. Yes, YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFKCr40YwOZQx8FHU_ZqqQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JerryRigEverything</a>, did the unthinkable and decided to put the newest device&nbsp;to the test.</p>
<p>When the phone was announced, Apple stated that it had the &lsquo;most durable glass ever on a smartphone.' It&rsquo;s time to see whether it lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Apple changed anything with the new iPhone Xs? Is the glass somehow more durable?&rdquo; Questions Jerry (as I will now be calling him&hellip; Hi, Jerry!), in the brief description on his YouTube channel. &ldquo;The only way to find out is with a drop test. On my channel, I like to keep things pretty standard and realistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To conduct the test, Jerry used two brand new iPhone Xs models. One was completely naked and the other was wrapped in Amazon&rsquo;s &lsquo;absolute cheapest case&rsquo; which, the Jerry says, cost around $5 (approx. &pound;4). After some mild chit-chat about the diabolical plan he&rsquo;d hatched, he got down to business and *gasp* dropped these high-end pieces of tech repeatedly. Here&rsquo;s what happened next:</p>
<p><em>Warning: If the thought of someone dropping a brand new iPhone Xs on the floor gives you the jitters, you might want to look away now.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKayUI0sppQ?start=152" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Jerry might have been a sceptic when it came to the strength of Apple&rsquo;s durable glass but this test proved him wrong.</p>
<p>Aside from a few minor scratches in some of the tests, the iPhone Xs models came out on top. You could see the surprise sweep across Jerry&rsquo;s face when he realised just how far wrong he had been to question the device. Even the so-called &lsquo;naked&rsquo; phone was able to take some drops without being shattered.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Of course, here at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buymobiles</a>, we&rsquo;re all about protecting your smartphone. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just common sense. Putting your smartphone in a case might not always be necessary, as this video shows. However, it&rsquo;s better to be safe than a sorry mess weeping on the floor when your brand new phone gets a scratch! Wrap that baby up.</p>
