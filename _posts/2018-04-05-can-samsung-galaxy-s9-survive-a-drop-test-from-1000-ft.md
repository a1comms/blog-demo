<p>The brand, spanking new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> is a beast of a phone. The snazzy flagship device is packed full of the latest tech, has a space-aged minimal design, and a seriously large screen. What more could you want?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about getting your hands on one of these beauties, you may be wondering just one little thing: Can it survive a 1000 ft drop?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important question. One day, you may find yourself flying through the air like Superman and worry about what may happen should your phone fall from your pocket. Or, more likely, you drop it on your face from a lofty height when browsing in bed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17145" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4A-ZuZmMZM18hE4wmRaEesAXizOPdjNNmOVkS64ySN3MJSw3bKUhRRJoSlk2BvWJTlJNOi92gPGHZtfLAFdxWdXJ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well, we have the answer. The good (or very, very <em>bad</em>, depending on your perspective) people on YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFpJKyIywUc8arDxhABGPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnlockRiver.com</a>, decided to put it to the test. After unboxing a shiny Samsung Galaxy S9, they did the absolute unthinkable. Yes, they tied it to a drone, lifted it a whopping 1000 ft in the air, and dropped it.</p>
<p>The test may have been an extreme one, but it&rsquo;s worth seeing for yourself. If you&rsquo;re at all curious about what happened here, check out the short YouTube clip for yourself here:</p>
<p><em>Note: If you&rsquo;re at all squeamish about seeing beautifully crafted technology at risk, you may want to look away now!</em></p>

<p>So, did Samsung Galaxy S9 survive? Well, the short answer would be a big, fat no.</p>
<p>On first inspection, the YouTube presenter found that the phone&rsquo;s exterior was completely shattered and that the casing itself was bent. When he looked a little closer, it was clear that the front of the phone was also smooshed and the device seemed completely dead.</p>
<p>No surprises there then!</p>
<p>However, after cleaning up the phone a little and taking a proper look at it, the team found that it wasn&rsquo;t entirely broken.</p>
<p>While the screen no longer worked, the Samsung device could still receive calls and make sounds too. Impressive. What&rsquo;s more, the finger sensor still worked as did the charging port.</p>
<p>Of course, it should go without saying that you shouldn&rsquo;t try this at home. Even if you do happen to have a drone and a flair for curiosity, it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry!</p>
