<p><span class="postStandFirst">Although it has been quite the wait, the Moto X has made it to our side of the pond, but can this unique phone justify all the hype?</span></p>
<p>We have been lucky enough to get our hands on the fabled Google-infused Motorola flagship, the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/motorola/motorola-moto-x"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moto X</span></a>. Originally only available in America and Brazil, this fantastic bit of mobile tech has finally graced us with its presence in the UK, but the question is, was it worth the wait? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" style="width: 370px; height: 500px;" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/12071201264_0608df2b84.jpg" width="370" height="500" /></strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubting that the Moto X is a beauty. The design of the handset is sleek, compact and stylish, and it feels extremely well built. The front of the handset is minimalistic and features a stunning 4.7 inch edge-to-edge 720p AMOLED display. The device fits in the hand perfectly, mainly due to a curved back design and non-slip finish, and the rear features a slight indent which your finger sits in to provide extra grip. The back of the phone also houses the 10 megapixel camera, LED flash and loudspeaker.</p>

<p>The Moto X houses a 4.7 inch 720p AMOLED display that is near edge-to-edge which assists in the compact design of the phone. The screen is stunning and there is very little difference in viewing quality compared to a 1080p unit, colours are vibrant and text is crisp. The reason Motorola chose a 720p display instead of a 1080p one is simple, it uses less power. The idea with the Moto X is to make things as power-friendly as possible, and a 1080p unit wouldn&rsquo;t accomplish that.</p>
<h2><strong>Hardware</strong></h2>
<p>This is where the Moto X gets very interesting indeed as the device has its own custom-built system known as the X8 system. This is effectively 8 cores comprising of several different elements, with a 1.7GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, a quad- core Adreno 320 GPU, a contextual processor which knows when the phone is in your pocket, and finally there is a natural language processor which is part of the Moto X&rsquo;s Touchless control function. Running alongside this unique arrangement is 2GB or RAM, so all together this means that the Moto X is a surprisingly fast and efficient smartphone with a fair few neat tricks up its sleeve. Powering the handset is a 2200mAh battery, which doesn&rsquo;t sound very large compared with the 3000mAh batteries that are used on the competition but thanks to the low power consumptive processor and screen, the Moto X has amazing battery life and can easily keep going for over 24 hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p>This is an area where the Moto X really comes into its own. By incorporating Google Now in with a language processor Motorola has taken voice control to the next level. Unlike most voice systems where the user must press and hold a button or activate a certain screen, the Moto X can be dormant and will react to your voice without the need to wake the phone up. The really clever thing with this system is that the device learns your own voice so it&rsquo;s only you who can control it meaning there is no need to worry that your phone will be activated by someone else. Touchless control allows the user to search Google, set reminders and alarms, and call or text contacts.</p>
<p>Another feature that is exclusive to the Moto X is Active Display. Thanks to the contextual processor the phone is aware of its surroundings and will instantly light up when you take it out of your pocket and show information such as the time and any messages you might have. This feature saves battery and also the inconvenience of having to unlock the device to see what content is waiting for you.</p>
<h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2>
<p>The Moto X has a rather unique camera too, the rear of the phone houses a 10 megapixel camera that is dubbed a Clear Pixel camera. This is a hybrid snapper that utilises some of the UltraPixel technology that is found on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HTC One,</span> so low light capture is superb. The camera user interface is simple and intuitive an,d thanks once again to that contextual processor, activating the camera can be done by simply twisting the wrist, and image capture by tapping the screen. Image quality is sharp and clear and the device supports HD video recording and HDR imaging.</p>
<h2><strong>Software</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="width: 500px; height: 370px;" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/12070789825_54227423ff.jpg" width="500" height="370" /></p>

<p>Running on the latest build of Android, KitKat 4.4 with very little customisation, means that the Moto X feels more like a Nexus product than the manufacturer&rsquo;s heavily tweaked device. There is Motorola&rsquo;s own software additions to the platform of course, but only a few to enable the stand-out features like the Active Display. The Moto X is very much Google but retains enough personality to ensure it&rsquo;s not just another Nexus smartphone.</p>
<h2><strong>Connectivity</strong></h2>
<p>Being a flagship means a host of connectivity options, so you can expect to find NFC, 4G, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi all on board. There is a non-expandable memory in the Moto X which comes in two flavours of either 16GB or 32GB, so plenty of space for your favourite content can be downloaded or transferred by USB for you to enjoy on the move.</p>
<p><strong>The Moto X is one of those rare technological gems that comes along and makes you smile, everything from the design to the unique feature set is tailored for simplicity and functionality. It really sends a message to manufacturers who are constantly trying to create the most powerful processor or the highest pixel density screen and says it&rsquo;s not all about numbers. The device is a real breath of fresh air and fits itself perfectly into your lifestyle, this may be the first Motorola phone since Google purchased them, but time, effort and care has gone into making the Moto X an amazing piece of smartphone history.</strong></p>
