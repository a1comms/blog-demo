<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Good news for Three customers!</span></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash;&nbsp;Monday is officially the <em>worst </em>day of the week. The moment that your alarm starts to beep, you know what&rsquo;s coming. The first day of the working week is never going to be one that floods you with sheer joy. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a little something that might perk you up. At least, if you happen to be a Three customer, that is.</p>
<p>The network provider is offering an epic deal that means you can grab a &pound;3 pizza every Monday up until the 10th December. All you need to do is make sure that you have the <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/wuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wuntu app</a> first. Then, it&rsquo;s simply a case of picking the pizza you fancy.</p>

<h2>How to Get the Deal</h2>
<p>Is your tummy rumbling at the thought of chowing down on a freshly baked slice of cheesy goodness? We hear you! If you fancy making Monday a little more bearable, nabbing yourself this deal is the only way to go. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h5>Step 1: Open the Wuntu app</h5>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have the Wuntu app, now&rsquo;s your chance to download it. Open it up and head to the Dominos deal. Press &lsquo;Use now&rsquo; to get your special code.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Head to the Domino&rsquo;s Site</h5>
<p>Next, you need to go to the main Domino's website or, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live near to a Domino's restaurant (hurrah!), head down there.</p>
<h5>Step 3: Choose Your Pizza</h5>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to have some fun and really get your mouth watering. Take a look at the menu and select one small (9.5-inch sized) pizza. Go ahead!</p>
<h5>Step 4: Use Your Special Code</h5>
<p>You need to use your special Wuntu code if you happen to be ordering online. Otherwise, you can just show it to the store assistant when buying your pizza.</p>
<h5>Step 5: Eat Your &pound;3 Pizza!</h5>
<p>The code will mean that you get your pizza at a discounted price of just &pound;3! You really can&rsquo;t say fairer than that, am I right? Then, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do &ndash;&nbsp;enjoy your meal.</p>

<h2>You&rsquo;d Better Be Fast!</h2>
<p>Sound good? Of course, it does. As with all deals, though, there are a couple of catches that you need to keep in mind. You can&rsquo;t use the voucher code on either the &lsquo;Create Your Own&rsquo; or &lsquo;Half &amp; Half&rsquo; pizzas. Plus, there are only 6,000 codes available each day. So, if you&rsquo;re hoping to get the deal today, you&rsquo;d better be fast.</p>
