<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Get three months of free&nbsp;football, rugby and loads more - only with EE!</span></p>
<p>EE pay monthly mobile and tablet customers can access three months of BT Sport on their EE phone or connected tablet, totally free of charge.</p>
<p>Home to Champions League and Europa League football, as well as 42 live Premier League games for the 16/17 season, BT Sport is the go-to destination for football fanatics.</p>
<p>But it's not just the footie, EE customers who claim free BT Sport also have access to oodles of other sports channels, coverage of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) Aviva Premiership Rugby, SPFL (Scottish Professional Football League), European Rugby Champions Cup and Moto GP.</p>

<h2>How to Get BT Sport Free for 3&nbsp;Months</h2>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be easier to set your free BT Sport subscription up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Text <strong>SPORT</strong> to <strong>150</strong></li>
<li>Download the BT Sport app</li>
<li>Set up a BT ID and login</li>
</ol>
<p>If you own an EE connected tablet, just call 07953 966 502.</p>
<h2>What Devices Can I Watch BT Sport On?</h2>
<p>Anyone on an iOS, Android or Windows tablet or smartphone can download the BT Sport app, and start their free 3-month subscription right away. Sadly, the app is only available to watch on these devices, so you can't beam games to your TV.</p>
<h2>Once Your Free Subscription Ends...</h2>
<p>Once your 3&nbsp;months are up, you can of course&nbsp;continue using the BT Sport app, but you will have to&nbsp;pay the going rate of &pound;5 a month. This will appear on your EE contract bill.</p>
<h2>What if I&rsquo;m Not On EE?</h2>
<p>Then you need to be.</p>
<p>Well, you could buy a BT Sport subscription, but then it wouldn&rsquo;t be free, would it? Get yourself &nbsp;a new mobile on EE and set yourself up for a glorious three months of free sporting action.
