<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You might be surprised at the number one bestselling mobile phone.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve been blessed with countless mobiles, evolving from simple feature phones to complex and capable smartphones.</p>
<p>The question we&rsquo;ve been wondering, though, is for all modern day smartphone&rsquo;s wonderful features, are they outselling the basic Nokia mobiles of days gone by?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we&rsquo;ve compiled the 20 bestselling mobile phones of all time. See how many you owned over the years. And see if you can guess which phone is number one&hellip;</p>
<h2>20) Samsung Galaxy S3</h2>
<p>At the back of the list is a phone that some say kick-started Samsung&rsquo;s dominance in the Android smartphone market&hellip; &nbsp;Released in 2012, Samsung Galaxy S3 was one of the best-looking devices, and featured a large (for the time) 4.7-inch HD screen, multi-core processor and an 8MP camera. Samsung sold more than 60 million units.</p>

<h2>19) Motorola StarTAC</h2>
<p>Way back in 1996, mobile phones started to become mainstream, thanks to Motorola StarTac. This clamshell style icon of a phone really gave the user something to show off, becoming the first big-seller for any mobile phone manufacturer.</p>

<h2>18) Apple iPhone 4s</h2>
<p>My personal favourite from Apple was iPhone 4s, and when launched in 2011, it became the iPhone that secured Apple its state of world dominance. The iPhone 4s was sold more than 60 million times across the globe and was the first device to feature Siri, Apple&rsquo;s personal digital assistant.</p>

<h2>17) Nokia 5130</h2>
<p>Back when Nokia was smashing out <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/10-nokia-mobile-phones-you-cant-believe-existed" target="_blank">weird, yet wonderful phones</a>, and before Microsoft took over, we had devices like Nokia 5130. Part of the Xpress music range, this mobile phone had dedicated music buttons, expandable memory and a 2MP camera (which was a big deal in 2007), selling more than 65 million units.</p>

<h2>16) Apple iPhone 5</h2>
<p>The first post-Steve-Jobs-iPhone was revealed in 2012, and was Apple&rsquo;s first larger handset. It sported a 4-inch display and slim profile, and was a huge hit for Apple, who eventually sold more than 70 million units.</p>

<h2>15) Nokia 6010</h2>
<p>Another offering from the Finnish brand, Nokia 6010 was released in 2004 and was aimed at the mid-tier market. It proved popular with consumers and sold over 75 million units.</p>

<h2>14) Samsung Galaxy S4</h2>
<p>Riding high on the success of the Galaxy S3, Samsung took everything that was great about its former flagship and made it even better. The Galaxy S4 had a stunning 1080p display, 13MP camera and some cool features like Smart Stay. It sold over 80 million.</p>

<h2>13) Apple iPhone 6 and 6 plus</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 6 twins where released in 2014, featuring a new design and advanced specs. The smaller of the two featured a 4.7-inch display, whilst the bigger was a bona fide phablet rocking a massive 5.5-inch Retina screen. Between them, they&rsquo;ve sold over 100 million units.</p>

<h2>12) Nokia 1208</h2>
<p>And another Nokia&hellip; this time the 1208, which was a more affordable phone for the masses back in 2007. Being sold more than 100 million times, it wasn&rsquo;t overly advanced, but got something&nbsp;right. The in-build torch was about as flashy as it got. See what we did there?</p>

<h2>11) Nokia 3310</h2>
<p>Owned by the majority of the population it always seemed, was the practically indestructible Nokia 3310. It was a personal favourite of mine, with iconic games like Snake and personalised ringtones. The casing was interchangeable too. It was a total smash hit, with Nokia shipping over 126 million.</p>

<h2>10) Motorola RAZR V3</h2>
<p>In 2004 Motorola lifted the lid on its, erm, <em>sharpest</em> phone to date&hellip; the stylish RAZR V3. This is Moto&rsquo;s bestselling device ever, not to mention the most popular clam-shell phone of all time! Famed for its stylish, super-thin design, the RAZR went on to sell more than 130 million units worldwide.</p>

<h2>9) Nokia 1600</h2>
<p>Built for emerging markets like India and China, the simple but solid Nokia 1600 brought cheap and cheerful mobile technology to the world. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot to call home about, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Nokia from selling more than 130 million units.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11239" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/Nokia-1600-1.jpg" alt="Nokia 1600" width="600" height="430" /></p>

<h2>8) Nokia 2600</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, Nokia ruled the roost during the era before smartphones. Yet another example of this is the Nokia 2600. Again, it was a low-end offering that did what it said on the tin, but was so popular that consumers bought an impressive 135 million + units.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11240" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/Nokia-2600.jpg" alt="Nokia 2600" width="600" height="278" /></p>
<h2>7) Samsung E1100</h2>
<p>Even after Samsung has launched amazing devices like the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank">Galaxy S7</a>, this feature phone from 2009 remains the tech brand&rsquo;s biggest seller. Called, the E1100, it was a tough little thing, housing a 13-day battery life, something we can only dream of now. Samsung sold over 150 million units.</p>

<h2>6) Nokia 6600</h2>
<p>Nokia&rsquo;s back on it at number 6, with the Nokia 6600. It was an odd, egg-shaped mobile phone, offering a better than average camera experience. It was what you would eventually dub as a smartphone, thanks to Symbian OS. Selling more than 150 million units back in 2004, despite the &pound;400 price tag, Nokia 6600 was damn popular.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11242" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/Nokia-6600.jpg" alt="Nokia 6600" width="525" height="500" /></p>
<h2>5) Nokia 5230</h2>
<p>Another of Nokia&rsquo;s music-centric phones that featured a touch screen, decent camera and ran on Symbian OS. The 5230 was a popular device in 2009, despite lack of WiFi support, selling 150 million + units.</p>

<h2>4) Nokia 1200</h2>
<p>Introduced in 2007, the Nokia 1200 was yet another simple feature phone from the Finnish brand, exploiting the lower end of the market. Boasting over 390 hours of battery life, this little number flew off the shelves to the tune of 150 million +.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11244" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/Nokia-1200.jpg" alt="Nokia 1200" width="476" height="500" /></p>
<h2>3) Nokia 3210</h2>
<p>The third bestselling of all time is Nokia 3210, again, generating over 150 million sales for Nokia. Hitting the market in 1999, it will forever be the first phone for millions of people, praised for its aerial-free design, swappable covers and customisable ringtones.</p>

<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2) Nokia 1110</h2>
<p>Taking second place is&hellip; Yet another Nokia. The Nokia 1110 was a small and simple offering. It featured a black screen with white text, and was apparently enough to earn Nokia more than 250 million sales after launching in 2005.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11248" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/nokia-1110-00-1.jpg" alt="nokia-1110-00" width="426" height="480" /></p>
<p><strong>And, the bestselling mobile phone of all time is&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><strong>*drum roll*</strong></p>

<h2>1) Nokia 1100</h2>
<p>Yep you guessed it&hellip; another Nokia!</p>
<p>OK, so the Nokia 1100 may not be as iconic as some of those in this list, but the numbers don&rsquo;t lie. Nokia shifted a staggering 250 million +, after going on sale in 2003. What was so great? Well, it had a decent battery life, like most feature phones back then, and that&rsquo;s more or less it by today&rsquo;s standards. Will any phone ever outsell it? Who knows&hellip;</p>
