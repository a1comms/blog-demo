<p><span class="postStandFirst">Are you switching from an iPhone to a new smartphone on Android or Windows Phone? Apple has created a new tool, which allows you to deregister iMessage, to help make the transition as smooth as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6024 aligncenter" alt="Deregister iMessage" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-11-at-09.50.59.png" width="946" height="378" /></p>
<p>Switching phones is usually completely painless, but there exists one slight issue that can happen when people switch from an iPhone to another smartphone that&rsquo;s <i>not</i> running on iOS. It&rsquo;s a well-known issue, and now, Apple has launched a way to fix it.</p>
<p>The new tool to deregister iMessage could be absolutely <i>vital</i> if you&rsquo;re switching from the iPhone to another platform!</p>
<p>The issue is caused by the way iMessage works: when sending a message to someone with, say, a Samsung Galaxy S5, that message is sent as an SMS, but when sending it to someone else with an iPhone, it sends it through the data connection, without sending it as a text message.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great benefit, as it lets you send unlimited free messages to your friend with, say, an iPhone 6, and it allows you to send messages through Wi-Fi if you don&rsquo;t have a mobile signal.</p>
<p>The problem comes if you switch your number to a non-iOS phone, because that friend&rsquo;s iPhone 6 will not know you&rsquo;ve switched phones, and will think you&rsquo;re still using iMessage. As such, it will send the message as data not an SMS, meaning you might not even get the message they send.</p>
<p>If you still have your old iPhone, you can resolve it by putting your new SIM in the old iPhone, going to &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; then &ldquo;Messages&rdquo;, and turning off the iMessage slider. But what if you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> still have your old iPhone?</p>

<p>Cue the web-based iMessage Deregistration tool...</p>
<p>All you need to do is enter your mobile number on the site, and Apple will send a message with a 6-digit code. Enter that code on the site, and <i>voila</i>, you will be deregistered and able to receive messages on your new phone without problems!</p>
