<p><span class="postStandFirst">Cooking is one of the nation&rsquo;s favourite pastimes, and in the modern world, the humble smartphone has the capability of becoming the ideal kitchen companion, letting you find recipes quickly and easily, without pulling out a big, heavy cookbook. We take a look at four of the best smartphones out there, to decide which is the perfect kitchen companion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4584" alt="smartphone cooking" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/smartphone-cooking-app-1024x725.jpg" width="576" height="407" /></p>
<p>Thousands of people round the country, of all genders and ages and backgrounds, love to cook. TV shows are on all the time, about cooking (including, it sometimes feels like, seventeen versions of <i>Masterchef</i>). But did you know that your smartphone can help you out in the kitchen?</p>
<p>Yes it may sound a little bit silly, but the simple fact is that the humble smartphone is perfectly poised to become the ultimate kitchen companion.</p>
<p>Just imagine it: instead of needing a big cookbook (with pretty pictures of food that usually look nothing at all like the calcined ember of an end result, in the case of this author, who can&rsquo;t cook very well), you just take your smartphone into the kitchen with you, fire up one of the myriad cooking apps from Google Play (or even just fire up the web browser, and find something like the BBC&rsquo;s food website), and there you go. Every recipe known to humanity, right there at your fingertips.</p>
<p>However, if that sounds like something you&rsquo;d love to try out, there&rsquo;s a question that needs to be answered first, and it&rsquo;s this: which smartphone makes for the <i>best</i> kitchen companion?</p>
<h2>iPhone 5s</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4319" alt="iphone tips" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/10688054314_8a959d0ff0.jpg" width="500" height="142" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with Apple&rsquo;s <i>wunderkind</i>, and unfortunately, we hit a potential snag: the screen on the iPhone 5s, while being rather brilliant, is smaller than any of rival top-end Android phones on the market. When looking for the perfect kitchen companion, a big screen seems like a must, as you can get more of the recipe onscreen at once, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to scroll as much, which could prove to be a good thing when your fingers are covered in chicken fat.</p>
<p>So, while the iPhone 5s is a great phone, we must look elsewhere...</p>
<h2>LG G3</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4308" alt="14103666858_3eec717bdf" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14103666858_3eec717bdf.jpg" width="343" height="350" />And so, we turn our attentions to the LG G3, a much better candidate with its massive, ultra-sharp screen. However, we run into another snag, here, because the kitchen could well be considered a hostile environment for phones, especially if there&rsquo;s spitting pans, a washing up bowl full of water, and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore we have to pass by the LG G3, as well, for one simple reason: while it&rsquo;s one of the best smartphones ever made, the simple fact is that it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> water-resistant...</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S5</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4498" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G800H_GS5-mini_Black_Duos_2.jpg" width="490" height="327" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn our attentions, then, to a smartphone that is water-resistant, as well as being one of the most popular smartphones currently on the market: the Samsung Galaxy S5. With its big screen, a fast data connection and a water-resistant body, it&rsquo;s pretty much perfect.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s one phone that might be even <i>more</i> perfect...</p>
<h2>Sony Xperia Z2</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4585" alt="xperia-z2-gallery-05-waterproof-super-durable-1240x840-e7a7800851058db44b43a4da0a970888" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/xperia-z2-gallery-05-waterproof-super-durable-1240x840-e7a7800851058db44b43a4da0a970888-1024x608.jpg" width="461" height="274" />It all comes down to the level of water-resistance, in the end, and looking at the certifications, the Sony Xperia Z2 is that bit more water-resistant than the Samsung, as it&rsquo;s rated to IP58, instead of IP67 (the first number being for dust-resistance, the second for liquids).</p>
<p>Oddly, though, that means that the Samsung is a better companion in <i>one</i> circumstance: when you&rsquo;re baking, and there&rsquo;s flour flying about the place.</p>
<p><b>Other than that one exception, though, everything points to one inescapable conclusion: while every phone on this list is <i>superb</i>, if you want the perfect kitchen companion, then the best smartphone for you is the gorgeous Sony Xperia Z2!</b></p>
