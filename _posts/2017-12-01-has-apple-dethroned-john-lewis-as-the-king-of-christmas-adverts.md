<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Watch Apple&rsquo;s new Christmas advert to find out.</span></p>
<p>There was a time when the Christmas advert was&hellip; well, just an advert &mdash;&nbsp;a short clip showing gleeful kids unwrapping presents, or a family enjoying a turkey dinner together. Nothing more, nothing less. It was a simpler time.</p>
<p>It was a time when we didn&rsquo;t <em>expect </em>all that much from the commercial break between shows; when, frankly, we hurried out to the kitchen to make a cuppa, hoping desperately that we could get back in time for part two.</p>
<p>Then Christmas 2011 happened. It was the year that John Lewis changed everything.</p>
<p>That's because 2011 was the year John Lewis released its first Christmas advert, in the lead up to the big day, and it was more like a beautifully shot short film than anything else.</p>
<p><em>The Long Wait</em>, as it was called, showed a small boy waiting patiently to give his parents a present. Set against the backdrop of <em>Slow Moving Millie </em>singing a rendition of The Smiths&rsquo; <em>Please, Please, Please</em>, it was enough to melt even the iciest of hearts.</p>

<p>With that one-minute, thirty-second advert, a new era was born. Since then, the biggest names from the likes of Sainsbury&rsquo;s to Unicef have taken part in the creative tradition. What&rsquo;s more, for us lucky viewers, when the festive season comes around, we once again get a chance to see some of the finest shorts in the form of adverts.</p>
<p>So, six years after John Lewis&rsquo; first Christmas advert aired, which company is topping the charts with their Christmas offering?</p>
<p>Well, you may have already seen this year&rsquo;s John Lewis advert. It comes complete with a handy hashtag #MoxTheMonster, and features a boy trying desperately to get some sleep, but failing since the monster under his bed won&rsquo;t let him. Of course, come the big day, the friendly monster gives him a special present &mdash; sleep. You can watch it here:</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s a decent enough attempt, in my opinion, #MoxTheMonster has nothing on John Lewis&rsquo; previous attempts at spreading the festivities. That means that there&rsquo;s room for another company to swoop in and take the top spot. So, which will it be?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one advert in particular that has a real shot. Produced by none other than Apple, the below Christmas advert tells a story of a man and a woman falling gently in love, with a little help from Sam Smith and a pair of AirPods. Watch it here:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s basically a modern-day romance. As the leading lady bumps into a man on the street, she slips an AirPod into his ear and the two continue to dance and perform some incredible gymnastic feats together. An epic story, jaw-dropping choreography, and a sprinkling of love to boot; the advert really does have it all. Still, will it be enough to dethrone John Lewis? Decide for yourself.</p>
