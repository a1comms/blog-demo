<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Oooooh, Samsung just got burnt!</span></p>
<p>Ah, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7; it had such great potential, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>When it first hit UK stores back in September, the Note 7 looked as though it was all set to be a real contender in the tech world. People were quick to tout it as an iPhone killer, and an inevitable, but brief, battle ensued over which device would be crowned king of the smartphones.</p>
<p>Sadly, it was a battle that the Note 7 was destined to lose - and not because of any shortcomings in its features. On paper, it ticked all the right boxes&hellip;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11132" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/08/note-7-entertainment.jpg" alt="note-7-entertainment" width="600" height="261" /></p>
<p>Soon after the phone&rsquo;s release, however, there were reports of the gadget overheating, smoking, and even exploding. When those complaints turned out to hold substance, the world looked to Samsung to see what the manufacturer would do next. Needless to say that the gadget was deemed unsafe and has <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-sales-postponed">now been discontinued</a>.</p>
<p>Since the reported incidents, Samsung has been doing its best to prevent any more damage to its brand, and has recalled the phones in question. We&rsquo;re guessing that this episode is something Sammy hopes its customers will forget as soon as possible.</p>
<p>That may be easier said than done, though, since there are some people out there who want the memory of the exploded phones to live on and on&hellip;</p>
<h2>The Explo-Sung iPhone Skin</h2>
<p>In what can only be described as the ultimate <em>burn</em>, a US tech case website is now ranging the Explo-Sung iPhone Skin &ndash; a case that makes your iPhone look like an exploded Note 7. There are versions that will fit everything from iPhone 5 up to iPhone 7 Plus, and it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious. Well, maybe not to Samsung&hellip;<br />

<p>The case itself is black like the original Samsung models, but its prize feature is the large and authentic-looking pattern that make it appear as though your iPhone has burnt all the way through. Some versions appear to even display a partial Samsung logo on the back, although the one available on <a href="https://www.uniqfind.com/collections/all/products/explo-sung-iphone-skin?variant=30234184396" target="_blank">www.uniqfind.com</a> doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Whether Samsung will pursue any legal action over this exploding Note 7 case, we don&rsquo;t know. Although it did recently have YouTube pull a video in which Grand Theft Auto video game footage was modified, turning replacing grenades with Note 7s&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sure Samsung has bigger fish to fry right now, but since it&rsquo;s is a trademarked name, the company would have every right to sue the pants off the designer! So&hellip; watch this space.</p>
