<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">When they start blowing up, you have to admit there&rsquo;s been a mistake&hellip;</span></p>
<p>While 2016 has been one of weirdest years on records, one of the most interesting and, yes, disturbing tech stories has been that of the Galaxy Note 7.</p>
<p>It was to be Samsung&rsquo;s next best handset, set to be a massive success, nevertheless early users soon found that there was just one small problem with it.</p>
<p>After reports began to simmer claiming some Note 7 units were overheating, and, worse, catching fire, there was a lot of <em>bad</em> attention directed Samsung&rsquo;s way. One opportunist even launched the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/this-case-turns-your-iphone-into-an-exploded-galaxy-note-7" target="_blank">Explo-Sung iPhone Case</a>, which as you might guess turns your iPhone into an exploded Note 7.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11892 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/Expl-Sung-Back-View_grande.jpg" alt="expl-sung-back-view_grande" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Once the reports were confirmed as more than mere rumour, the tech giant began replacing the affected devices with new models, which were of course supposed to be totally safe. But, alas, that was not the end of Samsung&rsquo;s strife; not by any means.</p>
<p>Early in November, the world was shocked when a &lsquo;safe&rsquo; Samsung Galaxy Note 7 device caught fire on a plane. Now, this was a phone that Samsung had deemed safe and doled out as an alternative to the affected devices (i.e. the ones that <em>will </em>catch fire). The fact that the replacements were the same issues was&nbsp;game over.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that just a few days after this worrying incident made the news, Samsung stopped production of the Note 7 altogether. You might think that the story ends there, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You see, this unsavoury episode has hurt Samsung&rsquo;s reputation, and sometimes, when you&rsquo;re wrong, you just have to come out and say so.</p>
<p>Not wanting customers to lose love for its brand, Samsung took to its own website to issue an open letter to the public. Here&rsquo;s what the folks at Samsung wrote regarding the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">To our valued customers,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">At Samsung, we innovate to deliver breakthrough technologies that enrich people&rsquo;s lives. An important tenet of our mission is to offer best-in-class safety and quality. Recently, we fell short on this promise.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">Because we had not gone on general sale in Europe with the Note7, there were a small number of affected customers here. For those customers who received the device during the pre-order phase, we recognize that we have not lived up to your expectations, or our own high standards. For this we are truly sorry.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">We take seriously our responsibility to address concerns about safety and quality. In collaboration with government agencies and industry partners around the world, we are taking proactive steps to do better. Here is an update of our actions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">As you have heard &ndash; or experienced personally &ndash; we have stopped production of the Galaxy Note7. We are working swiftly to ensure every Note7 device is safely returned. For those directly affected, we appreciate your patience throughout the replacement process.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">Samsung is fully committed to identifying and addressing the source of the Note7&rsquo;s battery issue. We have already initiated investigations with independent third party experts to carefully revisit every aspect of the device, including the battery, hardware and software, and manufacturing processes. Once available, we will transparently share our findings.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">Samsung has a long heritage of innovation and we have shown that we can and will learn from our mistakes. While we are always looking to innovate and create the next generation of great consumer technology, safety will remain our top priority. We will invest to better serve your needs through enhanced customer care and quality assurance.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">On behalf of all our employees across Europe, we are truly sorry, and grateful for your ongoing support. We will listen to you, learn from this and act in a way that allows us to win back your trust.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">YH Eom</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">President and CEO - Samsung Electronics Europe</span></p>

Remember, it takes a lot of courage to come out and admit you&rsquo;ve made a mistake, so you&rsquo;ve got to give Samsung some credit. Right now, it&rsquo;s unclear what will happen with the Galaxy Note 7 devices, but it looks like Samsung is hoping we will forgive and forget, and all move on from 2016. After recent political events in the US, we promise to at least try to.</p>
