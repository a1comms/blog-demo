<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Nokia 3310, the world's most loved mobile, is back!</span></p>
<p>The techy rumour mill has been spinning for quite some time, but now we finally have the confirmation we wanted: the classic Nokia 3310 is making a comeback later this year!</p>
<p>In fact, officials from the Nokia chose Mobile World Congress 2017 to unveil the revamped device and, frankly, it looks like a must-have have nostalgia-lovers.</p>

<p>This is what consumers have been asking us for, and so we decided that we&rsquo;d just do it and have some fun with it. That&rsquo;s the unique opportunity we have here at HMD with the Nokia brand,&rdquo; explained Florian Seiche, president of HMD.</p>
<p>The new Nokia 3310 will come in a range of new colours and the officials were keen to stress that it will have the same charm and unique identity as the 2000 model.</p>
<h2>Fresh Yet Familiar</h2>
<p>So, what differences can we expect to see in the revamped Nokia 3310? Well, for one thing, users will notice that the screen is slightly bigger than that of the original.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the new Nokia 3310 now has a colour display, which will allow users to better enjoy some of the new functions the phone has to offer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13373" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Arf1MHxxvJfC2JvC5eqTyX7gyYhkccufdPGeNIxRstkAr67JFlez6S1ECqiY_7q6DHcjwVmVXXdI_qa0pKgeDBBf=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a handy 2-megapixel camera on the back, which the original lacked. And whilst you&rsquo;re not likely to capture the world&rsquo;s best photos, it fits the retro characterises.</p>
<p>The new Nokia 3310 will run an updated version of the original S30 software. So you can bet that the user experience should be somewhat similar to that of the original 3310, if a little smoother.</p>
<h2>Snake, Better Than Ever</h2>
<p>Of course, this classic Nokia mobile phone would be nothing without everyone&rsquo;s favourite game: Snake.</p>
<p>The new colour version of the game will arrive pre-installed on all new Nokia 3310 models. So, once you&rsquo;ve invested in one of these little beauties, you can play the now retro game until your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<h2>An Unbreakable Bond</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that Nokia 3310 was so popular back when it first launched, was the near indestructible build. The public&nbsp;has&nbsp;resorted to some pretty drastic measures to put the 3310 to the test.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5seBNQb0M4?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The good people at Nokia have promised that the latest line of 3310 mobiles will be as unbreakable as the originals. Yet they&rsquo;re half the thickness of the 2000-model. and have a whopping one-month long standby time. Compared to the modern smartphones of today, that kind of battery life is unheard of.</p>
<h2>Nokia 3310 Availability</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering when you can get your hands on a new Nokia 3310, just for old time&rsquo;s sake, we have the answers.</p>
<p>Nokia will be releasing the new generation of 3310s in the second quarter of 2017. That means that the handset is likely to hit stores between April and June this year.</p>
<p>While the original phone cost &pound;129 back in 2000 when it was released, this latest model will have a much lower price tag, coming in at around just &pound;40. Bargain!</p>
