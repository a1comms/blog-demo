<p>If you&rsquo;ve got yourself a shiny iPhone X (or a newer iPhone Xs or Xs Max), and you want to feel like a spy, there&rsquo;s one feature you will be absolutely buzzing about.</p>
<p>Yes, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about &ndash; Face ID. Here&rsquo;s how to set it up and use it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18735" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BObXdhlR4K_MGyw43nIlT2G3aTOxwIfyBo8f_5HxnR98To5KSpK9cstpm5kDWnyzr0cqcCzYbDlq4bAGxCxqBQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>How to Set Up Face ID</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do the groundwork here. For the setup, you&rsquo;ll need to hold the selfie cam (i.e. the True Depth camera) around 10 to 20 inches away from your face. Make sure that there&rsquo;s nothing covering it while completing this process.</p>
<p>1) Go to Settings > Face ID &amp; Passcode. You may need to enter your passcode at this point too.</p>
<p>2) Simply tap Set Up Face ID and then Get Started.</p>
<p>3) You&rsquo;ll see a circular frame on your iPhone X or later. Look directly at it and make sure that your head fits inside the space.</p>
<p>4) When you&rsquo;ve done so, move your head slowly in a circular motion to complete.</p>
<p>5) After the first Face ID scan, tap Continue.</p>
<p>6) Then repeat the same process of slowly moving your head in a circular motion.</p>

<p>7) Finally, when you have done that, you need to tap Done. And that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<h2>Pay for Things Using Face ID</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got Face ID up and running, it&rsquo;s time to start using it. One of the cool things you can do with Face ID is authenticating purchases, i.e. buying things. (Note: You&rsquo;ll need to have Face ID turned on and Apple Pay set up on your iPhone before you use this feature.)</p>
<h5>How to Use Apple Pay and Face ID in Shops</h5>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a shop and want to use Apple Pay, just double-click the side (power) button on your iPhone X or later generation. That&rsquo;ll bring up your default card on the app. And here&rsquo;s where things get very high-tech...</p>
<p>All you do is glance at your iPhone screen to authenticate the Face ID request. Once that&rsquo;s done, simply hold your iPhone near a contactless reader until the payment is complete. You&rsquo;ll see a small tick with the message Done when it goes through.</p>

<h5>How to Use Apple Pay and Face ID in An App or Online</h5>
<p>Of course, you can also use Apple Pay when paying for things online with your iPhone.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using an app or shopping on a website, tap the Buy with Apple Pay option when available. Make sure that the card that comes up is the one that you want to use. Then, double-tab the side button and glance down at your phone. Wait for the purchase to complete. Simple.</p>
<h2>How to Unlock Your iPhone with Face ID</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the coolest tricks (or &lsquo;safety features&rsquo;) that you will find on iPhone X and later generations.</p>
<p>So, how can you unlock your iPhone using the super-futuristic Face ID? Well, once you&rsquo;ve set up Face ID, you need to make sure it&rsquo;s ready to be used. Go to Settings > Face ID &amp; Passcode and then tap iPhone Unlock.</p>
<p>Want to give it a whirl? First, pick your iPhone up to wake the display, or just go ahead and tap the screen. Then, glance down at it for a moment. You&rsquo;ll notice a little padlock symbol at the top of the screen. When the padlock symbol unlocks, your iPhone is ready to use. Simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to start navigating around.</p>
