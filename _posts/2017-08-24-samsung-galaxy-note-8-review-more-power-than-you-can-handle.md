<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Get all the inside knowledge on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, in a review that's out of this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung fans rejoice! The latest Note &lsquo;phablet&rsquo; is finally here. Needless to say, after the Note 7 fiasco, this device has a load of making up to do. Samsung just announced the device yesterday, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what this one has in store for us, shall we?</span></p>

<h2>Design: Easy to grip</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will get to the Infinity Display in just a moment, but for now, let&rsquo;s talk about the design as a whole. (It&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shiney!) One of the biggest changes here, though, is the curved edges of the device, which tend to make it simple to hold and grip. There&rsquo;s still a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, which may take some getting used to over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the large size of the phone and the fact that that it has a whole load of features, it is relatively lightweight. The glass follows suit and has a light, easy feel to it. While some may say that it&rsquo;s almost plastic-esque in the way that it feels, it&rsquo;s also very easy to hold and play around with. Overall, the look is simple and clean. Nice.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14723 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/boriLhl-LT9qJSNlHzdi3VhTGqG7sYvoMf1GCvwmKNYwkb5CeL6vxLYgtNmUiEQkkT3f7WQgBnr8HFeGoGo9JYM-=s0" alt="" width="600" height="348" /></p>
<h2>Display: to Infinity and beyond</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the main thing that everyone&rsquo;s going to be talking about when the device comes out is the screen. It&rsquo;s huge. Samsung 8 series devices have all had the Infinity Display, which is truly something to behold. The edge-to-edge design has proved to be a real winner. What&rsquo;s more, many other flagship devices seem to be getting on board with this one too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming in at a massive 6.3 inches, this is one of the largest phone screens that the world has ever seen! It&rsquo;s sure to be enough to catch many people&rsquo;s attention. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, it&rsquo;s a QHD+ screen and even packs Super AMOLED technology. Need we say more?</span></p>
<h2>Camera: better than ever</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera is one of the areas in which you will seriously notice a difference here. Samsung have clearly invested a lot of time and effort into making the snapper better than it has ever been before. This is something that&rsquo;s sure to delight tech fans.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14714 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bg86UV_AoR-MkHes-1J7OISnPXk2ayy-9ndGA6hKPsVqjwPztQ_zebcKqGDE_zkhkjILZWvB2Werv5bnUaZDc6pWXg=s0" alt="" width="600" height="283" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the rear of the device, for example, you&rsquo;ll find dual 12MP sensors, one of which is telephoto. What that means is that you can zoom in 200% on an image without losing its sharpness or clarity. There&rsquo;s also a feature that allows you to blur out the background of your image after you&rsquo;ve taken it. This extra level of control is a sure fire hit and adds a little something to your images. </span></p>
<h2>Performance: watch this space</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you may expect the device to be packing a serious amount of battery power, that is simply not the case. With just 3300mAh power pack, the phone is by no means ahead of the game in terms of power. Still, we will have to wait and see how the device fairs over time to know how this will affect its functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from that, it appears that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has been upgraded in almost every way, when you compare it to previous phones. It&rsquo;s got a whopping 6GB RAM, a mighty CPU, and a whole load of extra features (but we will get to that in a minute!). The performance on this thing is certain to be excellent. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 23px;">So, how about all the cool new features, continue to find out...</span></span></p>

<h2>Features: Bixby, the S Pen, and more</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But enough about what&rsquo;s under the hood, let&rsquo;s talk about what really matters &mdash; the features. Everyone is just gagging to know what this device can do and what new features they can expect. Here&rsquo;s the inside scoop: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bixby</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s by no means the first time that we&rsquo;ve seen Bixby, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we need to overlook it. The feature is an all-encompassing system, which comes in the form of Bixby Voice, Bixby Vision, and Bixby Home. You can either talk to the AI and tell it what you want it to do, use the home screen to adjust features on your phone, or use your camera to interact with things IRL.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14717 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TRMRzUJmoz_pxoOzop2cy8uHwJvMxXKGRxRU-twwybzVm52rBVdgUvaDq2f8VS5m6CtaEOJf8KxaKSoBRfxtTS8=s0" alt="" width="600" height="465" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The S Pen</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, one of the main selling points of the Note devices is the stylus or &lsquo;S Pen&rsquo; that comes with them. This time, the feature is more sensitive than ever before, which means that you can do a whole load more with it. The idea is that, when you use the pen, it should feel as though you&rsquo;re writing on paper.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14715 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7vVIttDDM7kEqUDgIj4DLsMgs6kP-TirjzAcBX_HZh6v0B6Odd8myIAhXIpRJeS7UBM1-1W2OS2XpaoZcwPCMtfo=s0" alt="" width="600" height="283" /></p>
<p><strong>Extra features</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is by no means lacking in features! There&rsquo;s a whole lot that users will adore here, including the fingerprint sensor, the DeX desktop experience, and an iris scanner. With that in mind, Samsung fans will need hours to truly unlock all of the features and use them. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14716 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m7WXHIUHt0ms377k5GWyTbVa3IZ0k9TJ24XX2EcAZ1ETtIlMP44Kb8R9yVIXSjn0HLRJ86t5UBwhvo_Ki0VYUfE=s0" alt="" width="600" height="283" /></p>
<h2>Price tag and release date</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when will we be seeing this device in public? Well, the wait is (almost) over. You can already pre-order your Samsung Galaxy Note 8 right now and it should be hitting shops around the UK by mid-September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get your hands on one of these beauties, though, you should know that they run a little more expensive than other flagship devices. To buy the phone without an airtime plan, will cost you &pound;869.&nbsp;</span></p>
