<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You probably don&rsquo;t need reminding, but your iPhone is pretty darn amazing.</span></p>
<p>We all have our allegiances. Some of us are Team Android, some are Team Apple. It&rsquo;s an ongoing battle that may never end. For a moment now, let&rsquo;s put aside our differences and, for once, agree on all that is good in the world. Here are five reasons to love your iPhone.</p>
<h2>1) iPhone Is Ridiculously Easy to Use</h2>
<p>While the operating system hasn&rsquo;t changed all that much over the years, it&rsquo;s still, and always has been, super easy to use. As the old saying goes, if it ain&rsquo;t broke, why fix it?</p>
<p>Many Apple fans find that the simple design and user-friendly OS is one of the main reasons that they love their phone. Just unlock the screen and start using it. Everything is super intuitive, which means that you shouldn&rsquo;t have any problems.</p>
<h2>2) iPhone Cameras Are Top Notch</h2>

<p>Over the years, iPhone cameras have got progressively better and are now some of the highest quality smartphone cameras in the world. What&rsquo;s more, with the release of iPhone X, the shooter has been taken to an entirely new level. The &lsquo;true depth camera&rsquo; gives you one of the best and most authentic pictures that you can ever imagine. What could be better than that?</p>
<h2>3) iPhone Gets the Latest and Greatest Apps</h2>
<p>When you choose an iPhone, you may worry about what apps are available. Well, fear not! The truth of the matter is that most mainstream apps come out on iOS at the same time (or even before) they do on Android devices. That should mean that you have your pick of the best and latest apps.</p>
<h2>4) Apple Pay Is So Convenient</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You&rsquo;ve run out to the supermarket in a hurry to grab one more thing for dinner, but when you get to the checkout, you realise you left your purse or wallet on the table at home. Nightmare. Luckily, if you happen to have an iPhone, you don&rsquo;t need to worry all that much. Just whip out your device, double tap the home button, and pay with Apple Pay. Phew.</p>
<h2>5) iPhone is Always Super Smooth</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here &ndash; iPhone devices are super-fast. It&rsquo;s just that simple. The new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Plus</a>, and X all boast a snazzy Apple-designed A11 Bionic chip. That&rsquo;s just as high-tech and awesome as it sounds. The chip means that whether you&rsquo;re playing a new game or using VR or AR, you can be sure that your phone will perform like a champ, running super smooth and fast. Nice.</p>
