<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year once again. Yes, the Grand National 2018 starts today, running through to Sunday 14th April. The question is: will <em>your </em>horse come in this time around?</p>
<p>Long gone are the days when you had to haul yourself to a bookie to place a bet. Oh no, times have changed! Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned partaker in the annual tradition, or completely new to the game, using a decent betting app is the only way to go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of the best betting apps for Android and iPhone, and why you should try them.</p>
<h2>Bet365</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17173" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fsItW_Y93_z86x4iOefvLtW_CDhkBOfzDQTiTdvfJMioH07lfCw8gQR6yOl89Q0tzYZj33FnsO_MHCpB_oa0u3QL=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>With more than 23 million users, Bet365 is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading betting apps. Of course, that means that it has pretty sweet deals when it comes to the big race. Previously, this particular site has offered a Grand National free bet for new users, which is worth looking out for this year.</p>
<p><em>Although watch out for any hidden terms and conditions on that!</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the Non-Runner No-Bet feature, which means that if the horse you choose doesn&rsquo;t end up running, you can get a refund. That&rsquo;s important. The last thing you want to do is waste your bet on a horse that doesn&rsquo;t even get to start, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bet365/id519684662?mt=8">>> Download Bet365 for free on iPhone</a></p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.bet365.com/">>> Visit Bet365 mobile site on Android</a></p>
<h2>Coral</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17174" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ysbS0WtdTSIc9eupImZve_pw74YmulEx5owOE1IDpifQZOYoatHQdJBS7KNxjKQvF_vggs2Z9RKH_i7jZ5mQFf05xg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Aside from offering tips and preview information, the Coral app is very easy to use. When you place your first bet of &pound;5 (or more) on it, you will get &pound;20 worth of free bets (again, check the terms before you sign up!). It may just be worth using that freebie for your Grand National bet, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to back more than one horse.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the race, you should take a moment to check out <a href="http://news.coral.co.uk/blog">Coral&rsquo;s blog</a>. The site posts a lot about the horses and what you can expect to see on the big day. Who knows? You might just find a tip that helps you win big!</p>
<p>>> Download Coral free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id553287152?mt=8">iPhone</a> | Android</p>
<h2>William Hill</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17175" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yxAENcRnvWHgmVKQPCUpsRchhD49zoKsrAXGJVgbU7xFX3MgW8HhH6IJerfOQj4n-KIqyeBbrxWe-kV_Ko51SYVH=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>You may have heard the name before now, but how much do you know about this betting site and app? Well, if you&rsquo;re a new customer, it could be worth signing up to the William Hill app. To bag yourself &pound;30 worth of free bets, all you need to do is make an initial &pound;10.</p>
<p>Of course, you could use that money on your Grand National bets or, indeed, anything else you fancy your odds on. The betting site will be offering odds on all 21 of the races, which means that you have a chance to really go wild when it comes to your bets.</p>
<p>>> Download William Hill free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/william-hill-sports-betting/id465712788?mt=8">iPhone</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.williamhill.sports.android&amp;gl=gb&amp;hl=en">Android</a></p>
