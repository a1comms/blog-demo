<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">What were you thinking, guys?</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long, long way together. Through the hard times and the good. But now, let&rsquo;s celebrate the oddballs of smartphone history. Let&rsquo;s celebrate them like we should. Here's our top 10 weirdest mobile phones of all time.</p>
<h2>1) Nokia 3650</h2>
<p>If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it. That&rsquo;s a motto that Nokia should have stuck to back in the early 2000s. While the world was totally fine with rectangular keyboards, they decided to mix it up a little. The weird and not-so-wonderful Nokia 3650 was born&hellip; complete with the round keyboard of our nightmares. Thanks, guys.</p>

<p>Is it an MP3 player? Is it a battery pack? No, it&rsquo;s the Nokia 7280! This seriously strange phone was ahead of its time, packing an FM radio (those were the days!), Bluetooth, and a speakerphone feature. Oh, how far we&rsquo;ve come.</p>

<h2>3) Motorola FlipOut</h2>
<p>What a name! The Motorola FlipOut was just as wild as it sounds. It was basically a Rubix Cube masquerading as a phone. To use the qwerty keyboard, you needed to&hellip; flip-it-out. Hours of fun. Okay, maybe not... Seconds of fun?</p>

<h2>4) Samsung Serene</h2>
<p>Back in 2005, Samsung clearly had some pretty odd ideas about the way the mobile phone industry was going. That&rsquo;s when it brought out the Samsung Serene. The flip phone came complete with a round keyboard and full colour screen&hellip;. Interesting. Sadly, this one&rsquo;s been discontinued.</p>

<h2>5) Motorola V70</h2>
<p>Pfft&hellip; Forget flip phones&hellip; Motorola knew what the people wanted. They wanted a phone that they could slide all the way around to open. Pair that with a small round screen and you&rsquo;re onto a winning combo. Say hello to the Motorola V70 &ndash; the device the world forgot.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17316" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Klk-z-PCmy_fNHXtfXDnBqMHQz_Euy-mmJrxi5CKpsrd5O1OGq6aCR_lTN15UoRXLr3bucTf4qlNa3QSjGA9od-8=s0" alt="" />6) Nokia 7600</h2>
<p>If a Tamagotchi and Nokia 3310 had a baby&hellip; It might look a little something like this. With buttons around the screen (why?!) and quite possibly the oddest shape for a phone known to man, the Nokia 7600 is something that&rsquo;s truly out of this world.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17309" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wXM9hbJ81-2cJwfBpRFE2a-xV-1Vtb-0DlZHETvoVJzBmd90YDuif8fD1pKZU8gYaCjcRvUL9F95hQdzwkTNrzZt0w=s0" alt="" /></h2>

<h2>7) Project Ara</h2>
<p>If the idea of building your own smartphone sounds like a dream-come-true, this would have been the phone for you. Project Ara was just that &ndash;&nbsp;a project. Google set about making a 'modular smartphone', which allowed people to pick and choose elements of their device. We&rsquo;ll admit that it&rsquo;s a pretty cool idea... but a seriously weird one too.</p>

<h2>8) BlackBerry Passport</h2>
<p>Four years ago, BlackBerry decided to challenge the status quo. They took a leap of faith and created the Passport. The touch keyboard and solid square design was enough to set this quirky phone apart from the crowd. Here&rsquo;s to being shamelessly different!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17313" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yHCfdrVVwWH8VOUFCs4VKIwkeUzqWwx8R_6USt5Vy4qYRsotOT3rqf7zAA33urVYStqjrg50xbvo9ZY7DPOSrAeU=s0" alt="" /></p>

<h2>9) Nokia N-Gage</h2>
<p>Half phone, half handheld games console, the Nokia N-Gage was every teenager&rsquo;s dream back in the early 2000s. Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here &ndash; it looked awesome. Sadly, the device just didn&rsquo;t live up to its gaming promises&hellip; Nice try, Nokia.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17312" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CFnuYodbe-NtxPozO4l-fBQHCKAC_k6o55xVIopk2z-t_DqvZ6wYlK7ejCBycxJesaLbvdqOBrMGYJHAC8DN3Vhi=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>10) Samsung Serenata</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Put the screen below the keyboard&hellip; No, no&hellip; BELOW it&hellip;. Yeah, and while you&rsquo;re at it, make the keyboard a round navigation dial with a button in the middle&hellip; Don&rsquo;t question it! Just do it, yeah?&rdquo; We can only imagine the wild ramblings that took place at Samsung HQ when the Serenata was created.</p>
