<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is this the most retro iPhone out right now?</span></p>
<p>From Face ID and VR features to the ability to order a car at the touch of a button, the modern-day smartphone is a thing of wonder. In all the excitement, though, we&rsquo;ve probably forgotten something.</p>
<p>A mere nine years ago, the world of tech was a whole different ball game. Yes, back in 2009, mobile phones had nothing on the crazy high-tech smartphones of today.</p>
<p>Luckily, the good people of South Korea will soon take a walk down memory lane and get the chance to relive those eras past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because SK Telink will be putting the classic (because that&rsquo;s what it is now!) iPhone 3GS on sale after discovering an old batch that never got shipped, according to online publication, <a href="http://www.etnews.com/20180613000027?mc=em_004_00001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ET News</a>.</p>
<p>The third-generation phone was the first to adopt 3G data connectivity &ndash; its predecessors had 2G. The design is similar to the original iPhone, but it has a few small upgrades. Highlights from the device include the fact that you can use video recording features and an enhanced voice system. So far, so good. However, put this thing next to a modern offering and you&rsquo;ll see some rather <em>major </em>differences.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17764" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vlwKmaA36kUN-FqSOG4yWVs66HN3RcVaZW8YQUtNjkjUcwzXxOyp2uEjmOBoGA0rwHDYR6Ft60AKI2ISPhej8DI=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>For example, iPhone 3GS doesn&rsquo;t have a front-facing camera at all, which means that selfies are extremely hard to perfect. Holding the phone up backward and trying to capture your face blindly is a truly difficult feat.</p>
<p>As though that&rsquo;s not troubling enough, the phone runs an old chipset, which means that a lot of our favourite apps just won&rsquo;t work. So, with these issues in mind, why should people bother buying it at all?</p>
<p>Well, while the phone is never going to replace the latest flagship, there&rsquo;s a certain sense of nostalgia that comes alongside owning one of these beauties. Sure, it can&rsquo;t do all the things that the iPhone X can, but it does remind us of a simpler time.</p>

<p>A time when phones were little more than... Well, phones! People may not buy iPhone 3GS as their main device, but the retailer believes that they will flock for a tiny piece of tech history.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s hardly going to cost an arm and a leg! The retro phone will soon go on sale for 44,000 won (just under &pound;30). It&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the satisfaction of being the most &lsquo;hipster&rsquo; hipster in the room.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re using the iPhone X?&rdquo; *Wrinkles nose* &ldquo;I like to keep things real with the 3GS&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
