<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple is taking measures to fix any iPhone X problems.</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than technology failing you.</p>
<p>Yes, if your iPhone X screen is not working properly, you might find yourself frustrated, angry, and even a little... sad.</p>
<p>Never fear! The powers at Apple have heard your cries and they want to help you out by giving you a <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone-x-display-module-replacement-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free screen replacement</a>. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know and how to get yours.</p>
<h2>Do You Have a Faulty iPhone X Screen? Read This!</h2>
<p>Got an iPhone X with a faulty screen? Here&rsquo;s the best news you&rsquo;ll hear all day.</p>
<p>Apple has launched a program that could entitle you to a brand-new screen replacement. If you&rsquo;ve encountered any of the following issues and think that you have a faulty iPhone X screen, you may be entitled to a replacement for free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touchscreen being unresponsive</li>
<li>Working without being touched</li>
<li>Responding intermittently</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the above sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re screaming yes, you can take your iPhone X directly to the Apple store for the geniuses to test it. Phew!</p>
<p>(Of course, you might want to book an appointment at the Genius Bar ahead of time!)</p>
<p>If they find that you do indeed have a faulty iPhone X screen, the team will replace it with a new &lsquo;display module&rsquo; for the sweet, sweet price of nothing! Score.</p>
<h2>Apple&rsquo;s Screen Replacements Only Apply to iPhone X</h2>
<p>But before you rush off to book yourself an appointment at your nearest Apple store, there&rsquo;s something that you should know.</p>
<p>This screen replacement program only applies to iPhone X models. That means that if you have an older phone or, indeed, an iPhone XS, XS Max, or XR, you will not be able to get a free screen replacement. But then again, you won&rsquo;t need one!</p>
<h2>Warning: Damaged Screens Are Not Eligible</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s another condition that you need to know about. I&rsquo;m looking at you, Mr or Mrs Butterfingers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve dropped your iPhone X a few too many times and the screen has external damage, the chances are that your device will not be eligible for a full screen replacement.</p>
<p>While it would be nice to nab a free screen to replace your cracked one, this program is specifically for displays that have touchscreen issues.</p>
