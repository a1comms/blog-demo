<p>Do you protect yourself online? It&rsquo;s quite a simple question and yet you may not know how to answer it.</p>
<p>These days, data security is more important than ever before. Your whole life is stored on the likes of your phone and laptop.</p>
<p>So, how can you make sure your data and private information is safe? Take a look at these five security apps and try them for yourself.</p>
<h2>1) Secure Messaging</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17185" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h2hhO5dB5239w_X_4CfME8vOqRdfLL-LSytuInW1f8BFQ1vwjBwHrGZAcKca-ghDQ37gbY3tzcvPrQ-f_K8SBtk6aw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Worried about the security of your communications? Signal could be the answer!</p>
<p>The Signal app offers end-to-end encrypted messages and calls which means that everything you say or send as a message will be 100% private.</p>
<p>You can create groups and chat with a whole bunch of people at the same time too. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, it verifies the identity of the person that you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>Download Signal for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">iPhone</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;hl=en_GB">Android</a></p>
<h2>2) Secure Video Calls</h2>

<p>Wire is quite similar to Signal in that it offers encrypted messages, but it goes a little deeper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different to many security apps of its type in that it offers group video calling. For that reason, many people tend to use it for their business communications and conference calling.</p>
<p>The Wire app feels extremely secure in that it sends a unique login passcode to each user every single time they log into it.</p>
<p>Download Wire for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wire-private-messenger/id930944768?mt=8">iPhone</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire">Android</a></p>
<h2>3) Secure Passwords</h2>

<p>Password security is a huge deal these days. Getting an app to secure and manage all your passwords is certainly the way to go.</p>
<p>One of the best security apps in this area is 1Password, which uses AES 256-bit encryption to keep things safe. Not only does this mean that you don&rsquo;t need to remember all your different passwords but it also means that you will have that extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Download 1Password for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8">iPhone</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword&amp;hl=en_GB">Android</a></p>

<h2>4) Private Browsing</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17184" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5jcpfPkMfUWNUTl-R_tGfKA4idm0KbTLBk9Q2jJGywDlCu_LWY2ylnXK5BdZ1TXV31iT4LWlNc5EGNfyAcc3zCVV=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sick of cookies logging your browsing activity? Onion browser could be the answer you&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>
<p>The iOS browser app is easy-to-use and means that you can securely browse the web using either your iPhone or iPad. Phew.</p>
<p>Of course, the Onion browsing app does <em>not </em>store cookies, and blocks scripts. That means that you can use the internet freely without having to worry about your privacy or security settings. What could be better?</p>
<p>Download Onion Browser for free on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8">iPhone</a></p>
<h2>5) Secure &amp; Private Browsing</h2>

<p>If you need an extra level of security when it comes to your online browsing, you could always download NordVNP.</p>
<p>This security app comes from the team behind the virtual private network and is easy to download and start using right away. When you have this particular app, it means that your connection is private. It reroutes and encrypts web traffic, which should mean your browsing is super secure.</p>
