<p><span class="postStandFirst">As many have said, the tale of the Flappy Bird app is a strange one, but the tale is not over yet: after being pulled from sale, it turns out that Flappy Bird will be reappearing in app stores.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/12454697094_a46f037903.jpg" width="500" height="285" /></p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a catch: according to developer Dong Nguyen&rsquo;s&nbsp;Twitter feed, Flappy Bird&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;coming back, but, in his words, &ldquo;not soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Still, many people have wished for the return of&nbsp;Flappy Bird, so they will be very happy when it returns to the App Store (for the likes of the iPhone 5c) and Google Play (for Android phones like the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, it still remains a strange tale, as many people are wondering why the game was pulled in the first place; Dong Nguyen&rsquo;s has said it was because people were finding the game to be addictive, which seems unusual for a game developer to say.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/13305151205_99eac42b0c.jpg" width="500" height="260" /></p>
<p>Thus, many people believed it was a marketing stunt, but with this latest news, that possibility has perhaps got a little slimmer; if he was doing it as a marketing stunt, then he would have had already planned to re-release it before now, thus capitalising on the buzz before it died down, and before people moved on to other things.</p>
<p>The fact that he hasn&rsquo;t done that does strongly imply that his motives for pulling it off sale were genuine, which does him immense credit.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no official word on&nbsp;Flappy Bird&nbsp;will become available again, so if you want to catch up on a trend that rocked the mobile world, stay tuned for more updates as and when they happen.</strong></p>
