<h5>Personality Type: The Perfectionist</h5>
<p>You like things to be neat, tidy, and always organised. In your ideal world, everything would be pure perfection. You&rsquo;re always on time. You know what you have scheduled in your diary for weeks in advance. In your friendship group, the chances are that you&rsquo;re the reliable one.</p>

<h5>Personality Type: The Elegant One</h5>
<p>Black is the colour of elegance and power. These are two traits that you own, in a serious way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most likely to win best dressed at every event and you know how to put a killer outfit together on the fly. But that&rsquo;s not all. You&rsquo;re also a force to be reckoned with. When you want something, you know how to get it&hellip; and nothing stops you.</p>

<h5>Personality Type: The Smart One</h5>
<p>Smart, stable, and sometimes a little sassy &ndash; that&rsquo;s how most people would describe you. You&rsquo;ve got it all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the type of person who always has the answer, however difficult the question may be. Still, you like to think outside the box, which is why steer clear of the standard black and white tones in favour of something a tad cooler. Hello, blue iPhone XR!</p>

<h5>Personality Type: The Quirky One</h5>
<p>You love to follow your own path. You&rsquo;re less of a trend-follower, than you are a trend-setter.</p>
<p>Your friends know you as the person who always brings energy and happiness to the party. You&rsquo;re a bright and cheerful person who always knows their own mind. And, in your mind, you know that you want a yellow iPhone XR. Nice!</p>

<h5>Personality Type: The Fashionista</h5>

<p>The colour red shows your power and leadership skills. They are at your core.</p>
