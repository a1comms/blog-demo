<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the upcoming, though rather elusive phablet in the iconic Note series. Can we expect Samsung to do the business yet again?</span></p>
<p>Phablets have become a big deal, ever since Samsung first introduced the world to the concept with the launch of the original Galaxy Note. Since then, they've&nbsp;gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p>The <em>next </em>version of the Korean manufacturer&rsquo;s top-end phablet, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, is due to be unveiled very soon, which means it&rsquo;s time to review the rumours, and see if we can construct some sort of idea of what to expect&hellip;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Design</span></h2>
<p>It seems reasonable to assume that Samsung Galaxy Note 5 will share the same design ethos as its predecessor, Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>However, what may well change is the list of materials used in the phone&rsquo;s construction; Samsung Galaxy S6 makes extensive use of glass and metal in its design, and rumours point to Galaxy Note 5 going down the same route.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also rumoured to be longer and wider than its predecessor, for a very good reason...</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Screen</span></h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is said to sport a gargantuan 5.9-inch screen, which of course outsizes the 5.7-incher on Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>This would explain the speculation that it&rsquo;s likely to arrive longer and wider; simply to accommodate the bumped up screen space.</p>
<p>In terms of resolution, we might witness something light years beyond anything on the market, as Galaxy Note 5 is said to boast a 4K Ultra HD screen, dripping with 3840x2160 pixels.</p>
<p>If true, that means that Galaxy Note 5&rsquo;s display will feature almost as many pixels along its short edge as it predecessor has along the <em>long</em> edge!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Camera</span></h2>
<p>If the whispers are true, Samsung Galaxy Note 5 could be in store for a serious upgrade in the camera department, although it&rsquo;s not certain how big an upgrade it will be, just yet.</p>
<p>Some rumours have suggested that it&rsquo;ll wield an 18-megapixel camera, while others have stated that the resolution will be going up to 21-megapixels. The front camera, meanwhile, is said to come in at either 5 or 6-megapixels.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Power</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to the power under the bonnet, the rumours are once again inconsistent. Some are claiming it&rsquo;ll use an Exynos 7420 processor, and others stating it will use Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 810.</p>
<p>However, both of those are octa-core processors, so whichever one Samsung selects, Galaxy Note 5 will be rapid, and further enhanced by a rumoured 3GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Despite speculation that that it will be available with 128GB of on-board storage, Galaxy Note 5 is <em>also</em> said to have a microSD slot!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Release Date</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/unpacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Unpacked</a> is set for 13<sup>th</sup> August, so in all likelihood that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll see Samsung Galaxy Note 5 unveiled.</p>
<p>Samsung is allegedly aiming to get the Note 5 into customers&rsquo; hands before the launch of Apple&rsquo;s highly anticipated iPhone 6S / iPhone 7, so expect availability towards the end of August.</p>
<p><strong>If true, we don&rsquo;t have long to wait, until we find out precisely how unreal Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is. Mark the date in your diary, because you can be it&rsquo;s going to be <em>noteworthy</em>. </strong></p>
