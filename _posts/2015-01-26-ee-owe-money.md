<p><span class="postStandFirst"><a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/ee">EE</a> has announced that it will be refunding a total of &pound;1 million to a number of customers, after incorrect billing charges caused those customers to be charged too much VAT on international data roaming. If you are affected by this, read on to find out how to claim your refund...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6051" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/cKYnP1ZDizeo6ShHF6u5Tx82jRtuo7zjn1B_vxIZU30RmLoRxEaAzzVhuauJZP1PuAw300.png" alt="EE" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Do you use a phone on EE, or have you <em>recently</em> used an EE phone, between October 2012 and October 2014? Have you used data roaming outside of the European Union? If so, you might be interested to hear today&rsquo;s news, as there&rsquo;s a very real chance EE is going to be giving you some money back.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30881779">BBC News</a>, a number (around 0.5%) of EE customers are due to be getting part of a &pound;1 million refund after being wrongly charged VAT.</p>
<p>The refund comes after an error was made in EE&rsquo;s systems, and was highlighted after a customer complained about errors on their bill. According to spokesman David Nieberg, &ldquo;Due to a configuration error in our billing system, made following a system change, a small number of customers were wrongly charged VAT on the Data Roaming bundle outside of Europe. We've claimed that money back from HMRC, and then it goes back to the customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The value expected to be refunded varies from &pound;2 to &pound;80 per customer, and EE will be contacting those customers by text message, to inform them of the amount they will be getting. If you are affected, this refund will be in the form of credit on your account; EE has said that it will not be offering it as a cash refund.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a former customer, and you think you might be eligible for the refund, then <a href="http://ee.co.uk/help/get-in-touch">contact EE&rsquo;s customer services</a>, and the network will look into it.</p>
