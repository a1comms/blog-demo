<p><span class="postStandFirst">All the big rumours from the world of smartphones...</span></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Mega</h2>
<p>Samsung is planning to produce a new phablet with a monstrous 6.3 inch HD display. Powering the Samsung Galaxy Mega is a rumoured 1.7GHz dual-core processor with 1.5GB RAM backing it up. The Galaxy Mega is said to also be sporting an 8 megapixel camera, NFC and LTE support for 4G access.</p>
<h2>New iPhone</h2>
<p>Rumours have been rife about the next iPhone, or should we say iPhones as word-on-the-street is that Apple is planning on launching not one but possibly two new handsets this year. The first naturally being a replacement to the iPhone 5 and dubbed the iPhone 5S, or possibly the iPhone 6, this handset is expected to have a bigger, higher res screen, a faster processor and a larger camera sensor, with numbers pointing&nbsp; to a 13 megapixel unit. The second device is said to be a more budget-orientated, perhaps based on the specs of the&nbsp;iPhone 4S. A common suggestion is that the budget unit could ship in various colours, much like the latest generation iPod.</p>
<h2>Nexus 7.2</h2>
<p>As Google's I/0 Developer event approaches rumours are hotting up around the latest incarnation of Google's 7 inch slate. Believed to house a Snapdragon 600 quad-core chipset in favour of the Tegra 4, due to power consumption issues, the device will also boast a Full-HD display, a slimmer form factor and of course Android 5.0 Key Lime Pie, which should bring vast improvements and new features to the Android platform.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for more on these smartphones.</strong></p>
