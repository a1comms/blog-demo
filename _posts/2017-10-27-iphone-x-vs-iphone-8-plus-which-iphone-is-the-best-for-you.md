<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Comfortable and familiar, or new and radical?</span></p>
<p>This year, Apple fans are in for a real treat. The mega brand has released more than we could have bargained for &mdash; <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/breaking-iphone-8-8-plus-and-iphone-x-are-finally-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three brand new iPhone</a>. There&rsquo;s so much choice that you may not even know where to begin. Luckily, that&rsquo;s where we come in!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to choose between the all-new iPhone X, or the familiar-looking <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Let&rsquo;s take an in-depth look at what each device brings to the table, shall we?</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest difference between these two phones is the design. iPhone 8 Plus looks much like the rest of the Plus models we&rsquo;ve seen before. It&rsquo;s a solid offering and seems like the most natural progression. Apple fans are likely to feel at ease and comfortable with this familiar device. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that, unlike <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, it does have an all-glass casing.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0DN-BZrM4o" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The design of iPhone X should really blow people away. The almost bezeless display is futuristic, as is the lack of home button. It&rsquo;s clear to see where Apple thinks the world of smartphones is headed. There&rsquo;s just a tiny lip at the top of the device, where the camera and sensors sit neatly. It&rsquo;s a dramatic departure from what we&rsquo;ve known before.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bs_AQejjL-g1UzUTaHa8pVnh_JlfDkGp969l2FVyfaflS2O3x0bmHi2-QsJuz347Wb5GS7pe_5Kc5IhxnkNdtUTr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Both iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus come in a small number of colours &mdash; fewer than we&rsquo;ve previously seen. iPhone X comes in Silver and Space Grey, whereas the 8 Plus comes in Silver, Space Grey, and a new Gold tone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15017" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WXgGEEAN-eFh5OMt52JDFcQLqOZ6RnIl20RB3LlwMhC6XbdvXNqeFOD5CXSji-tMFvwwLNeoPjjMLMYPPEeu97GXWQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>iPhone X&rsquo;s screen was Apple&rsquo;s best kept secret until the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/breaking-iphone-8-8-plus-and-iphone-x-are-finally-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official announcement</a>. The 5.8-inch Super Retina OLED packs a whopping 2436 x 1125 resolution. It is, in fact, Apple&rsquo;s most detailed iPhone display to date, which means that you can expect great things from the picture quality and colour reproduction. This is <em>the</em> iPhone for binging on TV shows and YouTube videos.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14933" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RfiV3K7Qd9y8k8wcW7Z8ODAvabQ5nFBAAfLXS_zqYdPRNEgR_YTRG0rZIfeO9zfdyuELOczxLXUUxPfN8PvWSwzn=s0" alt="" width="600" height="311" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, iPhone 8 Plus has a smaller screen with a lower resolution. The 5.5-inch Retina HD IPS LCD screen is only a slight improvement on what we saw on iPhone 7 Plus. What&rsquo;s more, the resolution comes in just 1920 x 1080. It&rsquo;s a significant difference, sure, but that&rsquo;s compared to iPhone X. In isolation, iPhone 8 Plus&rsquo;s display is very good, and will be more than enough for most.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14946" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1jz1SOKYyM3PYyrmGv1sLmFTEz4GaOm9pLD-BBd0dWIe6PyefSk92fv0lqOzBX4jQX0o4fujZAaEGlYKCgrwcvZf=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>This really comes down to one thing and one thing alone: Would you rather have Touch ID or Face ID? The former is what we&rsquo;ve seen before from Apple, and is what you get when you choose an iPhone 8 Plus. Whereas the latter is exclusive to iPhone X.</p>
<p>Face ID seeks to make phones all but unhackable. The idea is that iPhone X remembers <em>your</em> face, and will only allow <em>you</em> to unlock it (although Apple says there&rsquo;s a 1 in 1,000,000 chance it can be unlocked by someone else, compared to 1 in 500,000 using Touch ID). Simply look at iPhone X to unlock it; this is high-tech security to say the least.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14936" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_UBvRRgO6WLkTyUxDjr5CbdqUDpRgJgJpbMD_RZeSrurZRgZh4_E0_nN3ViFZGiAvNau7tDJ-yTGkiUgY8c6Dj4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you opt for iPhone 8 Plus, you&rsquo;ll get the familiar Touch ID setup we all know and love. Simply register the fingerprint(s) you want to use to unlock your iPhone, and it will unlock as you hold your finger to the Home button. Easy, but not as cool as Face ID &mdash; not by a long shot.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>So, what about the camera? Well, the rear cameras are strikingly similar between iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus. In fact, both have a wide-angle 12MP snapper and a 12MP telephoto snapper on the back. That means that you&rsquo;re certain to get stunning imagery regardless of which device you happen to choose.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mW6hFttt_KE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to the front-facing lens, though, there&rsquo;s a gulf of difference between these phones. iPhone 8 Plus comes with a very respectable 7MP selfie camera, but is hardly comparable to that of iPhone X. That&rsquo;s because, with the X, Apple has added in the True Depth camera; the very thing that makes Face ID possible.</p>
<h2>Best Features</h2>
<p>Wireless charging are the words on everyone&rsquo;s lips right now, and with good reason. Apple has equipped all its latest iPhone models with this rather snazzy feature. That means we can all bid farewell to plugging our phones in, technology of the past, and a hello to placing them on futuristic charging pads. Nice.</p>

<p>Both iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X run <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS 11</a>, so you&rsquo;ll be treated to a brand-new Control Center design, peer-to-peer Apple Pay features, and other updated areas of the system. iOS 11 is now available for most iPhone - <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find out how to download it here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of features that are exclusive to iPhone X. First up, there&rsquo;s Face ID, which we&rsquo;ve already covered above. Then there&rsquo;s the animoji feature that allows users to create their own emoji (or animated emoji) using facial expressions and movements. All gimmicks aside, it's a lot of fun.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14937" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5X2dGdYx_uQKpjtyjnDH5VbbKw4mUL19lwEgRqxdyc2mt5fC7epgB_cVkRxBdOPR0CAeU3UjwSUsoSC4HxpJSkrV=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no beating around the bush here &mdash;&nbsp;iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X are two amazing, but <em>different</em> phones. Which should make this decision easier. It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the major characteristics setting them apart here are the display, design, and, of course, Face ID.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">>> Buy iPhone 8 Plus</a></p>
<p>In terms of price, there&rsquo;s a notable difference. iPhone 8 Plus comes in at &pound;799, which is around the cost of most flagship phones these days. iPhone X costs more at &pound;999. So, your choice here might come down to paying that bit extra for a state-of-the-art model, or whether you&rsquo;re perfectly happy with the &lsquo;standard&rsquo; upgrade instead.</p>
