<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple is working hard to fix a bug in the iMessages app on iPhone, one which allows a malicious text to shut down and reboot your phone. Whilst we wait for the permanent solution, there are a couple of temporary fixes you can use.</span></p>
<p>You may have heard over the past few days, that a bug has been found in iMessages, causing the app to lock up and the phone to shut down. It&rsquo;s proving to be a fairly large annoyance to iPhone users, but fortunately, there is a way to prevent it happening to you.</p>
<p>The message in question is half in English, half in Arabic, and apparently will only shut down the phone if you receive the message while you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> in the iMessages app.</p>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s due to the notification that pops up, or more specifically, due to the Unicode characters <em>in</em> that notification, and Apple has confirmed that it is working on a permanent fix for the problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, until that fix is ready, there are actually two temporary hacks you can use, the first of which&nbsp;allows you to use iMessages again if a rogue text does hit you, and the second stops&nbsp;your phone being&nbsp;rebooted when receiving the text.</p>
<p>So, first of all, use&nbsp;Siri to read your unread messages, and&nbsp;reply to the malicious one&nbsp;with anything you&nbsp;like. Once done, delete the entire message thread, and you&rsquo;ll be able to use iMessages again, as normal.</p>
<p>However, that fix doesn&rsquo;t stop you from getting hit by the same attack later on. To prevent that, you need the second fix: turn off notifications for your messages by heading to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Notifications</strong> > <strong>Messages</strong> > slide <strong>show on local screen</strong> off, and under <strong>alert style when unlocked </strong>select <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p>Apple will no doubt be releasing a software update, imminently,&nbsp;to squash the bug. For good.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve decided against publishing the message that causes the crash.</strong></p>
