<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It's important all iPhone users ensure their software is fully up to date.</span></p>
<p>Apple is advising that all iPhone users update to the latest version of iOS, as an emergency precaution to avoid a potential security risk.</p>
<p>The American tech company has just released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5, in order to combat surveillance malware from infiltrating iPhones via three potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>According to a report from The New York Times, Apple recently received a tip that an Israeli outfit, by the name of NSO Group, is behind the attempted exploits.</p>
<p>The Times states that this company manufactures software that targets mobile phones, exposing texts, emails, calls and contacts, and is even capable of tapping into microphones, harvesting passwords and tracing a device location.</p>
<p>This ghostlike malware is typically sold to authorised government agencies, presumably for lawful public surveillance, and is notoriously difficult to detect. Fortunately, Apple was made aware of such a threat after two researches identified it.</p>
<p>Apple has released a statement that reads, &ldquo;We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>How to update your iPhone software</h2>
<p>To update your iPhone to iOS 9.3.5, go to <strong>Settings > General > Software Update</strong>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be met with a prompt to download the iOS update, like the image below.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Download and Install</strong>; your iPhone should finish updating after approximately five minutes, leaving your iPhone more secure, and your mind reassured.</p>
