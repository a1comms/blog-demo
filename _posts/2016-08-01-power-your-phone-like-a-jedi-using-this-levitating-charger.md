<p><span class="caption postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Strong the force is. Levitate your phone, this charger does.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that we love technology. How could you not, with the rise of things like <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/the-vr-headset-buyers-guide" target="_blank">VR headsets</a> and the upcoming release of <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/samsung-gear-iconx-the-coolest-fitness-tracker-of-all-time" target="_blank">Samsung Gear IconX</a> (the coolest fitness tracker of all time).</p>
<p>But, let&rsquo;s face it, neither seem nearly as impressive as OvRcharge - the levitating charger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/019/287/8c925eba075429c7e450fe711189d650_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1468215666&amp;q=92&amp;s=b62289fb8f2807f82912c3e96f129532" width="680" height="383" /></p>
<p>Wielding the power of The Force, or perhaps using <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em> like an absolute boss, the contraption you see rotating above is in fact a wireless mobile phone charger that, we kid you not, literally levitates your device as it&rsquo;s powering up.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen anything you want more?</p>
<p>AR Designs, the clever people behind OvRcharge, are currently showcasing it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/261307172/ovrcharge-levitating-wireless-charger" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and are almost three quarters of the way to their $40,000 target, with 16 days to go. That&rsquo;s no surprise considering how rad it is.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, though, it turns our OvRcharge doesn&rsquo;t run on Jedi powers. It&rsquo;s actually comprised of a wooden charging base, and a phone case that features an induction receiver (to charge) and a magnet (to float).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/261307172/ovrcharge-levitating-wireless-charger/widget/video.html" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"> </iframe></p>
<p>Basically, OvRcharge is the combination of induction charging and magnetic levitation. And it makes every other wireless charger look like about as innovative as the spork.</p>
<p>Sure, the phone case could probably do with some aesthetic work, especially if you&rsquo;re using it day-to-day when your mobile&rsquo;s not on charge, and some more design options for the charging block might be nice. But do you really care? It&nbsp;frickin levitates your phone.</p>
<p>Apparently OvRcharge is compatible with &lsquo;most phones&rsquo; (and tablets) &ndash; even if your device doesn&rsquo;t feature wireless charging, thanks to the induction receiver built into the case.</p>
<p>The only pitfall, if you want one today, it&rsquo;s going to cost you a cool $209, which by current rates works out to be roughly &pound;160. A&nbsp;disturbance&nbsp;in my bank balance, I sense.</p>
