<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Are you as pretty as a picture?</span></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered whether you look like a piece of art? Well, no, neither have I. It&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s crossed most of our minds. But, now, Google has decided to answer the question that no one was asking: What famous masterpiece do I resemble?</p>
<p>The Google Arts &amp; Culture app (download free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-arts-culture/id1050970557?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>) launched back in 2016, but has recently been treated to a surprising new feature&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a selfie and discover if your portrait is in a museum,&rdquo; reads the cryptic description. The feature is pretty straight forward. Upload the best picture of yourself and then the app matches you with your artwork doppelg&auml;nger.</p>

<p>For example, you may find that you look a little like Mona Lisa, or perhaps the lady portrayed in A Woman Nursing a Child. In theory, the app reads your face shape and features, and then finds a piece of art that shares a similar look.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it takes mere seconds to figure out which picture you happen to look like. If you&rsquo;re hoping to try this out for yourself, it couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Just follow these quick steps:</p>
<p><strong>1) Open the App </strong></p>
<p>In the Arts &amp; Culture app, scroll down to the bottom of the screen. There you should see a thumbnail that reads, &lsquo;Is your portrait in a museum?&rsquo; Click on the &lsquo;Get started&rsquo; button.</p>
<p><strong>2) Take a Selfie </strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to use the built-in camera on the app. Make sure that you get the lighting just right and choose your angle well. Take as many selfies as you need before you get the one that looks the most art-worthy.</p>
<p><strong>3) Check Your Results</strong></p>
<p>Of course, Arts &amp; Culture doesn&rsquo;t give you just one option here. You&rsquo;ll get a swipe-able range of pictures that apparently look like you. That means that you can tailor your results (somewhat!) and choose the most flattering portrait from the list you&rsquo;re given.</p>
<p><strong>4) Share with Your Friends</strong></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve figured out which picture you resemble, don&rsquo;t forget to share it online. After all, did it even happen if you didn&rsquo;t share it? Loads of people have been sharing their results on Twitter and some of the results are quite hilarious.</p>
