<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The wait is finally over, guys! And we&rsquo;re spoiled for choice.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else has put so much power into people&rsquo;s hands than iPhone,&rdquo; uttered Apple&rsquo;s CEO, Tim Cook, while addressing the audience at the Steve Jobs Theater on 12 September.</p>
<p>This was one of many weighty statements he put out there, right before introducing what we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for. Say hello to iPhone 8, 8 Plus and&hellip; iPhone X.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus</h2>
<p>Phil Schiller, the senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, then took to the stage to give us a little more information about what we can expect from the new generation of smartphones. First of all, let&rsquo;s talk about the look of these two new iPhones.</p>
<p>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will come in <strong>silver, space grey, </strong>and a new <strong>gold </strong>finish<strong>. </strong>What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;ll have an aerospace grade 7000 series custom aluminium casing, which, frankly, sounds like something that&rsquo;s completely out of this world. And maybe that&rsquo;s the point.</p>

<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will have the &lsquo;most durable&rsquo; glass that any iPhone has ever had. (With any luck, that means an end to smashing your screen when you accidentally drop the phone!) It will also be microscopically sealed so that no dust or water can get into it. Sounds rather snazzy.</p>
<p>So, now we know the general specs of the two devices, what can we expect in terms of features? Well, Schiller spent a whole lot of time going into the areas in which Apple has seriously upped its game. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Wireless Charging</strong></p>
<p>While iPhone 7 lacked in this area, Apple will finally be bringing wireless charging to the masses. Schiller explained that there&rsquo;ll be a range of charging pads from different manufacturers out there. What&rsquo;s more, in the future, many restaurants and bars around the globe will have these charging systems available for customers too.</p>

<p><strong>Louder Speakers </strong></p>
<p>Audio fans rejoice! The speaker system has also been improved on iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. According to Schiller, the speakers in these newest phones will be a whopping 25% louder than those on iPhone 7.</p>
<p><strong>Brand New Chip</strong></p>
<p>Finally, both iPhone 8 and the Plus will be packed with a new 11 <em>bionic</em> chip which is reportedly the &lsquo;most powerful and smartest chip&rsquo; ever in an iPhone. Nice work, Apple.</p>
<h2>But wait, that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</h2>
<p>Just when fans thought that they&rsquo;d had all they could handle, Schiller had another thing to announce. iPhone 8 and 8 Plus wouldn&rsquo;t be the only two new phones on the market. Oh no! The iPhone X (pronounced &ldquo;iPhone Ten&rdquo; FYI) is on its way too. And, frankly, it looks like a serious gamechanger.</p>

<p>Here are a couple more of the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Facial Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing that you need to know about this device is that it has a true-depth camera and facial recognition. Yes, iPhone X recognises your face when you look at it. This means that you can open your device simply with a smile. You can also authenticate Apple ID using this feature. The future really is here.</p>

<p><strong>Animoji</strong></p>
<p>Animoji uses the aforementioned facial recognition feature to make unique emoji. You just look at your camera, choose a character, make a funny expression, and the phone creates an emoji in seconds. What&rsquo;s more, as the name suggests, you can make animated emoji in the same way. You just need to use the feature, make a video of yourself, and you will see an animated emoji mimicking your every move. Incredible.</p>

<p>So, there you have it - three whole new iPhones to choose from! Well, we hardly know where to start. It&rsquo;s so exciting. Watch this space for more Apple news later this week.</p>
