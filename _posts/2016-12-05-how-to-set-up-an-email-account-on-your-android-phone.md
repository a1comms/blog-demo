<p>Lots of us rely on our smartphones over a computer for our everyday digital habits, like checking in with friends, shopping on the web and working through emails. So it&rsquo;s important to get your mobile correctly set up for everything you need.</p>
<p>When it comes to email on Android phones, the big question is how to set up your accounts for the best and easiest access. The good news is you&rsquo;re in the right place to find out.</p>
<h2>Gmail: The One App to Rule Them All</h2>
<p>Like the Mail app on iPhone, the Gmail app on Android allows you to read and send mail from most email addresses within the app itself. That includes your Yahoo and Hotmail accounts, alongside your Gmail account, of course.</p>
<p>Adding (or removing) your email accounts to the Gmail app is straightforward. Your Android phone should arrive with Gmail already installed; if it doesn&rsquo;t, you can download it from Google Play for free.</p>

<h2>How to Set Up an Email Account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open up the Gmail app on your Android device.</li>
<li>In the top left corner, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Just to the right of your username, tap the <strong>Down</strong> arrow.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>Add Account</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the account type you want to set up.
<ul>
<li>For Office 365, select Exchange.</li>
<li>If your email client is listed, select Other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proceed through on-screen steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>With your email account set up, your emails will be available on your Android smartphone right around the clock. To add multiple email accounts (including non-Gmail ones), just go through the above steps again. With more than one set up, you can switch between them by opening the Gmail app, tapping the <strong>Menu</strong> icon followed by the <strong>Down</strong> arrow, and selecting the account you want to view.</p>
<h2>How to Remove an Email Account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open up the Gmail app on your Android device.</li>
<li>In the top left corner, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Just to the right of your username, tap the <strong>Down</strong> arrow.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>Manage Accounts</strong> ><strong> Personal</strong></li>
<li>Choose the email account you want to remove.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>More</strong> > <strong>Remove Account</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should be all you need to add or remove an email account on your Android mobile. If you&rsquo;re having any trouble, leave us a comment and we&rsquo;ll try our best to help.</p>
