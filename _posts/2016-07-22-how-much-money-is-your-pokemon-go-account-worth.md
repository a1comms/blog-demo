<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the cynics who&rsquo;ve been trolling Pok&eacute;mon GO users this past fortnight, the joke is very much on you.</p>
<p>Players with high-level profiles, or specific rare and powerful Pok&eacute;mon, are selling their accounts for thousands of pounds online.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10963" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/Pokemon-GO-worth-thousands.gif" alt="Pokemon GO worth thousands" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Did you really just read that? Yes, yes you did.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re as idle as Snorlax, or Slowpokes a little late to the party, wannabe Pok&eacute;mon masters are buying up established accounts on auction sites like eBay. One particular account went for <em>tenta</em>-cool &pound;7,300.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_10961" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-10961" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/07/Pokemon-GO-account-sold-for-&pound;7300.png" alt="Pokemon GO account sold for &pound;7300" width="600" height="375" /> They&rsquo;ve mastered Pok&eacute;mon GO, and now they&rsquo;re mastering the art of emptying your bank accounts.[/caption]</p>
<p>As a result, several Pok&eacute;mon GO accounts have started emerging on eBay, despite risks around having both the buyer and seller&rsquo;s account disabled, as outlined in the terms that were, let&rsquo;s face it, far too long and boring to read in full. Here&rsquo;s the part:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Use the Services or Content, or any portion thereof, for any commercial purpose or for the benefit of any third party or in a manner not permitted by these Terms, including but not limited to (a) gathering in App items or resources for sale outside the App, (b) performing services in the App in exchange for payment outside the App, or (c) sell, resell, rent, or lease the App or your Account.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Clearly unfazed (or, more likely, blissfully unaware), one user managed to fetch &pound;1,370 for their Pok&eacute;mon Go account, writing: &ldquo;The game is great and I had so much fun for the past two and half weeks but I&rsquo;m afraid I [have come] to the point where I won&rsquo;t be able to play much because of work and studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have a really strong account to smash the gyms &hellip; and show off to your friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if there&rsquo;s one way to earn street credit with my mates, it doesn&rsquo;t involve trading in my savings for a virtual Bellsprout.</p>

<p>You have to ask, why are Pok&eacute;mon GO accounts fetching such ludicrous sums of money?</p>
<p>On the face of it, phrases like &lsquo;more money than sense&rsquo; seem fitting, but what buyers are getting, is hours and potentially days&rsquo; worth of time invested in walking the streets, for mile upon mile, catching and levelling up Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
<p><strong>Essentially, buyers are getting Pok&eacute;mon GO, without the GO.</strong></p>
