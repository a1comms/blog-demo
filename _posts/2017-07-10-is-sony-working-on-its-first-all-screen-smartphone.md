<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Rumour has it Sony will release an Xperia smartphone that&rsquo;s all screen and no bezels (the frame around the screen).</span></p>
<p>According to information posted by Chinese social media site, Weibo, it looks likely that Sony will be announcing its first ever bezel-free handset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony Xperia range</a> is known for its unique design, shape and distinguished look. That said, if this rumour is true, Sony will be joining the &lsquo;trend of the time&rsquo; launching its first bezel-free phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely the spec of this rumoured handset will boast everything that the Sony Xperia XZ Premium features, but with even more we hope. But this is guess work for now, I mean, where will Sony put the front facing camera?</p>

<p>When will we see this rumoured Sony Xperia, you say? The anticipation is building! It&rsquo;s predicted we&rsquo;ll get the first look at this smartphone towards the end of August 2017, according to Weibo.</p>
<p>And why is Weibo confident of an August announcement? Well in addition to this year&rsquo;s IFA show, the annual event where all the latest tech gets unveiled, <a href="http://www.xperiablog.net/2017/06/29/sony-ifa-2017-press-conference-31-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony has announced its own press conference</a> to be held the day before. Coincidence? We think not.</p>

<h2>Is Bezel-Less Better?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen flagship handsets from manufacturers this year making strides to achieve bezel-less screens, with the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6<u>,</u> as well as handsets from <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei</a> and HTC.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_14209" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-14209 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gq2kr-G1Qjl3o2lB3jJxqL1R2h355LeOPSuDJiDUNurygpup5CJTIMjshYBkGxP-KK7W2DvlMYBqdR31CDqsN6k=s0" width="600" height="300" /> Samsung Galaxy S8[/caption]</p>
<p>So, what are the benefits of a bezel-less screen? Well, for one we can enjoy bigger screens without making our handsets bigger, perfect for viewing movies and other video content.</p>
<p>On the flipside, what do thinner bezels mean for physical buttons? Samsung tackled this recently, removing the row of buttons on the front, and instead integrated the same functionality into its software. As for the fingerprint sensor, Samsung rehomed it on the back of the handset. All in all, you get the same amazing functionality, in a better-looking, more economical design!</p>
<p>Watch this space, there&rsquo;s a new Sony Xperia smartphone coming&hellip; Or is there..?</p>
