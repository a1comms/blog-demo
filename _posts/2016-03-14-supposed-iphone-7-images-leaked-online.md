<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Somebody call a plumber, because Apple&rsquo;s production line might have just leaked photos of the rumoured iPhone 7.</span></p>
<p>New images have been published on the French website <a href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/iphone-7-photos-catcher-112935/">NowhereElse.fr</a>, purporting to reveal the chassis of the yet-to-be-confirmed iPhone 7, along with what appears to be a rear view mock-up.</p>
<p>Allegedly sourced from Catcher Technology, Apple&rsquo;s metal chassis supplier, the leak bears a similar resemblance to iPhone 6s, with one noticeable difference &ndash; less&nbsp;conspicuous antenna strips.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9888" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/photo-iphone-7-catcher.jpg" alt="iPhone 7 leaked image" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Closer inspection of the grainy, and somewhat dubious, image seems to suggest that Apple has blended the antenna strips into the metal chassis, for a more seamless appearance.</p>
<p>This design, which we think is a mock-up based on the leaked photograph, gives you a clearer picture of what could be in store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9891" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/iPhone-7-PrePress-768x1388-567x1024.png" alt="iPhone 7 leaked image mock up" width="277" height="500" /></p>
<p>Due to poor quality of the on-screen photo, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to make any further conclusions, particularly when you would hope that such a leak would either confirm or dispel rumours that Apple&rsquo;s ditching the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Though the vacant space for the camera module <em>does </em>appear slightly larger, which could suggest that iPhone 7&nbsp;will feature a camera lens that's flush to the chassis, rather than the protruding lens of iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to say that you don&rsquo;t have long to wait until rumours become reality, but sadly, the expected launch date for iPhone 7 is likely still some months away, pegged for a September release.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all tears and tiny violins, however. It&rsquo;s been heavily rumoured that Apple will be unveiling a smaller, 4-inch iPhone &ndash; dubbed iPhone 5SE &ndash; this March. Of course nothing has been confirmed by the elusive Cupertino company, but MacRumours as pencilled an event in for 21<sup>st</sup> March.</p>
<p><strong>You can read more about the fabled iPhone 5SE in our round-up <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/news/iphone-5se-tipped-for-a-mid-march-announcement">here</a>. Stay tuned for more on both that and the equally as mysterious iPhone 7.</strong></p>
