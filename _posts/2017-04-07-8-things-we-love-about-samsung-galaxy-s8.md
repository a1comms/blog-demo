<p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 is finally here and we just can&rsquo;t get enough of it. From some of the wildest futuristic features to a brand new AI system, there&rsquo;s just oh-so-much to love about this latest device. Don&rsquo;t believe us? Well, check out these eight fabulous things we love about the phone.</p>
<h3>1. The iris scanner is seriously futuristic</h3>
<p>You may well think that unlocking your phone with just a look sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but that doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case at all. In fact, the new Samsung Galaxy S8 is bringing that seemingly futuristic tech into the here and now. The new iris scanner is just above the display, which means that you can essentially unlock your phone simply by glancing down at it.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the fingerprint scanner, which has now been moved to the back of the device, just below the camera lens. This two security features mean that you and you alone should be able to open your phone in an instant.</p>
<h3>2. You can control your phone with voice commands</h3>
<p>Bixby has been the word on everyone&rsquo;s lips since the phone launched last week. Yes, the AI offering is sure to be one of the biggest draws of the device, allowing users to operate their phone using nothing more than their voice. When you open up the feature, you can start using Bixby Voice to do a whole load of things on your Samsung Galaxy phone. From changing the display to making your screen brighter, there&rsquo;s no end to your power.</p>
<h3>3. The screen is actually&hellip; massive</h3>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with what they are calling an &lsquo;Infinity Screen&rsquo;. What that actually means is that the screen is pretty much endless; it takes up most of the phone. The device is almost bezeless, so it looks as though it&rsquo;s made up of just one massive screen.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an area that Samsung has been working on for quite some time. With each new device, it would seem that the screen has got bigger and bigger. This final, dramatic screen size is a massive advantage and sure to turn a whole load of heads.</p>
<h3>4. You could use it as a desktop computer</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the S8 is seriously powerful and that&rsquo;s something that Samsung really wants to show off here. That might explain the Samsung Dex feature. Essentially, this allows you to use your phone as the power station of a computer and scale everything up to a big, desktop screen. It might be something of a gimmick right now, but it&rsquo;s definitely impressive too.</p>
<h3>5. It&rsquo;s extremely water-resistant</h3>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a IP68 certificate, which means that it&rsquo;s seriously water-resistant. While you may not want to go deep-sea diving with this thing, it won&rsquo;t die the instant you spill a cup of water on it. The official claim is actually that you can use the phone in five feet of water for no more than 30 minutes. So, should you want to, you can use the phone in all conditions.</p>
<h3>6. It has a slick, minimal design</h3>
<p>It was one of the most eagerly awaited phones of the year, but everyone&rsquo;s patience seems to have paid off in a serious way. It looks extremely impressive! If you&rsquo;re a fan of all things simplistic, you will want to check out how this beauty looks.</p>
<p>What with the &lsquo;Infinity Display&rsquo; screen and the new minimal, sleek design, there&rsquo;s no getting around the fact that this is a sophisticated piece of technology. You should also notice the fact that it&rsquo;s a little slimmer than the S7 and no longer has a Home Button. All of these things combined mean that the phone is well worth your time.</p>
<h3>7. You can charge the device wirelessly</h3>
<p>Fancy putting your phone down on a pad and letting it charge away super quickly? Well, then the Samsung Galaxy S8 might just be the phone for you. Yes, one of the biggest advantages that this device has over say, the iPhone, is the fact that it offers this new-age feature. A phone that makes charging easier and quicker&hellip; What could be better than that?</p>
<h3>8. Oh, and its camera is pretty snazzy too</h3>
<p>Finally, we absolutely have to mention the camera. If you&rsquo;re a selfie addict (who isn&rsquo;t these days?!), you will love what the Samsung Galaxy S8 has to offer here. The front facing lens offers whopping 8-megapixel photos which are sure to impress the world of Instagram. Oh, and there are also loads of built-in filters and edits you can make which will take your selfie game to the very next level.</p>
