<p><span class="postStandFirst">Now that the LG G3 S has been unveiled, it&rsquo;s time to compare it to another recently unveiled &lsquo;mini&rsquo; phone, namely the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini. We take a look at this phenomenal pair, and pit them against each other&rsquo;s categories ranging from looks, to power, and so on, to see whether we can pick one out as the best &lsquo;mini&rsquo; super phone. It's the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini vs LG G3 S!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4649 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini vs LG G3 S" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/LG-G3-S-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S5.jpeg" width="516" height="467" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always fun to pit two phones together in a head-to-head scenario where, in the words of the immortal Connor MacLeod, &lsquo;there can be only one&rsquo;. Today, it&rsquo;s the turn of two new entries in a class of phones that has only recently come to the fore, namely &ldquo;mini versions of top-end superphones&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As it is clear by now, one of those phones is the newly unveiled LG G3 S, the mid-range sibling of the jaw-dropping LG G3. The other, meanwhile, is the mini version of the wildly popular Samsung Galaxy S5, the aptly named Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how their big siblings stack up against each other (and oh what an epic dust-up <i>that </i>was), so now it&rsquo;s time to find out how these two mini superphones compare, although one thing we have to say is that we&rsquo;re really stretching the definition of the word &lsquo;mini&rsquo;, here. You&rsquo;ll see why in presently.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s jump right in with...</p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>This should prove to be an interesting category, as both phones have a 720p screen. However, there are two big differences between them. The first is the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini sports a 4.5-inch Super AMOLED screen. That means it will boast richer colours, and better blacks.</p>
<p>The LG G3 S, meanwhile, has an IPS LCD screen, that comes in at 5-inches, which means that not only is it <i>bigger</i>, but it also has better viewing angles. Thus, since the two factors equal each other, albeit in different ways, we have to declare this round a draw.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4499" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G800H_GS5-mini_Black_10.jpg" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet confirmed exactly what processor the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini will have, but the information we&rsquo;re seeing indicates that its processor will be clocked to 1.4GHz. In addition to that, it will have 1.5GB of RAM, while the LG G3 S uses a processor clocked to 1.2GHz, and has 1GB of RAM.</p>
<p>And so, the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini is the winner of the Power category!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4498 aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/SM-G800H_GS5-mini_Black_Duos_2.jpg" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>On paper, the cameras within both phones are very similar (and they&rsquo;re mid-range phones, so don&rsquo;t expect the Duo Camera sorcery of the HTC One M8), both coming in at 8MP. However, the LG G3 S has a secret weapon, in the form of Laser Focus, which does not involve actual lasers, but allows the camera to focus a lot quicker.</p>
<p>Therefore, the LG G3 S has to be the winner, here!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4637 aligncenter" alt="LG G3 S rear" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/LG-G3-S-rear1-1024x1009.jpg" width="491" height="484" /></p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p>This category is always going to be about subjective taste, but we have to be honest, and say that for our money, the LG G3 S is the better-looking phone. Both phones are resolutely plastic, but the LG G3 S has a metallic-effect finish that looks, quite frankly, <i>gorgeous</i>.</p>
<p>And so, since it&rsquo;s the better-looking of the two, the LG G3 S wins this round!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-4633 aligncenter" alt="LG G3 S screen" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/LG-G3-S-screen-1024x768.jpg" width="768" height="576" /></p>
<h2>Special Features</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to special features, and we&rsquo;re not going to beat around the bush: the LG G3 S may be many things, but it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> water-resistant. The Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini is water-resistant, and since that&rsquo;s a feature we wish every phone had, the Samsung has to be the winner in this round!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, we reach a conclusion, as this battle to the death has turned out to be a dead heat! The simple fact is that both phones have so many fantastic features going for them, that we can&rsquo;t pick one outright winner (Connor MacLeod was therefore wrong, and there can be <i>more</i> than one, as it turns out), and the phone you ultimately pick will likely be down to a matter of personal taste, rather than outright objectivity.</p>
<p><strong>If you want a water-resistant phone, go for the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini. If you want a mid-range phone with a massive screen, go for the LG G3 S. Either way, you&rsquo;re going to be getting one of the best mid-range phones money can buy!&nbsp;</strong></p>
