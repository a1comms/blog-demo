<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Free chocolate, anybody?</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are few words in the English language that spark as much joy as &lsquo;free&rsquo;. Yes, just the sound of it should be enough to have us whipped up into a total frenzy. However, there&rsquo;s one small addition that could make it so much better: chocolate. Yum.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Luckily, if you happen to be a Vodafone customer, you can combine those two magic words and make your chocolaty dreams come true. That&rsquo;s because, to celebrate the Easter holiday, the network provider will be offering you some awesome rewards, including free chocolate. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know and how you can get yours.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2>Easter Treats from VeryMe Rewards</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As part of the VeryMe Rewards loyalty scheme, Vodafone offers a whole range of deals and freebies to their customers. These offers change regularly, and so it&rsquo;s always worth checking your app when you get the chance. With that in mind, what oh-so-special treats can you expect from Vodafone this Easter season?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tesco Chocolate and Easter Eggs </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you happen to be passing by your local Tesco, make sure that you pop in sooner rather than later. Vodafone customers can get themselves either some free chocolate or an entire Easter egg. Delicious. The offer is available until 21st April, so you&rsquo;d better move fast!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheap Cinema Tickets </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Planning a date night sometime soon? Or perhaps you fancy taking the family to see a movie? Either way, the VeryMe Rewards scheme might have just the thing. Customers can get themselves two Odeon cinema tickets for just &pound;7. Talk about a bargain! The offer is only valid for 2D screenings.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kids&rsquo; Pass </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since the school break is here, you might be looking for a way to entertain your little ones. For just &pound;1, Vodafone customers can get themselves a Kids&rsquo; Pass. The discount scheme offers 57% off selected family attractions plus money off restaurants and hotels too.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>How to get your goodies</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First of all, you need to make sure that you have the <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/my-vodafone-account/vodafone-apps/my-vodafone-app">My Vodafone app</a>. It&rsquo;s 100% free (yes!) for Vodafone customers and you can download it on either iOS or Android devices.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Easter themed treats can be redeemed using the VeryMe Rewards loyalty scheme. As you may already know, the more time you spend using the app and scheme, the more tailored your rewards will be. It&rsquo;s time to get tapping!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you launch the app, you can start browsing and check out the latest freebies and rewards that are available to you. Since the app is location-based, you may even get some exclusive deals that are only available in your specific area. Great stuff.</p>
