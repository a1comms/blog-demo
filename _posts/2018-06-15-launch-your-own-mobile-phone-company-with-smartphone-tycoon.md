<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Think you can do better than Apple and Samsung?</span></p>
<p>Meet Smartphone Tycoon, the mobile gaming app that puts you in control of a smartphone start-up with aspirations of world domination! With over 1 million installs, and over 38,000 reviews, Smartphone Tycoon is pretty popular right now.</p>
<p>Just for you, we look at this cool mobile gaming app and see whether it's really like the real deal.</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>So, what's the game all about? A word from the app creators as listed on its Google Play page: &ldquo;Welcome to Smartphone Tycoon! In this business simulator you can create your own smartphone company. Issue bestsellers and explore new technologies to expand your business and reinvent new smartphones. Become a market leader and get fans around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the game and the crafting of an iPhone X lookalike:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll start the game with $50 million, which, you might think is a lot right? Wrong! Give it a go and see how much the phones cost to make, but, please remember, it&rsquo;s a fictional game.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created and launched your first phone with the technology you have available, you&rsquo;ll be able to research some new tech to help make your next phone a beast, including: screens, cameras, colours, phone design, to name a few. This will hopefully allow you sell more, and you can then invest your profits into your next smartphone creation.</p>
<p>Smartphone Tycoon is made more realistic as you hire new employees, upgrade your office and even invest in some marketing to help sell more of your smartphones.</p>

<p>On the homepage, you'll get a view of your office, the number of fans you have, your company value and a running count of your latest phone sales. Be mindful though, the critics will also rate your latest smartphone release, and this could affect sales.</p>
<p>As for your fan base, if you create great smartphones, it will gradually grow. If your phones lack a certain panache, you may lose fans, then lose sales. Simples.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17730" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l3lnTvFexpGMowJNK-g64ur1e49DgRNviPZcHSERRPK-oI_DhMitptjsMpDlZAF-oAEobGrUAmIaGIxPPTa_ap0=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you get deeper into the game, you&rsquo;ll be able to create a presentation of your handsets and unearth new product technology to use. You can even start researching your own operating system.</p>
<p>You'll continue to use your new knowledge to launch new and better handsets than the previous models, on your way to global domination.</p>
<h2>Where to Get It</h2>
<p>The game is available to download from Google Play and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smartphone-tycoon-inc/id1385577457?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>You can play on your smartphone, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/contract-tablets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android tablet</a>, or iPad. A small warning though, it's pretty addictive.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Smartphone Tycoon is wonderfully free. As goes with this type of game though, there are some in-app purchases to help enhance your experience, but the free version is great all the same.</p>
<p>You do however, have to make do with the odd advert from time to time. Be we can just about live with that.</p>
