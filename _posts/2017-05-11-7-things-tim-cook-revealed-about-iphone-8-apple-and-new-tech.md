<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple's Tim Cook opens up about iPhone and the future.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so rare that we get an insight into what&rsquo;s going on at Apple HQ. These guys like to keep things pretty close to their chest when it comes to future plans and what they&rsquo;re plotting. In a recent interview, though, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed just a little about what the company has in store. Here are some key takeaways.</p>
<h2>1) iPhone 8 Rumours Are Slowing iPhone 7 Sales</h2>
<p>When rumours of a new phone start to fly, it has a weird effect on customers. Cook revealed since <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-8-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank">iPhone 8</a> news has been hitting the headlines more and more, iPhone 7 sales have slowed down a little.</p>
<p>When news of a new product starts to seep into the media, it always has the same effect. "When that happens a percentage of people delay,&rdquo; explained Cook. &ldquo;That probably affects us more in China than other places because there's a tendency there to buy the latest thing. Although I have to say, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank">7 Plus</a> has done extraordinarily well there.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>2) Apple Watch 3 and AirPods 2 Might Be Coming Soon</h2>
<p>Right now, both Apple Watches and AirPods depend on an iPhone to fully function. So, the question on everybody&rsquo;s lips is, when we will see a change in this? After all, the future of these wearables must be grounded in them working independent of your phone.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12731" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-12731" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KMqBPzu3PPR7gvYIlWEvO2OUQHqTUcIT2h7upS9C6PJ3LLaybON_kiRnT5_GnV__VGCnGJl33fXmxpxsfcqeUxFboQ=s0" width="600" height="315" /> Apple AirPods - great for music and talking to Siri[/caption]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the question of when (if at all!) that will happen is one that Cook just did not answer. Still, he did say that there were some exciting things coming very soon for Apple fans. &ldquo;I wouldn't want to comment on that [the possibility of untethered wearables], but we do have a really great pipeline here.&rdquo; said Cook.</p>
<h2>3) Getting the iPhone 8 You Want Should Be Easy</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want a rose gold iPhone 8&hellip; In theory, it should be easy to get one. When Apple originally released the iPhone 7, there were not enough Plus versions of the device to go around. The jet black model was like gold dust!</p>
<p>Luckily, anticipating demand is something that Apple has learned from, and shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern for the iPhone 8 launch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted,&rdquo; admitted Cook. &ldquo;What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>4) Apple May Take on Netflix</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that in the tech world, Apple dominates. So, where else is there to go right now? Well, taking on Netflix may just be Apple&rsquo;s next big move. This was something that Cook has hinted at, rather heavily. It would seem that he&rsquo;s ready to take things to a whole new level when it comes to media and entertainment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13816" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v82tgwjWXZRnIdaTvGjNV7EFA9UrYM2iWvg877Gm7BYM1VpAlYZg9scnxgNxnsD_m8JL67XkwQ5xakvHQhd83lPG4Q=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Talking of the video streaming market, Cook said: &ldquo;We'd like to play in this. Because we do think that the best experience for a customer is to view things when they want, the way they want, and have many different additional information &mdash; around what they're watching, not just the linear TV feed. We are working on some original content now. We're learning. And we'll see where this takes us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>5) iPhone 8 May Have One or Two Surprises</h2>
<p>With every new iPhone that hits the market, people expect something bigger, better, and more high tech. In short, it takes a whole lot to impress consumers in this day and age. At the start of 2017, there was a 1% decline in iPhone sales.</p>
<p>When Cook was questioned on this, though, by CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer, he explained that he had no worries of that sort whatsoever. &ldquo;No, because it's always something that you didn't expect,&rdquo; he said, referring to the next iPhone and why people will still want to get their hands on it. The takeaway is that the iPhone 8 may well have a few surprises in store to keep us interested.</p>

<h2>6) AI and AR Are a Big Deal</h2>
<p>While we may not know what the surprises are just yet, Cook did go ahead and give a few hints. One of the major ones was that Apple may be upping the graphic performance on iPhone 8 to improve both AI (artificial intelligence) and AR (augmented reality). Interesting, no?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think AI is huge,&rdquo; Cook said. &ldquo;We use AI in so much of what we do today. But we're going to be able to use it even more in the future. The processing and GPUs are getting so incredible &ndash; their capabilities so incredible we're going to be able to do a lot more. I don't want to get into details, but there's a lot more there. AR, you know, I've said in the past, this is something we're really excited about.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>7) India Could Be the Future of Apple</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time that Cook has mentioned India. In this latest interview, the subject came up yet again and it seems that Apple&rsquo;s top guy has a whole load of faith in this country, and the future it may well hold for the tech giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We've been investing quite a bit,&rdquo; Cook said. &ldquo;We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. Now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded there is a huge opportunity for Apple there.&rdquo;</p>
