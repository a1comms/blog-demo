<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Has your tummy got the rumbles? When you&rsquo;re feeling peckish and can&rsquo;t be bothered to cook, there&rsquo;s only one logical answer. Yes, it&rsquo;s time to treat yourself and order a deliciously naughty takeaway. It&rsquo;s probably a form of self-care&hellip; although, don&rsquo;t quote me on that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back in the dark ages, this task meant finding takeaway menus&ndash; which were likely stuffed deep down in the bottom drawer&ndash; and calling a number. Then, a few decades later, food delivery apps came along to make ordering food less of a headache.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Well, hold onto your seats because we&rsquo;ve levelled up again. Google has just launched a brand-new feature that will make satisfying your hunger as easy as pie. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>How to Order Food with Google Maps or Search</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ordering a cheeky takeaway via Google Maps or Search could not be easier. Seriously. The first step is to look up your favourite restaurant or, indeed, restaurants in your area. When you get your search results, you will see a self-explanatory &lsquo;Order Online&rsquo; button next to each listing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you click it, you will see multiple delivery options along with any charges that could apply when you choose them. That&rsquo;s great news for all you bargain-hunters out there. Put simply, it means that you can find the lowest possible delivery fee in no time at all.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next, it&rsquo;s time to order your food. Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to leave your Google app to do this. The new feature means that you can choose your takeaway, order it and even pay through it using either Google Maps or Google Search. (However, you will need to have Google Pay to use this particular part of the service!)</p>

<h2>How to Order Food with Google Assistant</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is it too much trouble to type your order? We hear you! If you would rather speak to get your food, there&rsquo;s a way to do that too. The new delivery feature will also be available when you&rsquo;re using Google Assistant. So, you can use the app to talk through a new order or re-order a takeaway that you&rsquo;ve had before. What more could you want?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sadly, though, the feature is limited to the Google Assistant app right now. You won&rsquo;t be able to use your Home device to order some food just yet. But, let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Google rolls this feature out across all its devices. Watch this space.</p>
