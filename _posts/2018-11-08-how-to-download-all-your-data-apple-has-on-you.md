<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Hint: It&rsquo;s easier than you think!</span></p>
<p>The technological world can seem like rather a scary place. Worried about the information Apple has about you? Wondering what data the mega-brand has collected on you over the years? You&rsquo;re probably not alone. If you&rsquo;ve been an iPhone and Mac user for quite some time, you worry that the company has a whole load of your data backed up.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s no major conspiracy at play here. Nope, you can see the data that Apple has stored and it might be less than you expect.</p>
<p>Thanks to Apple&rsquo;s revamped portal and new GDPR regulations, you can check out and download all of the data that the company has stored on your behalf. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>How to Download the Data</h2>
<p>First open <a href="https://privacy.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple&rsquo;s Privacy Window</a> and enter your Apple ID along with your password (you may also need to use two-factor authentication).</p>
<p>Press the &lsquo;<strong>Get a copy of your data</strong>&rsquo; tab and then &lsquo;<strong>Get started</strong>.&rsquo; When you&rsquo;ve done that, you will have two options. You can either choose the categories you want to download or go the whole hog and &lsquo;<strong>Select all</strong>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, it&rsquo;s something of a waiting game&hellip; You don&rsquo;t get your data download immediately.</p>
<p>In fact, Apple says that it can take up to seven days for the request to complete. That means that you will need to sit tight for a little while. However, when it&rsquo;s completed, you will get a request that allows you to download your data at the touch of a button (of course, you will likely have to split your data into smaller downloads too!).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you happen to be wondering what type of data Apple stores in general, there&rsquo;s a handy <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support page</a> that can help.</p>
<p>It lists the various forms of data that Apple keeps when you use their software and includes things like your Apple ID, Apple Music, transactions and more. Want to find out more? It&rsquo;s easy. Go ahead and take a look now!</p>
