<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple is reportedly due to take to the stage on September 9 to settle this year's iPhone speculation. We take a look at the iPhone 6 rumours, including the big one surrounding <em>two</em>&nbsp;upcoming iPhones, both of which reportedly sport bigger screens to compete with current Android super phones.</span></p>
<p>In one of the most anticipated annual moments in the mobile world, Apple will soon be taking the stage to take the wraps off its latest iPhone. Anticipation is already at fever pitch, over where the Cupertino giant will take its smartphone series next.</p>
<p>And so, with the date allegedly set for September 9, it&rsquo;s time for us to take a look at the rumours, and see if we can predict what Apple will soon be showing to the world.</p>
<h2>Two's better than one...</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4836" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/iPhone-5s-and-5c.jpg" alt="iPhone 5s and 5c" width="575" height="327" /></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest rumour is that Apple will once again be unveiling two iPhones, instead of just one. There&rsquo;s precedent for that, of course, after the manufacturer released the double-header of the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, but there&rsquo;s a difference this time round.</p>
<p>Those two phones were different in terms of what their bodies were made from, and the processor that sat beneath the hood. In the case of the iPhone 6, it&rsquo;s rumoured that the two variants will differ in terms of screen size, with the smaller one having a 4.7-inch screen, and the larger version supposedly having a 5.5-inch screen, putting it almost in phablet territory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps not surprising that Apple is rumoured to be going down this route, considering that most top-end rivals have screens larger than 5-inches (the HTC One M8, for example, and the LG G3). Whether it will indeed happen, though, remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>New specs, new power, new imaging?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4804" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/ilife_hero.jpg" alt="iPhone 5c" width="892" height="209" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard rumours about the features that we should expect on the new iPhone (or iPhones as the case may be), the first of which concerns a 2GHz dual-core Apple A8 processor. That would be fine upgrade in power over the processor found in the iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the camera is also rumoured to be getting an upgrade, from 8-megapixels to 13-megapixels, and on top of that, it&rsquo;s also said to be getting optical image stabilisation (OIS). If that proves to be true, then photos taken with the new iPhone are going to look more detailed and steadier than ever!</p>
<h2>Evidence from iOS 8?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4814" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/ios-8-1024x550.png" alt="ios 8" width="576" height="309" />Of course, the platform that will power the next iPhone has already been released, and is available to download to the iPhone 5s, so can we perhaps find some evidence of the rumours, within OS 8?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the answer might be yes. For one thing, the Photos app has been improved, with better image editing, which <i>might</i> suggest that a new camera is on the way. At the same time, iOS 8 includes support for third-party keyboards, including Swype and SwiftKey, and that swiping keyboard action has proven to be most effective on phones with big screens.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, that hints at those parts of the rumour being true...</p>
<h2>When can you get your hands on one?</h2>
<p>Whatever turns out to be true, though, the big question that&rsquo;s quite possibly running through your mind right about now is: <i>when will I be able to get one? </i></p>
<p>Well, reports are suggesting that Apple will be holding its highly anticipated iPhone event on September 9. The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will go on sale not long after the official unveiling, while the 5.5-inch iPhone will appear on store shelves later in the year, or perhaps 2015.</p>
<p><strong>At the moment, in spite of the leaks, everything we know about the next iPhone is merely supposition, but it seems likely that Apple has something big planned. Watch this space for more news!</strong></p>
