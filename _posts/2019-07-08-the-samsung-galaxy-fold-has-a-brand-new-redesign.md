<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The last two months has been a busy period for the designers over at Samsung. The team has been working hard on a redesign of the highly awaited Galaxy Fold.</p>
<p>Towards the start of the year, test versions of the device had some minor teething problems. After reports of these issues, the company pulled the device and set about rectifying things.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the wait for the redesigned phone is almost over. According to a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-03/samsung-seeks-redemption-with-redesigned-galaxy-fold-smartphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from Bloomberg, the company is now finalising the design of the device and will soon be ready to start making the commercial products. That&rsquo;s great news for anybody out there who is hoping to get their mitts on the futuristic smartphone sometime soon.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know so far about the phone&rsquo;s redesign and how it will look.</p>
<h2>What Can We Expect From the Redesign?</h2>
<p>Of course, when the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-fold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Fold</a> is released, it will be the first of its kind. It&rsquo;s a real trailblazer.</p>
<p>For that very reason, the designers at Samsung are having to overcome a range of brand new obstacles. Luckily, these have come up in the early development stages of the phone. There are a couple major changes that you should know about here.</p>
<p>First of all, that all-important hinge has moved. The redesigned version of the Galaxy Fold has the hinge slightly higher than previous versions, which means that it&rsquo;s flush with the screen.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, there is a protective film that stretches all the way around the whole display and the bezels as well. That small change should make the smartphone sturdier.</p>

<p>All of the above should lower the chances of the crease (where the phone folds) becoming visible the more people use it.</p>
<p>This issue has been a genuine concern for Samsung, and so it&rsquo;s great to see them dealing with it ahead of time. Basically, these minor alterations should mean that the high-end device lasts even longer.</p>

<h2>When Will the Fold Be Released?</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the major details about the Galaxy Fold redesign, you might have one more question. When will the snazzy, foldable smartphone be released?</p>
<p>While there is no official word from Samsung right now, we can take a somewhat educated stab in the dark here.</p>
<p>The chances are that the officials want the device to be ready for Christmas 2019, which means that we may see more about the Fold in the coming months. Exciting stuff.</p>
