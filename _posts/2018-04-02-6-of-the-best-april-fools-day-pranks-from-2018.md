<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">From spinning classes in the clouds to shoe-phones, here are the best pranks you may have missed!</span></p>
<p>Psst&hellip; Did you notice something a little fishy happening over the weekend. Yes, this year, April Fool&rsquo;s Day just so happened to land on Easter Sunday. That&rsquo;s a serious double whammy.</p>
<p>The annual day of foolery gave some of the world&rsquo;s biggest companies a chance to have a little fun and show their humorous side. So, here are some of the best pranks.</p>
<h2>1) Virgin Australia Offers In-Flight Spin Classes</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xp7oJkzL4o" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>As someone who has a horrific fear of flying, and an even stronger aversion to spin classes, this sounds like my idea of actual hell on earth&hellip; Well, off-earth, actually.</p>
<p>Yes, this year in an April Fool&rsquo;s prank that can only be described as diabolical, Virgin Australia promised us the fitness class that nobody wants &ndash; in-flight spinning.</p>
<p>In a fake advertisement, the airline claimed that to have coupled up with Virgin Active to offer spin studios on some of its planes. Luckily, there will be no working out above the clouds anytime soon as this was all one big joke.</p>
<h2>2) Netflix Acquires Seth Rogen</h2>
<p>Netflix went all out this year, sending out a press release, banner advert, and Twitter video that made a rather outlandish claim.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">***EXCLUSIVE: NETFLIX ACQUIRES SETH ROGEN IN UNPRECEDENTED BUSINESS MOVE*** <a href="https://t.co/0fgWHJhprh">pic.twitter.com/0fgWHJhprh</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Netflix US (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/980459836960894976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the streaming company said that it had &lsquo;acquired&rsquo; Seth Rogen. Wait, what? The actor starred in the video, in which he read out his new contract with Netflix, aka &lsquo;Seth&rsquo;s Owners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This prank wasn&rsquo;t just about getting a few giggles either! It was a promotion for <a href="https://hilarityforcharity.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilarity for Charity</a>, a fundraiser started by Seth and his wife, Lauren Miller Rogen. The show goes live on Netflix on 6th April and will raise awareness for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<h2>3) Elon Musk Drinks Too Much &lsquo;Teslaquilla&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Of course, Elon Musk got involved in the April Fool&rsquo;s Day shenanigans. His prank came in the form of a series of tweets which made some pretty wild statements. From saying that there was important news to come, to claiming that Tesla has gone &lsquo;bankwupt,&rsquo; there was a whole load to love here.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by "Teslaquilla" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.</p>
<p>This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?</p>
<p>Happy New Month! <a href="https://t.co/YcouvFz6Y1">pic.twitter.com/YcouvFz6Y1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/980566116614291456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The tweets finished with a statement which said that he &lsquo;was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by "Teslaquilla" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.&rsquo; Needless to say, Elon seems to have no problem at all poking a little fun at himself every now and then.</p>
<h2>4) Google Maps Asks, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Wally?&rsquo;</h2>
<p>If you checked out Google Maps on Easter Sunday, you would have seen something quite exciting. Yes, the company decided to give us all a massive dose of nostalgia in the form of a playable game.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">FYI You can play Where&rsquo;s Wally in Google Maps for April Fool&rsquo;s Day. <a href="https://t.co/fv2Sy4i8NQ">pic.twitter.com/fv2Sy4i8NQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Special J (@jamessalvona) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamessalvona/status/980246988233965568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When you opened the app, or went to the on-site browser, you saw a pop-up asking you to go ahead and find Wally across the globe. Did you manage it?</p>
<h2>5) Lego Solves All Your Brick Sorting Problems</h2>
<p>As any parent can testify, there are few things more painful than walking barefoot into your child&rsquo;s bedroom and treading on a piece of LEGO. If you haven&rsquo;t experienced it, think about the last time you stubbed your little toe, or knocked your shin against the corner of the coffee table.</p>
<p>Well, LEGO took full advantage by announcing the VacuSort, which, if it were real, would apparently vacuum up LEGO pieces, and even sort them into colour and type. If only, LEGO, if only&hellip;</p>

<h2>6) T-Mobile launches a Smartshoephone</h2>
<p>The world of smartphones is ever-advancing, so it was only a matter of time before someone decided to make a smartshoephone, right? T-Mobile&rsquo;s hilarious April Fool&rsquo;s joke unveiled its latest offering &ndash; Sidekicks.</p>
<h2><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQQuOICUylQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h2>
<p>In a promo video, the company claimed that one of the shoes has a speaker on the bottom, while the other has a screen. And the laces? Why, they&rsquo;re earphones, of course. (Oh, and you can <a href="https://www.bemagenta.com/shop/new/t-mobile-sidekicks-pre-order/p-TM0286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-order the shoes</a> online&hellip; without the smartphone part of them!)</p>
