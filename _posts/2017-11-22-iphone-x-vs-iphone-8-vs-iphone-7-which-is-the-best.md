<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We compare to help you find the best iPhone.</span></p>
<p>Is it time for an upgrade? If you&rsquo;re an Apple fan, luckily, you&rsquo;ve got a whole load of options. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s look at what you can expect from some of the most modern iPhone devices and whether you should take the leap and upgrade.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s deal with the elephant in the room. Yes, the new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Plus</a> look pretty similar to previous incarnations. Compared to iPhone 7 and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Plus</a>, there aren&rsquo;t all that many differences to take in.</p>
<p>The overall design is much of the same, looking sleek and stylish, with the iconic home button adorning the front. The back, however, does differ between iPhone 8 and iPhone 7, where the newer iPhone is fashioned from strengthened glass as opposed to metal.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0DN-BZrM4o" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>iPhone X, though, takes on a big design change compared to iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. But we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ve already noticed that.</p>
<p>Yes, iPhone X boasts almost no bezels, and not even a home button. There&rsquo;s an indent, or &lsquo;notch&rsquo;, at the top of the screen, where the face scanning technology sits (more on that later). The overall look of iPhone X is far more futuristic than we&rsquo;ve ever seen on an iPhone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bs_AQejjL-g1UzUTaHa8pVnh_JlfDkGp969l2FVyfaflS2O3x0bmHi2-QsJuz347Wb5GS7pe_5Kc5IhxnkNdtUTr=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>That brings us neatly onto the display. Immediate impressions may suggest not much has changed on iPhone 8, compared to iPhone 7. The screen sizes and resolutions are the same, with the smaller iPhone model featuring a 4.7-inch display, and the larger one a 5.5-inch display.</p>
<p>The quality of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus display has improved, though, with better colour reproduction than previous models, for a more realistic experience overall when watching video and looking at pictures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14946" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1jz1SOKYyM3PYyrmGv1sLmFTEz4GaOm9pLD-BBd0dWIe6PyefSk92fv0lqOzBX4jQX0o4fujZAaEGlYKCgrwcvZf=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>On to iPhone X, which is the first Apple device to use the OLED screen. The idea is that this should give a richer colour than ever before, as well as deeper blacks too. On previous models, Apple has used an IPS LED display which, while good, doesn&rsquo;t compete as well.</p>
<p>Plus, because of the economical use of space, iPhone X features the largest iPhone display, on a body that&rsquo;s smaller than iPhone 8 Plus. The result is a handset that&rsquo;s pretty much all-screen, and fantastic for enjoying content.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14933" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RfiV3K7Qd9y8k8wcW7Z8ODAvabQ5nFBAAfLXS_zqYdPRNEgR_YTRG0rZIfeO9zfdyuELOczxLXUUxPfN8PvWSwzn=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Size and Feel</h2>
<p>In iPhone 7/8, iPhone 7/8 Plus and iPhone X, you have three different sizes to choose from.</p>
<p>iPhone 7 and 8 are the most compact, with a 4.7-inch display and dimensions of 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (slightly larger on iPhone 8 at 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm). The smaller size makes these two iPhone models easier to use with just one hand, and more comfortable in your pocket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14944" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NFEXUcgU1r4eUr9GElCdC4VDBypdqvr78p_n8cZQ4ZDEPQ72CqN_0tOr_HIonaT3D7cBQ7yGDowSjp8pURMQe_MZ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus are, of course, bigger devices, featuring 5.5-inch displays and dimensions measuring 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (again, iPhone 8 Plus is slightly larger at 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5 mm). The extra size makes the Plus editions better for enjoying video content, and generally for experiencing a bigger picture.</p>
<p>iPhone X is different in that it boasts the biggest display, but because the bezels and home button have been removed, it&rsquo;s more compact than iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus. It squeezes a large 5.8-inch display into tight dimensions that come in at 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7 mm. So, you get the big screen experience on a smaller phone. The perfect compromise.</p>
<h2>Face ID</h2>
<p>Of iPhone 7, iPhone 8 and iPhone X, the latter is the only model to feature Apple&rsquo;s new Face ID.</p>
<p>What does it do? Well, simply put, instead of a fingerprint scanner Face ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone X, authenticate purchases, sign in to apps and take control of emoji.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14936" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_UBvRRgO6WLkTyUxDjr5CbdqUDpRgJgJpbMD_RZeSrurZRgZh4_E0_nN3ViFZGiAvNau7tDJ-yTGkiUgY8c6Dj4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>No doubt, that last feature caught your attention. Yes, iPhone X allows you to take control of an emoji, mimicking your facial expressions and movements, creating personalised messages that are more than just a bit of fun.</p>
<p>The facial recognition technology is pretty sophisticated; it can&rsquo;t be fooled by a photo of you. The new depth sensing camera ensures that. Combined the "Flood Illuminator" and the "Dot Projector&rdquo; use a total of 3,000 IR dots to make sure that your face is, indeed, your face.</p>

<p>As for iPhone 8, Apple has stuck with the old faithful Touch ID feature, built into the home button. That tech is the same as on iPhone 7, which means that there&rsquo;s no major upgrade here just yet.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting. Both iPhone 8 and iPhone X have an upgraded processing system, compared to iPhone 7. The six-core A11 system-on-a-chip (SoC) should mean that both devices are significantly faster than their predecessors.</p>
<p>The upgrade will be especially noticeable on the more demanding apps and games, made increasingly more obvious as time progresses and more advanced apps are released. For your everyday tasks, like checking emails and Facebook, you&rsquo;ll be fine with an iPhone 7.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4wEI5zhHB0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount of variation in price between these iPhone models. Starting with iPhone 7, you can pick one up on contract from just &pound;32.99 a month, with nothing to pay upfront. <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 7 Plus</a> is a tad more, at &pound;39.00 a month. Again, with nothing to pay upfront.</p>
<p>Naturally, the newer <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 is a little more, at &pound;42.00 a month</a>, &pound;0 upfront. And <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, with that extra size, comes in at &pound;48.00 a month with nothing to pay upfront.</p>
<p>Finally, the best of the best commands a worthy price. You can get an iPhone X today on contract for &pound;69.00 a month, with &pound;49.99 to pay upfront.</p>
