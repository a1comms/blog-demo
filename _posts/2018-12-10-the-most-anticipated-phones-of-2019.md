<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Start off the fresh phone fever!</span></p>
<p>May the new year bring us all health, wealth, happiness&hellip; and oodles of new phones. If you&rsquo;re excited about the latter, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here are the 5 most anticipated handsets of 2019 and what we know about them so far.</p>
<h2>1) Samsung Galaxy S10</h2>
<p>Evan Blass, a self-proclaimed &lsquo;phone gossip', <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1071247338843320320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that there will be not one, not two, <em>but three</em> new S10 devices. The leak suggests that there will be an S10 Lite with a 5.8-inch screen, an S10 with a 6.1-inch screen, and an S10+ with a 6.4-inch screen.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A case manufacturer's expectations for the Galaxy S10 lineup: <a href="https://t.co/lrExjvalcb">pic.twitter.com/lrExjvalcb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Evan Blass (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1071247338843320320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. Experts also believe that all of the devices will pack an Infinity-O display - possibly Samsung's next-gen screen setup. Other <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BrAWF_bBC_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sources</a> suggest that the Galaxy S10 devices will have the selfie-cam on the side of the phone and a bezeless look. The design is rumoured to be quite similar to the stunning <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s9-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy S9</a> device we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>
<p>It's anticipated that we'll get a first look at the next Samsung device early in 2019. Based on past year's, Samsung tends to host its launch events at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, around February. The brand holds a second even later in the year around August.</p>
<h2>2)&nbsp;Xiaomi Mi Mix 3</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush &ndash; 5G phones are the future. Last week, Xiaomi <a href="http://blog.mi.com/en/2018/12/06/news-xiaomi-showcases-5g-version-of-mi-mix-3-with-snapdragon-855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> what&rsquo;s sure to be one of its biggest devices of 2019. Although, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is already available in regions across the world, a 5G version of the Mi Mix 3 could be available in Europe as early as the start of next year, with a big presence expected at Mobile World Congress in February 2019. Packing both the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and an X50 5G modem, the device should be super speedy.</p>
<p>Since the fifth generation of mobile internet will be launching on some networks at selected locations around the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/ee-announces-the-cities-that-will-get-5g-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK next year</a>, 2019 will be the time to invest in a 5G compatible device.</p>

<h2>3) Huawei P30/Mate 30</h2>
<p>Over the course of 2018, Huawei is a brand that has risen to new heights. Back in July, the President of Huawei&rsquo;s Western European Consumer Business Group gave an <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/confirmed-huawei-p30-or-mate-5g-smartphones-coming-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview to T3</a> in which he confirmed that they will bring a 5G phone out in 2019.</p>
<p>So, when can we get our hands on either the Huawei P30 or the Mate 30? Well, he also explained that the P-series phone will be out in March and the Mate will be out in October (this timeline would be in line with the brands other releases in 2018). However, he did not confirm the exact names of each of the models.</p>

<h2>4) OnePlus 7/7T</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s also massive rumours going around that the OnePlus 7 or 7T will be one of the first devices to offer 5G capabilities. The word comes from <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/362147/oneplus-commits-to-5g-phone-us-carrier-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCMag</a>, the publication that reported that the company has &lsquo;committed to a 5G phone.&rsquo; People have theorised that the device could either be the 7 or 7T, although nothing has been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t know exactly when the device will be released yet, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/oneplus-will-be-the-first-to-release-a-5g-phone-in-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company has said</a> that it will be releasing a 5G phone in the UK at some point during 2019. The business&rsquo; CEO also confirmed that the device will use Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset.</p>
<p>With the launch of the OnePlus 6 device in May, and global launch of its 6T variant in October 2018, it would be accurate to assume its flagship releases will follow suit in the coming year too.</p>

<h2>5) New iPhone 2019</h2>
<p>Apple tends to release its flagships in September, which means that we will have some time to wait before seeing what it's got in store.</p>
<p>Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/15/kuo-2019-iphone-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that there will be three new iPhone devices in 2019 and the lineup will be similar to that of this year's, certainly in terms of size, with a 5.8-inch, 6.1-inch, and 6.5-inch model rumoured to be launched.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The rumour-mill has most certainly been churning. While we&rsquo;ve got a few hints about the phones being released in 2019, there&rsquo;s so much more to come our way. It&rsquo;s safe to say that, the moment we hear a scrap of new gossip, we will be reporting it directly to you. Watch this space.</p>
