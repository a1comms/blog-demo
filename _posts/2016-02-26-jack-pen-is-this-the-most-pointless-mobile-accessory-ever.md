<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">I read somewhere that after the television was invented, a lot of people thought that was it, that we&rsquo;d reached the pinnacle of where human civilisation could go. What more was there left to create? They thought we had it all. Now, I realise how wrong they were. No, not because of the staggering leaps we&rsquo;re making in artificial intelligence, or the new horizons being conquered by the world&rsquo;s leading space agencies. But because of Jack Pen. The plug-in biro.</span></p>
<p><em>Yes,&nbsp;</em>that was irony.</p>
<p>Meet Jack Pen, the world&rsquo;s most pointless mobile phone accessory. Let me describe to you what it is and what it does in as much details as I can.</p>
<p>Jack Pen is a tiny pen that plugs into a headphone jack and writes things.</p>
<p>No, really, that&rsquo;s it. Someone has honestly dedicated a portion of their life to producing really small biros for mobile phones. This is not a joke.</p>
<p>When a colleague showed Jack Pen to me, I had to take five minutes just to make sense of the sudden barrage of confusing emotions&nbsp;and tormenting questions that washed over me.</p>
<p>Like, when did we all get so much time on our hands? And, what did humanity do to deserve something so utterly redundant as Jack Pen? Sadly, I still haven&rsquo;t found the&nbsp;answers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8765" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/slider6.png" alt="Jack Pen plugged into iPhone" width="600" height="290" /></p>
<p>As you can see, Jack Pen just slots into your smartphone&rsquo;s headphone jack like it&rsquo;s no big deal, and you&rsquo;re literally expected to write like your phone&rsquo;s the most awkward pen in the world. It&rsquo;s mental.</p>
<p>I can understand the convenience of always having a pen to hand, but if that pen is plugged into your smartphone &ndash; which lets you compose digital notes quickly and easily &ndash; then the whole concept becomes utterly, utterly pointless.</p>
<p>Jack Pen is a &lsquo;solution&rsquo; to a <em>minor</em> problem, where the problem itself is actually more desirable than the offered &lsquo;solution&rsquo;. In other words, no-one wants a cheap, nubbin of plastic protruding from the base of their iPhone, looking like a hideous and unwelcomed growth.</p>
<p>In essence, Jack Pen is to mobile phones what a pair of running shoes would be to a goldfish, or what a lead weight might&nbsp;be to someone free-falling from a plane. Just ridiculously useless.</p>
<p>According to Jack Pen&rsquo;s webpage, this monstrosity was featured on &lsquo;Dragons&rsquo; Den&rsquo;, yet, despite all of the entrepreneurial instincts and business acumen shared between the absurdly wealthy Dragons, Jack Pen came away with no financial support&hellip; Shocking, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being unfair. We have to give the Jack Pen team some credit, because anyone who can successfully market and sell even one plug-in pen for mobiles, deserves a pat on the back. Swiftly followed by a slap in the face.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Jack Pen, you&rsquo;re still not as baffling&nbsp;as the banana bunker.</p>
