<p>We all know and love the Nokia 3310 as one of the hardiest mobile phones ever. But, how will it stand against a newer rival, the Samsung Galaxy S10.</p>
<p>If it makes you a little uneasy watching a &pound;799.00 mobile phone dropped from a ridiculous height, you should probably look away now.</p>
<p>Those of you that are still here are not doubt intrigued enough to see what the messy or not so messy outcome is.</p>
<h2>The Drop!</h2>
<p>Popular YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc4Puw-BYXw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UnlockRiver.com</a>, embarks on this quest to see which handset will survive.</p>
<p>After unwrapping the Galaxy device fresh out the box, the host proceeds to strap on his hard hat and get the Galaxy ready for the flight of its life. Hoisted up to 1000ft by a drone with its Nokia 3310 counterpart, this is where it gets very interesting.</p>
<p>These guys take durability testing to a whole new level. See the results for yourself in the video below.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably no surprise that both devices were almost turned into jam with this experiment.</p>
<p>But, the Nokia 3310 still worked! No surprise there.&nbsp;We wish we could say the same for the Galaxy S10 though, sorry guys.</p>

<p>That said, the Galaxy held together well. With a shattered front and back, you could probably still make out the screen easy enough. The rear cameras don&rsquo;t look to bad either!</p>
<p>The good people at UnlockRiver.com decide to award the Galaxy S10 a durability score of 5/10! A middle of the park score from the YouTubers here.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10: In a Nutshell</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S10 launched in March this year, sporting a revolutionary Infinity-O display that was rated as &ldquo;visually indistinguishable from perfect&rdquo; by <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-gets-highest-ever-screen-rating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DisplayMate</a> (the handset review people).</p>

<p>Not only that, it has a triple camera set up and an in-screen selfie camera that offers seamless, uninterrupted mobile viewing. Its screen also houses an Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, moving its speedy phone access feature back to the front of the Galaxy device.</p>
<p>Other innovative features include Wireless PowerShare with devices that are compatible for wireless charging. This device can pretty much do it all.</p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that if you love your smartphone, please don&rsquo;t try this sort of thing at home. It can be a very expensive exercise. Stay safe out there.</p>
