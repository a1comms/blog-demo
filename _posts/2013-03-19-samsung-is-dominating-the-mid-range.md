<p>One manufacturer has done more than anyone else, to take Android to its current epic heights, and that manufacturer is&nbsp;Samsung.</p>
<p>Everyone has heard of superstar phones like the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3&nbsp;but then, that&rsquo;s hardly surprising. The Galaxy S3 is the most popular Android phone&nbsp;<em>ever</em>, by a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;margin, although it seems likely that it will be dethroned by its successor, the truly magnificent&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>However, Android isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;seen in top-end phones. It also powers a wide swathe of mid-range phones, although it&rsquo;s probably not surprising to hear that, while they were historically made by&nbsp;HTC, the most popular mid-range phones on the market are currently&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;made by Samsung.</p>
<p>What may be slightly surprising, though, is that one of them (and it&rsquo;s arguably the&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;mid-range phone on the market) was never meant to be a mid-range phone in the first place.</p>
<p>Since the most popular Android phone ever is the Samsung Galaxy S3, few people were surprised to see that one of the most popular, and best, mid-range phones on the market is the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini. It shares the same design aesthetic as both of its &lsquo;big brothers&rsquo;, the aforementioned Galaxy S3 and the huge, more tablet-oriented&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note II. All three phones have slim, curved bodies that feel beautiful in the hand, and they all use gorgeous Super AMOLED screens that produce high contrasts and vivid, brilliant colours. In the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, this screen comes in at four inches.</p>
<p>Essentially, this phone&rsquo;s name is entirely accurate; it really is what you get if you take a Galaxy S3, and shrink it down to the mid-range market.</p>
<p>However, there&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;another phone that challenges it for the title of best mid-range phone, and it&rsquo;s also made by Samsung. The surprising part is that when it was first released, it wasn&rsquo;t a mid-range phone at all; instead, it was the best of the best, the flagship in Samsung&rsquo;s portfolio, because it is, of course, the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy SII.</p>
<p>It may seem odd to call that phone a mid-ranger, but as technology progresses, what was once the top-end becomes commonplace. It happens in&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;industry, from cars to mobile phones, and for&nbsp;consumers, it&rsquo;s actually a brilliant thing, because the simple fact of the matter is this: a phone doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>stop</em>&nbsp;being brilliant just because newer phones are released. The Samsung Galaxy SII, quite simply, has still got it. It actually has a slightly&nbsp;<em>higher</em>&nbsp;spec than the Galaxy S3 Mini (although the price is slight as a result, while still being well within the mid-range), with a bigger screen, a faster processor, and a bigger battery.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, if you are searching for a mid-range phone, and want the best of the best, then the Samsung Galaxy SII is quite possibly the perfect phone. If, however, you want to save a few more pennies per month, then the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini has you covered.</p>
<p>Either way, it seems that no matter which of the two you go for, the best mid-range phone on the market is a Samsung!</p>
