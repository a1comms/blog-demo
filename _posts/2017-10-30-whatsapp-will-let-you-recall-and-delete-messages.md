<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You can finally delete those drunken messages.</span></p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a drunken proclamation of undying love, or an angry rant, we&rsquo;ve all sent messages we wish we could take back. The moment you hit the &lsquo;send&rsquo; button, you know you&rsquo;ve done wrong.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Delete, delete, delete!&rdquo; you scream to yourself. </em></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too late. The message has made its way into the cyberspace, and as we all know too well, there&rsquo;s no way of getting it back. Or, at least, that&rsquo;s how things <em>used</em> to work.</p>
<p>The rules have changed (at least for some users), because WhatsApp is rolling out a feature that lets you <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/26000069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delete messages</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14037" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u4REr3DrGOrvdKz5_n_GXS2kkeiCanmJvOXuRY3kTf_WG3q2al4UDUsZ5UOX6bKL2fA7BbkRJhvnZsJRE7pqfLMf=s0" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<h2>Life's Undo Button</h2>
<p>WhatsApp's new delete feature will let you take back misjudged messages that you&rsquo;ve sent. What&rsquo;s more, it will work on both media messages and basic texts. This is one of life&rsquo;s best undo buttons yet.</p>
<p>The idea is that once you&rsquo;ve pressed send, it&rsquo;s not the end of the game. You still have a chance to take back those silly things you said when you weren&rsquo;t thinking straight. With just the tap of your phone, the text will disappear -&nbsp;hopefully before the recipient has read it. Here's what to do:</p>
<p>1) Open WhatsApp and head to the message you want to erase</p>
<p>2) Longhold the message until an options box appears</p>
<p>3) Press Delete and then (if it&rsquo;s a group message) Delete for Everyone</p>
<h2>The Seven-minute Rule!</h2>
<p>Of course, life would be too simple if that was the end of the story...</p>
<p>The WhatsApp message deletion feature does in fact come with a small caveat, in that you can&rsquo;t start recalling messages months after sending them. Actually, you have just seven minutes to recall your messages, because, after that point, the feature is no longer available.</p>
<h2>How to Get the WhatsApp &lsquo;Recall&rsquo; Feature</h2>
<p>This new message deletion feature is being rolled out gradually, which means it'll be available for different people at different times. However, there&rsquo;s one thing that you can do to check whether you&rsquo;re privy to it just yet &mdash; update your current version of WhatsApp and try the steps above.</p>
