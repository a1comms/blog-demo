<p><span class="postStandFirst">Smartphone giants Samsung and Apple have been clashing head to head for a number of years now. Their rivalry is by no means a secret, particularly after Samsung&rsquo;s latest, somewhat jovial, digs at Apple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5215 aligncenter" alt="Samsung poking fun at Apple" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-10.48.56.png" width="853" height="472" /></p>
<p>Samsung has reacted to Apple&rsquo;s unveiling of the &lsquo;bigger than bigger&rsquo; 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, with a series of six tongue in cheek YouTube videos that appear to tease Apple, using the tag &ldquo;It Doesn&rsquo;t Take A Genius&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is a shrewd and somewhat strategic marketing campaign from Samsung, as these parodies not only poke fun at its biggest competitor, they also promote Samsung&rsquo;s latest phablet &ndash; the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>

<p>For the very first time, Apple decided to live stream its iPhone event that it hosted last Tuesday. Unfortunately, things didn&rsquo;t quite pan out as smoothly as expected, as the stream dropped in and out every few seconds during the first half of the event. Presumably, this was a result of the sheer volume of traffic trying to access it.</p>

<p>Apple has come under fire from vociferous critics for its smaller displays, like the 4-inch one housed on the iPhone 5s. However, with the release of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, many of those critics seem to have been silenced. That being said, Samsung couldn&rsquo;t help but get one more dig in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that even two of the world&rsquo;s biggest technology companies can exchange some good-natured banter. Besides, we&rsquo;re positive Apple won&rsquo;t be too concerned about a jest here or there, particularly after the favourable reception the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have received since their unveiling. You can read all about them here.</p>
