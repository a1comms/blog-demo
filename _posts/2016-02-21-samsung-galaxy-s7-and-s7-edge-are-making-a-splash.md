<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge unite everything we loved about the Galaxy S5 &ndash; its water-resistant rating and expandable storage &ndash; with the market-leading design of the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, along with some much-welcomed upgrades.</span></p>
<p>The latest members of the Galaxy family are here, unveiled Sunday evening by Samsung during its &ldquo;Unpacked&rdquo; event in Barcelona. They are the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-gold">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> and the larger, curved Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.</p>
<p>They succeed the wildly popular Galaxy S6 and S6 edge as the new flagships in Samsung&rsquo;s increasingly fearsome range of smartphones, and early impressions suggest they could be set for even greater triumph in the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8727" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/CbwgfsoWEAAh6Gg.jpg" alt="curved Samsung Galaxy S7 edge." width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>To me, what makes Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge so exciting is that they&rsquo;ve borrowed innovation from previous best-selling Galaxy S mobile phones, and rolled them into one all-singing, all-dancing device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8728" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/CbwgPmdW8AIEcAx.jpg" alt="larger, curved Samsung Galaxy S7 edge." width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking specifically about the durable, water-resistant design on Samsung Galaxy S5, as well as its microSD card slot for expanding storage (now up to 200GB). The arrival of the metallic Galaxy S6 saw these loved features quietly vanish; however, the announcement of the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge have brought them back into the picture.</p>

<p>But rather than compromising on the quality of the design in order to do so, Samsung created a robust, water and dust-resistant build that shares the same premium looks and materials as the beautiful Galaxy S6. So you get to have your cake and eat it, too. Nom nom nom.</p>
<p>The camera performance has been vastly improved, now that it features a Dual Pixel 12MP unit. It takes two photos at once and blends them together to create a richer looking result. A larger lens (F1.7) and larger pixel image sensor (1.4um) also mean that your photos are brighter than previous Samsung Galaxy smartphones, even if the light conditions are less than ideal.</p>

<p>Both Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge have been equipped with upgraded batteries. The Galaxy S7 edge houses a larger 3600mAh cell, to feed its hungrier 5.5-inch Quad HD display. And the smaller 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 features a 3000mAh battery. Both are much quicker to charge from flat to full, and support inductive charging (wireless chargers sold separately&hellip; sad times).</p>

<p>Another exciting new feature is the pioneering Always-On Display (AOD) that keeps useful information available at a glance, even when the screen is idle, and uses less than 1% of the battery life per hour. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the new Game Launcher feature, which brings all of your games together in one place and also gives you recommendations on what you can play next.</p>
<p>This is really just a whistle-stop introduction to the newly announced Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, to whet your appetite before we bring you more particulars and a full review. You can already pre-order both devices, and get yourself to the front of the release queue. We&rsquo;ll bring your more details on availability dates soon.</p>
