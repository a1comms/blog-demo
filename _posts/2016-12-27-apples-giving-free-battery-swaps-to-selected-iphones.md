<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Because some things in life <em>are </em>free.</span></p>
<p>Apple's iPhone 6s is a fantastic mobile phone. It was the first to introduce 3D Touch - a new, quicker way to interact with apps. And it also debuted Live Photos - the feature that brings your photos to life, by turning them into short videos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, the experience for some iPhone 6s users may have not quite lived up to expectation. That's because Apple recently identified a battery endurance issue that affected 'a very small number' of devices made between September and October of 2015.</p>
<p>Apple is accepting total responsibility for the manufacturing hiccup, and is offering to remedy it by replacing batteries in affected iPhone 6s units. Hurrah!</p>
<p>FYI, the battery issue is related to battery<em> life</em>, not a risk around it suddenly bursting into flames. So rest assured.</p>
<h2>Is Your iPhone 6s Affected?</h2>
<p>If you suspect that your device is from the faulty batch, there&rsquo;s a simple way to find out. First of all, find your serial number by going to <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> General </strong>><strong> About</strong>. There, you'll see it in the list of phone information.</p>
<p>Next, head over to Apple&rsquo;s support page where you can enter your serial number, running a check on whether you're eligible for a free battery replacement.</p>
<p>If the results come back negative, your iPhone 6s is absolutely fine! Remember, it's only a very small numbers that are affected&hellip;</p>
<p>If yours is, though, contact Apple Support or, alternatively, visit an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Store</a>.</p>
<p>Before you hand your phone in, though, Apple recommends you backup your data to iTunes or iCloud, and switch off Find My iPhone. In addition, you should wipe your iPhone by at <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> General </strong>><strong> Reset </strong>><strong> Erase all Content and Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>With the above completed, Apple will fit a new battery into your iPhone 6s for free. You'll no doubt notice a boosted battery life once you're back up and running.</p>
