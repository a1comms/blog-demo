<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new iPhone 6s rumour has popped up online, purporting to list the key features of this year&rsquo;s new, fabled iPhone.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6739" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/11006441_972351109442615_6040865970447834929_n.jpg" alt="iPhone 6" width="500" height="684" /></p>
<p>Well folks, it&rsquo;s that time again. It&rsquo;s been roughly nine months since iPhone 6 was unveiled, alongside its jumbo sibling iPhone 6 Plus, so it must be time for rumours to start popping up online about its upcoming successor.</p>
<p>It just so happens that while we have already seen the odd rumour here and there, this week has seen a whopper of a rumour hit the net. It&rsquo;s being reported on by AppleInsider, it comes in the form of a research note issued by Ming-Chi Kuo of analysts KGI Securities (who, we have to note, has an excellent track record with iPhone rumours), and it lays out pretty much everything we can expect from the new phone, dubbed iPhone 6s.</p>
<h2>Rose gold body</h2>
<p>The first notable thing in the research note is that we may well be seeing a new finish on iPhone 6s. Specifically, it&rsquo;s said to be a rose gold finish, one that will complement that&nbsp;on the top-end luxury version of the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely clear whether it will be an <em>actual</em> 18-karat gold varnish (as on the Watch, which costs upwards of $10,000), or whether it will just <em>look</em> like Apple Watch, but either way, it seems likely that we&rsquo;ll see a new look joining the iPhone line-up.</p>
<h2>Two new iPhones?&nbsp;Or&nbsp;three?</h2>
<p>One of the most intriguing rumours so far has been the idea that 2015 will see the launch of three new iPhones at once, with the 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions being joined by a smaller, more pocket-friendly version with a 4-inch screen. This variant is being dubbed as iPhone Air.</p>
<p>However, if the&nbsp;research note in question is accurate, we'll be treated to just&nbsp;a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch iPhone this autumn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possibly that Apple could still surprise us by launching a new 4-inch variant, but at this stage, it&rsquo;s starting to look like people who wanted that smaller iPhone may be left disappointed. That being said, some are claiming that iPhone Air may be introduced next year...</p>
<h2>More RAM and a new processor</h2>
<p>One <em>really</em> important new addition, if the report is indeed accurate, is a nice hefty dollop of extra RAM in its new A9 processor. Specifically, iPhone 6s will reportedly have double the RAM of last year&rsquo;s model (thus taking it up to 2GB). The relevant equation is simple: <em>more RAM = faster phone = sleeker, nicer user experience</em>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d call that a very good thing indeed!</p>
<h2>A bigger, better camera</h2>
<p>Both of last year&rsquo;s iPhones came with an 8MP iSight camera, and pun-laden name notwithstanding, it <em>was </em>a rather brilliant camera, and it had a load of extra features that all served to improve the basic mission: to take really, <em>really</em> nice photos.</p>
<p>With iPhone 6s, we can expect all those extra features to return, naturally. <em>This</em> time, however, they&rsquo;re rumoured to be joined by a brand new 12MP sensor (up from the 8MP in iPhone 6), so your photos are going to look even sharper!</p>
<h2>Clever new stuff going on with the screen</h2>
<p>Perhaps most exciting of all, however, is a new feature that&rsquo;s rumoured to be built into the screen, namely something called Force Touch.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_6740" align="aligncenter" width="602"]<img class="wp-image-6740 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Force-Touch.png" alt="Force Touch" width="602" height="384" /> Force Touch on Apple's new MacBook. The trackpad uses a 'diving board' mechanism to detect how much pressure you're applying.[/caption]</p>
<p>This is not, as you might think, a <em>Star Wars</em> movie that George Lucas prefers not to talk about; rather, it&rsquo;s what happens when Apple builds a pressure sensor into the screen, much like it&nbsp;did on the Apple Watch, and into the trackpad on the new MacBook.</p>
<p>That pressure sensor will allow the phone to differentiate between light touches and hard presses, allowing a much greater range of gesture controls (and, for instance, the option of handwritten signatures).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how this feature will pan out, or what new options it will bring to the table, but of everything listed in the research note, this is by far the most intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It remains to be seen&rdquo; is pretty much the watchword here. Everything in this list is, after all, rumour, but if it does come to fruition, then iPhone 6s could be something very special indeed. </strong></p>
