<p><span class="postStandFirst">BlackBerry Leap &ndash; the smartphone to revive the once ubiquitous manufacturer, or just a leap of faith?</span></p>

<p>The skinny jeans generation of today may struggle to get their head around this, but there was once a time when <em>not</em> owning a BlackBerry, was considered about as cool as a conflab in Klingon&hellip; whilst wearing Crocs.</p>
<p>Sadly, however, those days have been and gone. BlackBerry is no longer the driving force that it used to be, though it is still producing some quality mobile phones.</p>
<p>The most recent of which appears to be targeting young and uncommonly attractive professionals. Going by the graphic above, at least.</p>
<p>Named BlackBerry Leap, this handset slots itself into the competitive mid-range market, and may contend with the likes of Sony Xperia T3 and Samsung Galaxy A5. Although BB Leap is priced lower than both.</p>
<p>It looks considerably more attractive than BlackBerry&rsquo;s past touchscreen phones, like the Z30 and Z10, dressed in a more modern design.</p>
<p>BB Leap features a glossy-looking 5-inch HD (720p) display, in addition to a 1.5GHz Qualcomm processor and 2GB RAM.</p>
<p>It packs an 8-megapixel camera with auto-focus and 1080p video recording, as well as a 2-megapixel camera for the occasional &lsquo;cheeky selfie&rsquo; and video call.</p>
<p>And, get this: BlackBerry is stating that Leap&rsquo;s 2800mAh battery will give users 25 hours of &lsquo;heavy use&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s pretty difficult to quantify just how heavy &lsquo;heavy use&rsquo; is, but it sounds promising regardless.</p>
<p>All-in-all, early impressions of BlackBerry Leap are very positive. It&rsquo;s a good-looking mobile with decent mid-range specs, and it&rsquo;s priced very modestly.</p>
<p><strong>But will it set the industry alight, and propel BlackBerry back into the minds, hands and pockets of you and all your friends, like days gone by? Probably not.</strong></p>
