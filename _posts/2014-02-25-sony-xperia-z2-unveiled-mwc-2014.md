<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Sony Xperia Z1 was easily one of the best smartphones of 2013, and now, at MWC 2014, we&rsquo;ve seen what could well be one of the best smartphones of 2014; the Sony Xperia Z2 has gone official!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-5866 aligncenter" alt="MWC 2014" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/mwc-barcelona-03-1024x464.jpg" width="960" height="435" /></p>
<p>It turns out that it&rsquo;s not going to be alone on store shelves, either, because Sony also unveiled two&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;devices, in addition to their awesome new 2014 flagship. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all three, beginning with that new superphone; the first point to note is that while it&rsquo;s not a huge quantum leap over last year&rsquo;s Xperia flagship, the Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>still a newer, better phone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is the new technology used in the screen; the screen size has been upped to 5.2-inches, and it includes 'Live Color LED' technology to make it look&nbsp;<em>extra</em>-sumptuous. It also comes with stereo speakers, similarly to the HTC One, and of course, the whole thing is packaged in a waterproof body.</p>
<p>In short, the Sony Xperia Z2 looks to be a&nbsp;<em>stunning</em>&nbsp;phone!</p>
<p>Sharing the &lsquo;Z&rsquo; classification is the new Sony Xperia Z1 Tablet, which features the same internals as the Z2 smartphone, but which has had the girth of its body shrunk down to a mere 6.4mm. It is, quite simply, the thinnest and lightest waterproof tablet ever.</p>
<p>Finally, we have possibly the most interesting of the three, the mid-range Sony Xperia M2. Its specifications are&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;similar to the fantastic Moto G, so if Sony can get the pricing right, Motorola may have just gained a&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;threatening competitor for dominance of the mid-range.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no concrete release date for these devices as yet, but rumours suggest they will be available in April; keep watching this space for more information!&nbsp;</strong></p>
