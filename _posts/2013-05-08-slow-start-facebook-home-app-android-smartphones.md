<p><span class="postStandFirst">Facebook Home is the new social media app for Android smartphones that replaces apps on user&rsquo;s screens with Facebook friends and status updates. It has so far seen a poor uptake of downloads since its launch. The latest mobile innovation from Facebook was unveiled by the firm&rsquo;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg on 4 April. But since the new app&rsquo;s launch on the Google Play app store on 12 April, it has been downloaded just 500,000 times.</span></p>
<p>The poor start for Facebook Home comes amid somewhat varied reviews of the app, and a rating of just two stars on the Google Play app store. Half-a-million downloads in less than two weeks is impressive by some standards, but not by those which the likes of Facebook operate on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7354/8720901230_4c74a99205_m.jpg" width="225" height="225" />Instagram, the photo-sharing service bought by Facebook last year, racked up a whopping 5 million downloads in just six days when it was released on the Google Play store. And Facebook&rsquo;s active user total of more than 1 billion means that just 0.5% of the social network&rsquo;s users have downloaded Facebook Home.</p>
<p>Of course, the circumstances surrounding Facebook Home&rsquo;s launch means that it was never going to see the sort of download numbers that a service like Instagram had. For starts, the app is only available on a limited number of Android handsets at the moment, namely the Samsung Galaxy S3, the Galaxy Note 2, the HTC One X, the One X+, and the yet-to-be-released Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the fact that Facebook Home&rsquo;s launch has been staggered around the world, with the UK launch date a few days later on 16 April. Download numbers are likely to pick up as the app becomes available on more handsets, but it&rsquo;s an embarrassing start nonetheless for a service that had so much hype at its launch.</p>
<p>At the launch, Facebook said: &ldquo;Home isn't a phone or operating system, and it's also more than just an app. Home is a completely new experience that lets you see the world through people, not apps.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Facebook Home: How it Works</strong></h2>
<p>By effectively &lsquo;wrapping&rsquo; your phone&rsquo;s home screen in Facebook, it creates an always-on app that gives you instant updates and photo uploads from friends, as well as integrating text messages with the Facebook chat function.</p>
<p>Key features include improved notifications and Cover Feed, which replaces your phone&rsquo;s home screen and lock screen with a constant stream of activity from Facebook. There&rsquo;s also Chat Heads, a revamping of the instant messaging service which allows users to chat with friends without the need to go into a new application.</p>
<p>Initial reviews of Facebook Home praised its speed and improved functionality, but critics queried why smartphone users would want constant access to the social network. Reviews from users on Google Play reflected this, with one saying: &ldquo;There are some really neat features, but I feel like it's too in your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another user said: &ldquo;I tried it, and to be honest, it just was too much. I would like it better if it was just the lock screen, but it gets annoying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were also claims that the always-on app was draining batteries. Download numbers are likely to improve as the app becomes more widely available, but initial forecasts do not look good for Facebook Home.</p>
