<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Get the latest update now!</span></p>
<p>If you're a loyal Apple customer, you no doubt have the Apple Store app installed on your iPhone. If that's you, we have some good news: the good folk at Apple just gave it a little makeover&hellip; and you might want to check it out for yourself.</p>
<h2>Apple Store App: New Voice Search Feature</h2>
<p>The latest update to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Store for iOS (version 5.1) app</a> is available now and adds a new level of simplicity to finding what you need. Say hello to voice search.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve updated the app, you can start using your microphone to search for specific products. Simply tap the microphone symbol in the app and say the name of the thing you need.</p>

<h2>Apple Store App: Redesigned Search Bar</h2>
<p>The search bar on this latest version of the app may appear a little familiar to you. There&rsquo;s a great reason for that. You may have seen it before. The bar has been featured on the App Store and the iTunes Store before now. That means that it&rsquo;s been tried and tested already and proved to be seriously useful.</p>
<p>The redesigned version of the bar shows trending topics, which could help you to figure out just what you&rsquo;re looking for. But, by far the most exciting new feature of the app is the voice search. The fact that you can just tap a button and say what you need is certain to make the entire experience much easier than it would otherwise be.</p>

<h2>Apple Store App: Smarter Searching</h2>
<p>The smart search goes deeper than that. In fact, you can ask the app for specific things like hardware that will work with your device. It should consider which device you&rsquo;re using (i.e. what iPhone you have!) when returning your results to you. For example, if you&rsquo;re using an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone 8</a> for your query, you should only get results that fit that device.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also get the latest information when it comes to things like <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/iphone-9-rumours-and-release-date-heres-what-weve-heard-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the next iPhone will be released</a>. Basically, if you have any Apple related queries or just want to find yourself some brand new tech, the fresh and improved Apple Store app is a great place to start.</p>
