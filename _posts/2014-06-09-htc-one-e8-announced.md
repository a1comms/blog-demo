<p><span class="postStandFirst">After months of rumours, the HTC One M8 Ace has been unveiled, under the official name of HTC One E8. With very similar internal specs to the HTC One M8 (but with a plastic body instead of metal, and a single-lens 13MP camera), the HTC One E8 is designed to be a more budget-friendly version of HTC&rsquo;s uber-powerful flagship.</span></p>

<p>With a heady combination of a gorgeous metal body, a lightning-fast processor and a camera unlike any other on the market, the HTC One M8 is easily one of the most exciting phones of 2014. And now, there&rsquo;s a new, budget-friendlier version of the phone...</p>

<p>For a long time, it was rumoured to be the HTC One M8 Ace, but now that HTC has finally unveiled the phone, we get to see it under its real name, in all its polycarbonate glory.</p>
<p>Say hello to the HTC One E8!</p>
<p>Looking at the phone, you can see that the design is very clearly modelled on the flagship HTC One M8, with the same 5-inch 1080p screen and the same awesome BoomSound speakers. It&rsquo;s also similar on the inside, too, as the HTC One E8 uses the Snapdragon 801 processor as the One M8 (and the same as other flagships like the Sony Xperia Z2 or the newly announced LG G3), and 2GB of RAM.</p>
<p>There are a few differences, of course, as the HTC One E8 is designed to be more budget-friendly. The two most obvious ones are that the metal body has been replaced by polycarbonate plastic, and the unique Duo Camera has been excised, replaced by a standard 13MP shooter. While the latter <em>is</em> a shame, it&rsquo;s not surprising in a phone aimed at a lower price point, although we are surprised that HTC didn&rsquo;t go with a single-lens UltraPixel camera as many people expected.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no firm release date for the HTC One E8 in territories other than China (where it will be launched soon), but we&rsquo;ll watching this one closely, so stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
