<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Android, iOS or Windows - which is the best for mobile gaming?</span></p>
<p><u></u>It&rsquo;s amazing how advanced mobile phones have become, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the mobile gaming arena. Seriously, how many of us (those of us who were around during the early days of mobile) thought that we&rsquo;d be playing the kind of games we have today?</p>
<p>Yes, this author remembers being impressed by the <em>Men In Black</em> rails-shooter on the Sony Ericsson P800, and saying it would never get any better than that. I may have been slightly wrong on that score...</p>
<p>But the question is: when it comes to mobile gaming, which mobile platform is best? If you&rsquo;re into your gaming, should you go for iOS, Android or Windows?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>There are <em>so many</em> games to play on smartphones right now, and as a result, it&rsquo;s impossible to pick out a winner based on what games are available.</p>
<p>Now granted, you&rsquo;ve platform-exclusives making it a <em>little</em> easier to pick (iOS has <em>Infinity Blade</em>, for instance, while Windows phones have <em>HALO: Spartan Assault</em>), but in general terms, most mobile games are available on all three platforms.</p>
<p>And thus, it&rsquo;s a dead heat; there&rsquo;s no outright winner in this category, so we need to move on to other gaming features to try and find a winner...</p>

<h2><strong>Community</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be able to pick a winner based around the gaming <em>community</em> each platform offers (and when we say &ldquo;community&rdquo;, we mean Xbox Live on Windows phones, Games Center on iOS, and Google Play Games on Android).</p>
<p>Even when we do that, however, it&rsquo;s still difficult to pick an outright winner, because all three communities offer <em>basically</em> the same experience. All three are equally brilliant, so alas, we can&rsquo;t use this category to pick a winner, either.</p>
<p>In that case, it&rsquo;s time to wheel out the secret weapons, because in this arena, one platform is clearly superior...</p>
<h2><strong>Secret Weapons...</strong></h2>
<p>That platform is Android, and it has two extras that the other platforms cannot match (yet). The first is the Humble Bundle, the now-famous games bundle that periodically lets you buy a bundle of games <em>for whatever price you want</em> (even zero, if you&rsquo;re spectacularly tight).</p>
<p>Humble Bundles offer insanely good value for money, and they&rsquo;re only available on Android phones.</p>
<p>The other secret weapon is Nvidia SHIELD, a series of tablets and set-top boxes that run on Android, and allow you to stream games from your PC (if you&rsquo;re using an Nvidia graphics card).</p>
<p>So, basically, you can use your mobile phone to play <em>non-mobile</em> PC games; we&rsquo;re talking games like <em>Fallout 4</em>, <em>Just Cause 3</em>, and <em>The Division</em>, as impossible as that sounds.</p>

<p><strong>The formula in this situation is simple: <em>PC games > mobile games</em>. And as such, Android romps home as the single greatest platform for mobile games! </strong></p>
