<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The ultimate battle of the phablets</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, a mere standard smartphone is just not good enough. Oh no, you want something bigger, better, and far more powerful. That&rsquo;s where phablets take centre stage. These mammoth versions of flagship phones pack more punch than you can imagine and they just so happen to look pretty darn awesome to boot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering supersizing your next device, we hear you! There&rsquo;s a whole load of reasons that a phablet may just be the right choice for you. With that in mind, we decided to pit two of the most popular &lsquo;Plus&rsquo; phones against each other in a battle of stunning technology. So, which phone is right for you?</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus are very different phones. There&rsquo;s just no way that you could mistake them for one another as their design style is completely alien to one another. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s tackle the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. There&rsquo;s a hefty metal frame here, but the entire front and back of the device is coated in glass. What&rsquo;s more, the edge-to-edge screen means that the front of the device has an almost bezeless look. It&rsquo;s a little thicker than the iPhone, too, but still looks relatively sleek and smart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus is a little more streamlined. The metal unibody has no glass casing and looks razor thin by comparison. However, there are bezels both above and below the screen which means that the style of the phone looks less &lsquo;space aged&rsquo; than its counterpart. It has also kept the home button (which is actually a fingerprint sensor), whereas the Samsung has not.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about what really matters here &mdash; size. A phablet just isn&rsquo;t a phablet unless it&rsquo;s a sheer monster of a phone; one that marks the middle ground between smartphone and tablet. Surprisingly, there is very little difference here. The iPhone 7 Plus comes in at &nbsp;158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm while the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is 159 x 74 x 8mm. You will hardly notice the difference in phone size at all.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>When it comes to screen size, however, there&rsquo;s a really noticeable difference. The Galaxy S8 Plus boasts a 6.2-inch screen, which really is one of its major selling points right now. That&rsquo;s a whole load of screen for your money! The iPhone 7 Plus&rsquo; screen is almost an inch smaller at 5.5 inches. Eek.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the Galaxy S8 Plus also has better resolution and a sharper screen. The display comes in at 1,440 x 2,960, which means that you&rsquo;re getting a seriously crisp, bright look whenever you decide to use this phone. The fact that the screen is larger than that of the iPhone makes no difference since Samsung has upped their game in this area.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, that&rsquo;s not to say that the iPhone 7 Plus has a poor quality screen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The phablet has a 1080 x 1920 display resolution, which is actually quite respectable when you compare it to modern phones on the market. Sadly, it&rsquo;s just not enough to take on the likes of the Samsung.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>When it comes to the power of each of these phones, there&rsquo;s little to no difference here. The iPhone 7 Plus uses the well-known Apple A10 Fusion chipset and packs a steady 3GB of RAM. Put simply, that means that you should have absolutely no problem when it comes to using this phone and how quickly it happens to work. The Samsung uses an octa-core chipset with a slightly larger 4GB of RAM. There&rsquo;s not much between these two devices here.</p>
<p>Of course, the two operating systems that these phablets use are quite different. The iPhone 7 Plus, of course, uses iOS 10. Apple users will find this system appealing as it&rsquo;s familiar and one of the easiest to use on the market. The uncluttered interface and clean look means that it&rsquo;s a breeze. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus uses Android Nougat; the OS is a little more customizable and includes features such as &lsquo;app drawers&rsquo; to hide apps away. Which you choose here is honestly down to personal preference.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>In reality, there are many similarities when it comes to the features that these two phablets have. The Samsung and the iPhone both offer a fingerprint sensor &mdash; though the S8&rsquo;s sensor is on the back of the device and the iPhone&rsquo;s is on the home button. Plus, with the release of Bixby (Samsung&rsquo;s AI), both of these phones now have a dedicated AI system built into them. That means that a personal assistant comes as standard on either device. Each phone is also somewhat waterproof, which is a major draw these days too.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus offers a few added extras that the iPhone just doesn&rsquo;t. For example, it has an iris scanner, which will increase security no end, and offers wireless charging. The device has also kept the much-loved headphone jack, which (as we all well know) Apple has now done away with completely.</p>
<p>Despite all of the above, the iPhone is still a great option for tech lovers. One of the main advantages for those who have other Apple products is the fact that all of your gadgets can work seamlessly in sync. This is an area where Apple really does excel.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a true phablet, i.e. a phone which can double as a tablet when needed, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is likely the right choice for you. Everything from the massive screen-size and bezeless design to the top-notch resolution here makes this smartphone ahead of the game. It&rsquo;s sure to be a real winner.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, there is still an unspeakable draw that the iPhone will always have over some of us. The simplicity of the design and the interface means that the phone is always easy and instinctive to use. That is something that appeals to many Apple fans out there. What&rsquo;s more, the screen is more manageable and can likely be used with just one hand. Bonus.</p>
<p>Needless to say, both of these devices are leaders in the wide world of phablets. It&rsquo;s well worth checking out each phone for yourself before you make your decision. No matter which you choose, you can be certain that you&rsquo;ll get a whole load of phone for your money!</p>
