<p><span class="postStandFirst">It's finally here! The Samsung Galaxy S4 recently hit terra firma, and boy, what a device it is!</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S4&nbsp;is one outstanding device combining some of the most powerful hardware on the market with some of the most interactive features ever seen on a smartphone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The look of the device is more of an evolution of the Samsung Galaxy S3 rather than a revolutionary new design, but what is impressive is the fact that the Galaxy S4 is thinner than its predecessor, whilst housing a bigger display and a larger battery. The edges of the handset have a metallic bezel and the device is made from a polycarbonate body with a hyper-glaze finish, giving the both a light and durable frame.</p>

<p>The display of the device has taken a step forward too. The latest Galaxy now sports a 5 inch full HD AMOLED screen which displays rich colours, clear text and movies which look astonishingly life-like.</p>
<p>Powering the device is a speedy 1.9GHz quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM, a combination which means the Galaxy S4 can power through numerous tasks without breaking a sweat and can run the latest HD games or movies with ease.</p>
<p>On the back of the device is a monstrous 13 megapixel camera with some fantastic imaging functions installed. Samsung has included innovative new features in the form of dual-shot mode, this benig the ability to take a picture with both cameras at the same time, and Panorama Shot which allows for sweeping pictures of objects.</p>
<p>As ever, the Korean manufacturer's TouchWiz user interface is firmly on-board sitting over the latest version of Android Jelly Bean 4.2. Taking the smart features that were first debuted on the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2, Samsung has now included Smart Scroll, the ability to browse web pages simply by looking up and down the page; Smart Pause, which pauses video when the user looks away from the screen, and Air Gestures, a function which allows you to control your gallery by a simple wave of your hand and no physical contact with the smartphone.</p>
<p>The handset has 4G LTE connectivity, Near Field Communication, a huge 2600mah removable battery and the ability to expand the memory up to 64GB using a microSD card.</p>
<p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a superb smartphone offering a great balance of power and performance, coupled with some of the most interesting software features currently on the market. As expected, the device is of premium quality and is right up there with the mighty HTC One and Sony Xperia Z, making it a definite contender for smartphone of the year!</strong></p>
