<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The Harry Potter world will come to life thanks to augmented reality.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever lay awake at night, pondering why your Hogwarts letter never arrived, we have some exciting news. While you won't be able to attend the actual school, you&rsquo;ll soon be able to whip out your mobile and experience what it feels like to be a witch or wizard.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a rather magical mobile game in the works. Called <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em>, this new game is being developed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Niantic Inc. The latter just so happens to be the masterminds behind the whirlwind success that was Pok&eacute;mon GO. While there&rsquo;s no official release date yet, we do know a thing or two about how the app will work.</p>

<p>According to an official statement on <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/news/new-augmented-reality-mobile-game-harry-potter-wizards-unite-announced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottermore</a>, the &ldquo;state-of-the-art augmented reality technology on smartphones, so a player can view the real world through a wizarding world lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much like Pok&eacute;mon GO, this augmented reality Harry Potter game will allow users to interact with the real world and computer-generated features in sync. So, for example, you may be walking down your road and bump into a character from the magical franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s much more to it than simply wandering around trying to spot familiar faces along the way. The aim of the game will reportedly be to build up an &lsquo;illustrious wizarding career&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll do that by casting spells, finding mysterious artefacts, and taking part in magical adventures. It&rsquo;s basically a dream-come-true for any Harry Potter fans out there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this game, we are allowing the passionate, worldwide fan base to explore J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s deeply powerful and imaginative universe in a new, truly immersive way,&rdquo; explains David Haddad, President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to have Niantic&rsquo;s remarkable augmented reality expertise as we develop this incredibly rich wizarding world for players to explore in their everyday lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s pretty hush-hush at the moment, but you can follow the game&rsquo;s progress on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HPWizardsUnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HPWizardsUnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, as well as checking its official site <a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> too. Neat, huh?</p>
