<p><span class="postStandFirst">On launch-day the Samsung Galaxy S5 outsold the Galaxy S4 by 30% in Korea, and saw more than double the sales of last year&rsquo;s flagship in some European markets. It&rsquo;s also going out of stock in many places, but we still have it available, so grab one quick, before they&rsquo;re all snapped up!</span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5?adnetwork=fcbk">Samsung Galaxy S5</a> has been grabbing headlines left, right and centre, thanks to being a truly awesome phone. We now know that it&rsquo;s been grabbing <em>sales</em> left, right and centre, as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Samsung Galaxy S5" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2856/13776141263_2c8ee16fd6_o.jpg" width="325" height="235" /></p>
<p>According to GSMArena, the launch days sales of the Samsung Galaxy S5 were truly massive, and they in fact broke the record set by the Samsung Galaxy S4, <em>by a full 30%</em>!</p>
<p>However, we should also note that those sales figures are, as far as we can work out, <em>only </em>for Korea, and that the world is a big place. Thus, we would expect the launch-day sales figures for the Samsung Galaxy S5 to have been different in other countries, and in fact, they have been.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been even <em>bigger</em>...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/13776477014_c379f5303c.jpg" width="500" height="119" /></p>
<p>In some European markets, the launch-day sales of the Galaxy S5 were more than <em>twice</em> those of the Galaxy S4! This result is certainly going to give Samsung a big lead over rivals like the HTC One M8 and the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/sony?adnetwork=fcbk">Sony Xperia Z2</a>, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>By any metric, therefore, it&rsquo;s fair to say that the Samsung Galaxy S5 has been a <em>colossal</em> success, but the most mind-blowing part is that sales could have been even higher if some retailers hadn&rsquo;t run out of stock. The mere fact that the only thing stopping the Galaxy S5 achieving even higher sales figures was retailers not having enough in stock is one serious indicator of how massive demand is for this phone.</p>
<p><strong>But never fear! If you&rsquo;ve been trying to get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy S5, but can&rsquo;t find it anywhere, <em>we still have it in stock.</em> So grab yours now, because this beauty is selling like hotcakes, and you really don&rsquo;t want to miss out! </strong></p>
