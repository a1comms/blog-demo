<p>The chemical-free wash developed by PaqTech, and aptly named Fresh Cycle, is a revolutionary system to deodorize, sanitise and kill bacteria, all inside a bag!</p>
<p>You can put your PaqSule on a 25-minute cycle, or longer, where it will refresh your clothing using oxygen and UV-C light, killing germs and leaving it odour free. So, waft goodbye to the smell when next opening your gym bag. Ahh, bliss.</p>

<p>The smart bag also comes with an internal and removable zip-off (which could be used as a wash bag for instance), an ideal shower caddy for gym users. There's also a compartment to conveniently place in your footwear, and several other compartments perfect to house your tech and other gym gear.</p>

You can recharge the built-in power battery too, so your always ready to take on the day with plenty of power in the bank. Giving you guaranteed phone use for longer, by literally having a phone charger in your hands.</p>
