<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Things are getting seriously bitter between Google and Amazon.</span></p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, Google has made the decision to remove YouTube from the Fire TV and Echo Show platforms. That means that those of us using Amazon devices will no longer be able to watch hilarious cat videos using the app. What?!</p>
<p>The decision is a result of a bitter feud between Google and Amazon; but these latest moves will certainly affect customers more than anyone else out there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website,&rdquo; a spokesperson for Amazon recently told The Verge. &ldquo;We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, what on earth caused Google to make this decision? Well, it&rsquo;s actually a case of tit-for-tat. For a long time, Amazon has refused to sell Chromecasts, or support Google Cast on their products. Plus, it didn&rsquo;t help when Amazon also delisted Google&rsquo;s Nest products, including Nest Secure and the E Thermostat.</p>
<p>In response to these (let&rsquo;s be honest here) <em>petty</em> moves, Google has decided to stop Fire TV customers from enjoying videos on YouTube. That means, assuming there&rsquo;s no change in the next month, millions of customers will no longer be able to use the app on their device. Since YouTube is such an essential part of entertainment these days, it really is a huge blow to viewers.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">So Google's feud with Amazon just reached my living room. Got this screen when I launched YouTube on my Amazon Fire TV. <a href="https://t.co/vtmcuBTtE9">pic.twitter.com/vtmcuBTtE9</a></p>

<p>Customers will be able to use a standard desktop version of YouTube on both Amazon products. Though, the clunkier display won&rsquo;t be ideal. &ldquo;Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube&rsquo;s existing website,&rdquo; said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Of course, the forces behind Google are not saying that this move is part of the feud. Instead, it&rsquo;s understood that, since Amazon overlays its own voice controls on the app, this violates one of YouTube&rsquo;s terms, which says &ldquo;you agree not to alter or modify any part of the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless, taking YouTube away from Amazon devices is sure to have an impact. And that&rsquo;s the point. However, in punishing Amazon, Google has also ended up punishing customers who use both platforms and expect their gadgets to be able to support all apps.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the Echo Show will be losing the YouTube app immediately, whereas the Fire TV will no longer have it as of 1st January 2018. Happy new year, guys!</p>
