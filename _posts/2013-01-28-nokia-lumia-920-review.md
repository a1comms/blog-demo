<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new breed of Windows Phone!</span></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 10px;" alt="" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/nokia_lumia_920_black_tmb.jpg" width="71" height="135" /></strong>With the release of their Windows Phone OS, Microsoft entered a market that was dominated by two major players, Android (as seen on the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S3, amongst others) and iOS (as seen on the&nbsp;iPhone 5). Some people wondered how Windows Phone could compete against such powerful competition, but now, we know exactly what will allow Windows Phone to succeed.</p>
<p>Quite simply, the answer is amazing phones like the&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p>The first striking thing about the Nokia Lumia 920 is its incredible build quality; a with a gorgeous polycarbonate body, and a curved glass screen, the Nokia Lumia 920 is a thing of beauty, no matter which colour you buy.</p>
<p>As well as having a curved glass fascia, the Nokia Lumia 920 also uses a 720p PureMotionHD+ screen, which measures 4.5 inches, corner to corner, and which is so sensitive that you can even comfortably use the phone while wearing gloves. That is a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;rare feature indeed (in fact, no other phones come to mind as using it at all), and it just makes the Nokia Lumia 920 even more unique. The same can be said of the camera, too, because it uses pioneering new low light technology; put simply, the Nokia Lumia 920&nbsp;<em>cannot</em>&nbsp;be beaten, if you want to take photos in low light, on your phone.</p>
<p>Tying all of this together is the phone&rsquo;s interface, and as is now well known, the Nokia Lumia 920 uses the newest, best version of Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile OS, Windows Phone 8. This has been developed around the same kernel as Windows 8 for PCs and tablets, and as such, it is considerably more powerful than its predecessor. In addition, the Start screen has been remodelled, to stretch the Live Tiles across the entire front of the screen, making it look more symmetrical, and thus, Windows Phone 8 is&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;more visually appealing than its predecessor, as well.</p>
<p>One of the most striking aspects of Windows Phone, though, has always been how fast and responsive it is, and in the Nokia Lumia 920, this speed is even more apparent, thanks to the fact that Windows Phone 8 now supports multi-core processors. The Lumia 920 takes advantage of this, and uses a dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, clocked to 1.5GHz. Coupled with the already responsive nature of Windows Phone, this means that the Nokia Lumia 920 is an absolute&nbsp;<em>dream</em>&nbsp;to use; it&rsquo;s incredibly fast, superbly smooth, and so responsive that it almost pre-empts what you want to do with it!</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, the Nokia Lumia 920 is a&nbsp;<em>superb</em>&nbsp;phone. There is a word often bandied about to describe top-end flagship devices, and that word is &ldquo;superphone&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s used to describe handsets such as the&nbsp;LG Nexus 4, or the Samsung Galaxy S3, and it&rsquo;s a term that connotes that these phones are, basically, the best of the best.</p>
<p><strong>The Nokia Lumia 920 stands shoulder to shoulder with those giants, because it is, without a doubt,&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;definitive Windows superphone!</strong></p>
