<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Say hello to iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED.</span></p>
<p>Are <em>you </em>thinking of upgrading to an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus? Because now could be the perfect time! Apple just announced a special edition of the two flagship handsets, and you&rsquo;re not going to want to miss out on them. This time, Apple fans will be seeing&hellip;. Red!</p>
<p>Sporting an eye-catching finish, the (PRODUCT)RED version of iPhone 8 is now available to pre-order from Buymobiles.net. As though the snazzy new colour wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you excited, there&rsquo;s also the fact that this special edition of the iPhone supports a very worthy cause.</p>
<p>Yes, a portion of the proceeds from (PRODUCT)RED devices will go towards Global Fund HIV/AIDS grants. That means that the money will help fund treatment and prevention programmes, as well as counselling and testing. Nice work, Apple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement is further evidence of Apple&rsquo;s leadership in and commitment to the AIDS fight since the beginning of (RED) in 2006,&rdquo; said Deborah Dugan, (RED)&rsquo;s CEO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more than $160 million Apple has donated in the last 11 years today equates to more than 800 million days of lifesaving ARV medication that prevents the transmission of HIV from mothers to their babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honoured that Apple has dedicated its resources to our purpose, and can&rsquo;t wait to see customers bring our mission to life through the purchase of iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s still more exciting news. Should you already have an iPhone X, you can still get a cheeky slice of the action. Apple will also be releasing a (PRODUCT)RED folio made from tanned and finished European leather. Likewise, some of the proceeds from the gorgeous new accessory will be donated to Global Fund. Plus, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to support (RED) with this bold new iPhone and hope customers think it is as special as we do.&rdquo; said Greg Joswiak, Apple&rsquo;s Vice President of Product Marketing, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2018/04/apple-introduces-iphone-8-and-iphone-8-plus-productred-special-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> from the company.</p>
<p>So, when can you get your hands on the special edition models of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus? They&rsquo;re available to pre-order today, with the devices shipping for delivery on Friday 13 April. Lucky for some!</p>
