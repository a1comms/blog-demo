<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Find out if your phone will be affected here!</span></p>
<p>Have you heard the news? The people behind WhatsApp just made a pretty huge announcement about the future of the app.</p>
<p>From today, you won&rsquo;t be able to use it on some old operating systems. *Gasp* Take a moment to recovery from that shock&hellip; and then find out what the details are here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17836" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yWV2oEXJ6Kgvf7mEpk5Pr_JFiuO16pHTMeSlsBo1mwrhqho3aL6SjtnHTY3MkTYo5wagrVivVzIi3E-Cr3Z_vnZd=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Will Your Smartphone Still Run WhatsApp?</h2>
<p>Worried that your phone will wave a long goodbye to the many GIFs, giggles and group chats of WhatsApp? We hear you! Should you have an older smartphone, the last thing you want is to stop using the messaging app altogether.</p>
<p>Luckily, in a <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/s40/26000006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, the powers behind the company revealed a list of operating systems that will no longer support the app. There&rsquo;s bad news for you if your phone happens to run one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android versions older than 2.3.3</li>
<li>Windows Phone 8.0 and older</li>
<li>iPhone 3GS/iOS 6</li>
<li>Nokia Symbian S60</li>
<li>BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10</li>
</ul>
<p>While few phones still run these systems, it&rsquo;s worth checking out which your device has. The above systems have stopped working immediately, however, more systems will be added to the list as time goes on.</p>
<p>At the end of this year, the Nokia S40 will stop supporting the app and then in 2020 Android versions 2.3.7 and older, along with iOS 7 and older will follow suit. If your current device has any of these systems, you could find that your chatting days are numbered&hellip; on WhatsApp, anyway.</p>

<h2>What Can You Do About It?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve just spotted your operating system on the list, you might feel that mild surge of panic run through your veins. It&rsquo;s a scary time, for the best of us. So, what can you do to solve this problem? Well, the most obvious solution is to update the system that your device currently runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we'll no longer actively develop for these operating systems, some features might stop functioning at any time,&rdquo; says the post from WhatsApp. &ldquo;If you currently use an older operating system, we recommend upgrading to a newer version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That in itself couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Make sure that you&rsquo;ve backed everything up first. Next, on an iPhone, go to <strong>Settings > General > Software Update</strong>. Simple. On Android devices, it&rsquo;s a similar system. Head to <strong>Settings > Device > Update</strong>. If your phone will support a newer version of your operating system, this process shouldn&rsquo;t take long at all.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>some</em> older phones may not support new updates. Yikes. If that&rsquo;s the case, you have two options. You&rsquo;ll either have to get used to living a WhatsApp-less existence or treat yourself to a phone upgrade. The choice is yours!</p>
