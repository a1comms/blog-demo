<p>You wake up. Check your phone. Turn on the TV. Get dressed. Read some texts. Head to work. Sit in front of a computer for seven hours straight. Check your phone. Come home. Turn on the TV. Does anybody else feel as though modern life is just a series of screens?</p>
<p>From social media to your work life, much of what you do takes places inside technology. While there&rsquo;s no issue with that, some may worry about the effect that this could be having on our eyesight. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>What is Computer Vision Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Sounds scary, right? Well, worry not! This &lsquo;syndrome&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t quite as terrible as it may appear. Sure, it has a fancy-pants name, but that&rsquo;s about as far as things go.</p>
<p>In reality, Computer Vision Syndrome is just a technical term for the feeling of eye strain that we all get when we stare at computers for too long.</p>
<p>Some of the symptoms that you may experience include blurred vision, tiredness, and even headaches. We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>

<p>Since computers (and phone screens) are such a major part of modern life, you may worry about the effect that this is having. Luckily, it&rsquo;s not something that should be keeping you up at night!</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that staring at screens won&rsquo;t make you go blind and shouldn&rsquo;t cause any long-term damage. You can stop panicking now. However, there is a way that you can relieve your eyes from the strain of too much screen time.</p>
<h2>How to Save Your Eyes</h2>

<p>Whether your job involves sitting in front of a computer screen, or you like spending time browsing social media and news on your phone, there are some tricks you can try to save your eyes. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the options that you may want to try for yourself:</p>
<p><strong>The 20-20-20 Rule</strong></p>
<p>You may have heard of this rule before. It&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>Every 20 minutes, you should take a 20-second break from the screen you&rsquo;re looking at and focus your eyes on something that is at least 20 feet away from you. Doing so should give your eyesight the rest that it needs and refresh you a little. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Drops</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems that people encounter when it comes to staring at screens is that they get dry eyes. Yikes!</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, you can get yourself some mild eye drops to help remedy the problem. You should be able to pick some up at most pharmacies and they can help freshen up your eyes now and then.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Light-Filtering Glasses</strong></p>
<p>You may have heard the hype about &lsquo;blue light-filtering glasses&rsquo; already, but do they work? Well, the jury&rsquo;s still out on this one. Some doctors might not be convinced that these glasses do much for your eyes. However, they have had some positive reviews. It could be worth trying them for yourself!</p>
