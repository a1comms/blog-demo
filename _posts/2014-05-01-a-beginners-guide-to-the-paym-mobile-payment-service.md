<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Paym mobile payment service is a new service offered by many major banks in the UK, one which many people are predicting will change the financial world forever. We take a look at what it is, what you need to use it (hint: a smartphone like the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the HTC One M8, with your bank&rsquo;s mobile app and a UK phone number, and a bank account), and how Paym mobile pyament service might just be able to benefit you!</span></p>
<p>If you've been reading the news recently, you may well have heard of a brand new service for smartphones, a rather intriguing service that could potentially change the way we think about paying for things, and managing our finances.</p>
<p>The service in question is Paym, and many people are heralding it as a revolution in the financial world. That's a bold claim to make, but the fact is that the whole idea does seem rather intriguing indeed.</p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> the Paym mobile payment service? How exactly does it work, and how might it benefit you?</p>
<p>Let's take a look...</p>
<h2>Mobile Payments</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/14080132125_218f8e19fa_z.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="335" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Mobile payments have been predicted by many people to be <em>the</em> next big thing to hit the world of smartphones, and in fact, there&rsquo;s already evidence that mobile payment schemes can have a huge impact on how people manage their finances. One only needs to look at the runaway success of Orange Money, to see this in action; <em>ten million</em> people now use that service,&nbsp; in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>And so, in its simplest terms, Paym is a <em>mobile payment</em> service for smartphones, and describing it in simple terms is appropriate, as the way the Paym service works is simplicity itself!</p>
<h2>Like PayPal, but with a mobile number</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/13893533438_214246dbfb_z.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="332" /></span></strong></p>
<p>To put it simply, all you need is a smartphone with your bank&rsquo;s mobile app installed on it (assuming your bank is one of the ones signed up to offer the service; <em>that</em> list is made up of Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Cumberland Building Society, Danske Bank, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander and TSB), a mobile number, and a bank account.</p>
<p>Using the app, you link your mobile number to your account, and then anyone else who uses the Paym service can send you money, just by sending it to your mobile number! Conversely, you can send money to <em>other</em> people who use the service, letting you pay for builders, or babysitters, or whatever. You simply take your Samsung Galaxy S5, or your HTC One M8, or whatever phone you&rsquo;re using, and assuming the other person uses Paym, you just send the money to their mobile number.</p>
<p>Simplicity in action (and, it has to be said, not a little similar to how PayPal works; if it takes off in as big a way as PayPal has, then Paym could well be as revolutionary as people are predicting)!</p>
<p>Oh, and you cans also use a non-smartphone to receive payments (since it just uses a mobile number for incoming payments), although you won&rsquo;t be able to <em>send</em> money through Paym, as <em>that</em> is done through a specific smartphone app. Still, for people who prefer to use, say, a budget Nokia phone, it&rsquo;s nice that they won&rsquo;t miss out on at least part of the service.</p>
<h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
<p>Signing up is dead easy! All you need to do is contact your bank (assuming it&rsquo;s one on the list up there), register for the service, and they&rsquo;ll talk you through <em>exactly</em> what you need to do. Some bank, like TSB, only need you to register if you want to <em>receive</em> money, as well; for <em>sending</em> payments, you don&rsquo;t even need to do that!</p>
<p><strong>Of course, the Paym mobile payment service is currently an untested service in the UK (although similar schemes like Orange Money have performed well overseas), but there&rsquo;s so much potential here it&rsquo;s unbelievable. Paym might not change the financial world overnight, but in the long term? That&rsquo;s not an unrealistic goal... </strong></p>
