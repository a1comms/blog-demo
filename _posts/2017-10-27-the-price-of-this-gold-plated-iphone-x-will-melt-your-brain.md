<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You&rsquo;ve always wanted a gold-plated, diamond-encrusted dragon on your iPhone, right?</span></p>
<p>Legend, a Helsinki-based tech fashion company, is filling a particularly niche gap in the market after producing a series of super luxurious iPhone X models.</p>
<p>The company creates bespoke mobile phones, cased with high-quality materials (if you dig this kind of thing). The hand-finished mobile phones include things like bespoke engraving, stone-setting and precious metal plating.</p>
<p>If you visit the Atelier (aka workshop) on the Legend website, you can choose from materials like exotic leathers, silver and gold, and precious gems and stones which, are all fashioned together to create these handcrafted '<em>saw you coming' </em>style prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15379" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8UfK2M0PDhjUpdYFcZJrVYjJN9GPDF9NeCVbdQonc_hJ3eQhxZff19-hsnwWgSbSLCEArkIidTF-2KA8uYDhKR8u=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>'Out There' Design</h2>
<p>So, deep pockets required folks, the range exclusively covers the 256GB version of the iPhone X smartphone and is currently made up of six models (we can only assume these come SIM free). However, it looks as if a more personalised version of these can be created on request.</p>
<p>A casual iPhone X purchase from Legend will cost you a staggering &euro;3,390 for the <em>FUSION</em> design. It's fashioned from solid silver, mother of pearl and exotic leather - in case you don't have enough leather in your life already, this phone has it covered top to bottom.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15320 size-full" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W3m2Jbu5rZgfheYgSe0-MKtgSJbwFE7cb3MnVHJmuWxmH-j7xPjwM2KzX8tXuPUKS1tSGqwGiboz1ddIxannudOi=s0" alt="" width="445" height="570" />The <em>Lu</em> variant will cost you a hefty &euro;3,590, (you could get a decent second hand car for that) with a design based on Chinese symbolism. For those still interested after reading the price, the eyes of the dragon are hand set with genuine red diamonds surrounded by 24k gold. Perfect. If you're a&nbsp;<em>Bond&nbsp;</em>villain.</p>

<p>The Momentum design will cost an OTT &euro;3,790. This 65-man-hour concoction has all the luxury materials you can think of. And a red diamond centrepiece and a diamond halo too. So if you know anyone who loves diamonds, probably point them toward a more affordable outlet...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15391 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/custom-iphone-x.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="423" /></p>
<p>The cheapest from Legends selection (and we say that very lightly) starts at &euro;2,950, which is still plated in 24k gold and has a mother of pearl centrepiece. The other designs currently include the <em>Classique</em>, <em>AURUM</em>, and <em>CORIUM</em>, and as you would imagine, are as blinding in price and as pimped up as the rest!</p>
<h2>But Wait There's More</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15319" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cwMu5mAfO5jnFCzVnjpKUMLy59NOC-rjg3JP-NFIMVeN5cDStJcQfg0_-wEkFeLv-vf9sIzbXQSxpoQeBoUp_88=s0" alt="" />If you weren't content with the amount of gold and luxury leather flying about, included with each of the shiny iPhone X models is a wooden box, complete with a set of 24k gold plated AirPods. You also get a leather pouch and certificate of authenticity to show off to all your friends... Maybe not.</p>

<p>So, how would you go about purchasing one of these, if say, you won the lottery, happened to be movie star or just have very unique taste with money to burn?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15385" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nwQm1Oob33LfUHWRl9o_e8Y9ScZkkg_dkNpYwRPpXfxwswCQm-UntN3gd0OlTyFpP_opbD3Jwbj-q2lKKVfB7ZcisQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well, the Legend iPhone X range is exclusively available from only three retailers worldwide: a high-end store in Qatar, luxury retailer in Sydney, Australia, and a Hong Kong based premium product outlet. So, sorry UK fans, looks like you might have to hop on a flight to get your hands on one of these. Head over to the <a href="http://legend-helsinki.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legend website</a> for more info on these bad boys.</p>
<p>For us mere humans, and those that are part of a club where sanity prevails, why not treat yourself and pre-order the regular iPhone X at BuyMobiles.net?</p>
