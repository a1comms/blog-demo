<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Meet Google Pixel 3.</span></p>
<p>Brace yourself. We have news. The Google Pixel 3 and the Google Pixel 3 XL are here and you might well want to hear what they have to offer. Yes, the two flagship phones are ready and waiting for you. But, what can you expect when you get your hands on them? You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here are seven things you need to know.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKSA_idPZkc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>1) They Have an Awesome Two-Tone Design</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this look on Google phones before now and it&rsquo;s back yet again. The cool two-tone design gives both the Google Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL a flawlessly unique look. The top of the rear of the phone is made from shiny glass while the rest is a matte finish. That&rsquo;s not all. The rest of the design is minimal and looks akin to some of the latest flagships.</p>
<h2>2) The &lsquo;Not Pink&rsquo; Colour Is&hellip; Pink</h2>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic of the design, there&rsquo;s something else that you should know. The Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL both come in a range of attractive colours. You can get these smartphones in the aptly named Clearly White, Just Black, and Not Pink. The latter is a tongue-in-cheek name. When you take a look at the phone for yourself, it&rsquo;s clear to see that it very much is pink. However, it&rsquo;s a white-ish sort of pink that looks different in various lights. It should be enough to please anyone who was formerly on the &lsquo;Rose Gold&rsquo; hype.</p>
<h2>3)&nbsp;The Camera Setup Is Impressive</h2>
<p>These days, a smartphone without an epic camera setup isn&rsquo;t worth anybody&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s that simple. Of course, the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL both have an impressively advanced camera setup. On the rear, there&rsquo;s a 12.2-megapixel lens along with a f/1.8 aperture with OIS and EIS. Flip it over to the front, though, and you&rsquo;ve got a dual-lens offering, with two 8-megapixel lenses and a f/1.8 aperture. Reviews suggest that this setup allows users to take some epic and professional-style pictures in just a snap.</p>

<h2>4)&nbsp;Yes, They Have Wireless Charging</h2>
<p>One of the burning questions that&rsquo;s certain to be on your mind is: Does the device have wireless charging? Well, you&rsquo;re in luck. Here&rsquo;s a fantastic feature that the latest smartphones are boasting right now. Yes, both the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have the standard Qi wireless charging feature which goes up to 10 watts. That means that you will be ahead of the game when it comes to juicing up your phone. Nice.</p>
<h2>5)&nbsp;The Battery Has Seen a Boost</h2>
<p>If you cast your mind back to the Google Pixel 2 (which had a 2700 mAh battery!) for a moment, you will see that there&rsquo;s been a real boost here. The Google Pixel 3 has upped the game again with a 2915 mAh unit. Of course, the Pixel 3 XL model has a larger battery still, coming in at 3430 mAh. The idea is simple enough &ndash;&nbsp;Google has dedicated time to improving the battery as much as possible. That means that you should have enough power to keep you going all day long with these devices.</p>
<h2>6)&nbsp;The Specs Stand up to Flagship Phones</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to see where the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL stand in the market is to look at the specs. Both of the phones run the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset along with the Android 9 Pie. That means that you can expect a great amount of power and quality from both of the Google phones. The proof is in the pudding, though. You will need to give these devices a whirl for yourself to find out how speedy they really are.</p>

<h2>7)&nbsp;Searching Online Has Never Been Easier!</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting feature that both the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have is the Google Lens. The snazzy function means that you can literally start a new search by holding your phone up to an item and clicking away. For example, if you see a landmark in the street and want to know more about it, you just need to grab your phone, take a shot and get searching. In moments, you will have all the Google results you could want along with information on the landmark and where it is. Magical.</p>
