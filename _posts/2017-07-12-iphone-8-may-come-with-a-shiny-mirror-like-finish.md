<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This is something to reflect on&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s next iPhone - rumoured to be <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-8-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lsquo;iPhone 8&rsquo;</a> - may be a couple of months away, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop the world speculating on just what is in store for us. Recently, there&rsquo;s been a surge of fresh rumours about what to expect when the new device launches, apparently this September.</p>
<p>The first question we all want answered is what on earth &lsquo;iPhone 8&rsquo; will look like. Since the design hasn&rsquo;t changed all too much in recent years, beyond a few subtle tweaks and removal of the headphone jack, as well as the water-resistant protection, we expect Apple may shake it up.</p>
<p>Well, just a few days ago, a somewhat trusted source revealed on Twitter what that shake up might look like.</p>
<p>Known Apple leaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1">Benjamin Geskin</a>, shared an interesting idea with the world. According to him, &lsquo;iPhone 8&rsquo; will sport a mirror like finish. Yep, you might be able to see your beautiful reflection in it, smiling back at you. Just speculation? We don't know at this point.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2017 OLED iPhone - four colors. New one - mirror like. <a href="https://t.co/BFBBpBQ2Vm">pic.twitter.com/BFBBpBQ2Vm</a></p>

<p>Alongside this apparent leak, plenty of rumours have surfaced online to support the case that Apple&rsquo;s mixing the design up this year. TechRadar seem confident that &lsquo;iPhone 8&rsquo; will be available in six different colours, including the aforementioned mirror finish.</p>
<p>While expanding the colour range would be a clever move, perhaps limiting it and changing the finish of the phone would be an even better one. After all, Apple has always been known for its simplicity and individuality.</p>
<p>Of course, this is by no means the only &lsquo;iPhone 8&rsquo; rumour floating around the web.
