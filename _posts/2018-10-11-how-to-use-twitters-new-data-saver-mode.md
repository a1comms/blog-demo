<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Save on Twitter data so you can use it elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>Spoiler: Your social media apps could be draining your data. If you find yourself running out of your allowance month after month, there could be a good reason.</p>
<p>For example, when you scroll through the Twitter app, it takes a huge amount of data to load pictures, videos, and other media. Yikes. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a quick way to put a stop to that.</p>
<h2>How to Turn on Data Saver Mode</h2>
<p>Ready to start saving yourself some extra data? Luckily, the new Twitter mode can help you do just that in the click of a button. Before you do anything else, you should make sure that you have the latest version of the app on your phone.</p>
<p>You can do that by either going to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play Store</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> and clicking update.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sure that you have the latest version, you can go right ahead and switch modes. The mode is now available on most versions of Twitter for iOS and Android devices. It couldn&rsquo;t be easier to get started. Head to <strong>Settings and privacy > Data usage</strong> and then turn on the &lsquo;<strong>Data saver</strong>&rsquo; mode. Simple!</p>

<h2>What Does the Mode Do?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a casual Twitter user, you probably won&rsquo;t see a huge difference when you first switch to the data saver mode. The images won&rsquo;t load in high quality when it&rsquo;s in this mode, which is one way in which it saves data. However, if you want to take a closer look at certain images, you can still click it and select the &lsquo;Load High Quality&rsquo; option.</p>
<p>Another change that you may &ndash; or, indeed, may not &ndash;&nbsp;notice is that videos no longer have the autoplay feature. So, again, if you want to watch a video that someone has tweeted you will need to click on it and select an option to do so. Of course, these are small changes when it comes to usability, but they may help save your data allowance.</p>

<h2>What About the Twitter Lite App?</h2>
<p>The data saver mode on the standard Twitter app is useful if you&rsquo;re looking to cut back but there&rsquo;s another option you might want to consider.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android.lite&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Lite app</a> saves you data as well but it has an added advantage. This app takes up less space on your mobile device too, which could be a huge bonus.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking to save data and space, it could be the way to go for you. The choice is yours!</p>
