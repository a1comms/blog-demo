<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This is basically an airbag with legs, for your phone.</span></p>
<p>Have you ever felt that heart-sinking fear of totally losing grip of your mobile phone? Yes, we thought so. We&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<p>For the lucky among us, dropping your mobile may mean a few mere scratches. But spare a moment to think of the not-so-lucky &ndash; the ones who have to deal with a smashed screen or, worse, a mobile that never powers on again. It hardly bears thinking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why most us keep our phones safe with sturdy cases and screen protectors. If you&rsquo;re a complete and utter butterfingers, though, you might want to consider getting a little extra protection for your precious little device. So, how about a &lsquo;mobile airbag?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not messing around here. Thanks to a genius idea from one German engineering student, this dream product could soon be a reality. Philip Frenzel has created a prototype gadget that detects when your phone is falling and deploys sponge-like legs to soften its fall. And, yes, this thing is exactly as cool as it sounds.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPTFo3CPrqU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The idea popped into Frenzel&rsquo;s head after he himself dropped his iPhone. (Yes, the student has a tech-related sob story of his own&hellip; brace yourself!)</p>
<p>When his device slipped out of his jacket pocket and hit the floor with, presumably, a horrid crashing sound, the real trouble began. Not only was the phone screen broken in several places but the iPhone was never the same again.</p>
<p>After the pain (or, perhaps, just sheer annoyance!) of this experience, Frenzel decided to do something about it. He came up with the idea of making a phone case with special sensors fitted to it. When the sensors feel that the phone is falling, the case pushes out &lsquo;legs,&rsquo; which are on metal springs. Pretty nifty, right?</p>
<p>The case is called an Active Damping Case or, simply, an ADcase and &ldquo;combines maximum protection with elegant design,&rdquo; according to its <a href="https://www.ad-case.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site</a>. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;case that is so smart that it even makes a difference whether it&rsquo;s in your hand, in your pocket, or in free fall. A case that supports the user and offers real value added.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The design is so impressive that it has won Frenzel the 2018 award from the German Society of Mechatronics. What&rsquo;s more, he has already patented the idea and plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign later this month. So, if you like what you hear, you might not need to wait all that long until you can have the ADcase for yourself. Nice!</p>
