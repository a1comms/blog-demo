<p><span class="postStandFirst">Joins us as we review iPhone 6. Is it as good as the hype suggests? Is the new, bigger screen worth the increase in the phone&rsquo;s physical size? Do the new features offer enhancements to your life? It&rsquo;s time to find out...</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no doubt about it: one of the biggest events in the mobile world&rsquo;s annual diary is the launch of a new iPhone. So it&rsquo;s not at all surprising that the 2014 launch of iPhone 6 sent people all round the world into a tizzy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not at all surprising that it&rsquo;s gone on to become one of the most popular smartphones ever made. Seriously, this phone has sold by the bucket load, and there are millions of them out there in the wild, right now.</p>
<p>But is it simply because of Apple&rsquo;s perceived &lsquo;cool factor&rsquo;, or is it because, when you get right down to it, iPhone 6 is just an incredibly good phone?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out...</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the design, because this is where we see our first big difference between iPhone 6 and its predecessors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all down to the fact that iPhone 6 has a bigger screen, and while we&rsquo;ll talk about that in its own subsection, we have to also look at what effect the increased screen size has had on the overall design of the phone.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, it&rsquo;s made the phone bigger. However, the jump in size might not be quite as big as you&rsquo;re expecting: where iPhone 5s measured 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm, the iPhone 6 comes in at 138.1 x 67 x 6.9 mm.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6976 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15342093370_6c05d15784_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Design 2" width="800" height="209" /></p>
<p>So, Apple&rsquo;s new&nbsp;<em>wunderkind</em>&nbsp;is only 9mm wider, and just over 14mm taller, than its predecessor. That&rsquo;s not a massive jump by any definition, and it also brings another neat little benefit with it; because the phone is wider&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;taller, components can be spread out a bit inside the body-shell, instead of being, effectively, stacked up on top of each other.</p>
<p>And so, iPhone 6 has actually got skinnier, from front to back, with a drop of just over half a centimetre compared to its predecessor. This loss in girth makes it a real joy to hold the phone, a feeling that&rsquo;s made even better by the cool, sleek finish of the metal body.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6975 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15342168078_7752241e30_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Design" width="800" height="154" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already mentioned how the increased screen size has affected the design, so now it&rsquo;s time to take a closer look at that screen, and see how nice it is to look at, and to actually use as the primary input method for your phone.</p>
<p>The screen on iPhone 6 measures at 4.7-inches, which is a lot bigger than the 4-inch screen on iPhone 5s, and closer to its main rivals in the Android arena; Samsung Galaxy Alpha springs to mind, since it also has a 4.7-inch screen, as well as the 5-inch&nbsp;HTC One M8.</p>
<p>Naturally, that increase in screen size is going to change how you use iPhone 6, as it does admittedly make it less convenient to use one-handed.</p>
<p>That may put some people off, but for our money, the pay-off (the increase in screen real estate) is&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;than worth it, and since Apple&rsquo;s sold over 10 million of these beauties, we&rsquo;d hazard a guess and say that quite a lot of people agree with that sentiment!</p>
<p>Along with the increase in size, the resolution has also been increased to 750 x 1334 pixels, giving iPhone 6 a pixel density of 326 per inch. While that may not come close to the preposterously sharp Quad-HD screen on LG G3, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with the resolution Apple chose.</p>
<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s still nice and sharp, but it won&rsquo;t have as much of an impact on battery life as a 1080p screen, so it&rsquo;s easy to see why Apple opted for this particular resolution.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6977 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15342200488_3a8425e593_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Display" width="800" height="308" /></p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about the performance of any phone, there&rsquo;s a tendency to play the numbers game, and look at how many cores the processor has, or megahertz the processor can pump out, as well as the amount of RAM that it stores.</p>
<p>If we do that with iPhone 6, we&rsquo;ll find that it &ldquo;only&rdquo; has a dual-core processor (albeit a 64-bit processor), which is &ldquo;only&rdquo; clocked to 1.4GHz, and the phone &ldquo;only&rdquo; has 1GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the root of the problem: with an Android phone, that might give us a baseline to compare it to&nbsp;<em>other </em>Android phones, but iOS is&nbsp;<em>totally, completely, utterly</em>&nbsp;different, at a coding-level, to Android.</p>
<p>Every iPhone is&nbsp;<em>specifically&nbsp;</em>optimised to run iOS, and iOS is&nbsp;<em>specifically</em>&nbsp;optimised to run on iPhone, and that renders the numbers game meaningless.</p>
<p>The only way to judge iPhone 6 is by how well it performs in-hand, and we can say with absolute certainty, that it&nbsp;<em>flies</em>. The performance is incredible, falling on-par (at least) with the very best Android smartphones.</p>
<p>The only downside we can see is not&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;a downside, per se; it would have been nice to see iPhone 6 have a lot more RAM; it has a 64-bit processor which can support over 4GB of RAM, so while 1GB is still enough to give you stutter-free performance, it would have been nicer to see a little more.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>As with the performance, the camera&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;area where we can&rsquo;t really play the numbers game, no matter how much we instinctively want to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said on many occasions that looking at just the raw megapixel count is a pretty inaccurate way to judge how quality a phone&rsquo;s camera is, and that&rsquo;s certainly the case here.</p>
<p>On paper, iPhone 6 has an 8MP camera that doesn&rsquo;t come close to rivals like the 16MP Samsung Galaxy S5, or the 20.7MP&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z3.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the 8MP sensor in iPhone 6 is physically bigger, thus making each pixel bigger, and allowing it to sample more light. That leads to photos with&nbsp;<em>far</em>&nbsp;less digital noise (something helped by the fact it also uses HDR).</p>
<p>It also has a dual-LED flash, and the two LEDs in it throw out different <em>colours</em>, leading to more natural hues on photos taken with the camera light turned on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just still images that have been improved; the frame-rate of videos has also been doubled, so that 1080p videos can be captured at 60fps (frames per second), and 720p videos can be recorded at a whopping 240fps.<strong><br />
<img class=" size-full wp-image-6979 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15342152680_58f634e2c1_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Camera" width="800" height="401" /></strong></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at how the design&rsquo;s changed, what the new screen is like, and how fast the phone is, but now it&rsquo;s time to factor in iOS itself, and see how iPhone 6 can work to enhance your life.</p>
<p>The first is the inclusion of NFC, so you can finally embrace mobile payments with your iPhone. It uses Apple Pay, and while some have criticised it for not linking to services like PayPal, anyone who uses an iPhone will have set up an iTunes account, so there&rsquo;s an odds-on chance that their payment details are already stored.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6981 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15528547582_c861f17107_c.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Apple Pay" width="800" height="495" /></p>
<p>Thus, we&rsquo;re not sure Apple Pay&nbsp;<em>needs</em>&nbsp;to link to anything else. Of course, Apple Pay is primarily a USA thing at the minute, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;wending its way over here, so we&rsquo;re thinking we might well see big things from this new service.</p>
<p>The other big inclusion is the Health app, specifically the Healthkit part of it that allows other, <em>third-party</em>&nbsp;health and fitness apps to link into it, sharing and collating data to allow you to better manage your health/fitness plan.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6980 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/06/15528547432_55a5b22155_z.jpg" alt="iPhone 6 Healthkit" width="640" height="549" /></p>
<p>Another nice feature is Handoff, although you&rsquo;ll also need a Mac (running OS X Yosemite), or a recent iPad, to be able to use it. Handoff allows you to start doing something on one device, writing an email for example, and then continue doing it on&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;Apple device.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to Family Sharing, which allows six users to be linked to one account, so that they can all make purchases through iTunes, using&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;the credit card info on the main &ldquo;parent&rdquo; account.</p>
<p>That means you also have control over what purchases your kids can make through their iPhones, so the little darlings can&rsquo;t run up a bill that would cost you around the same amount as the GDP of San Marino!</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>As you may have already guessed, our opinion of iPhone 6 is this: it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>superb</em>&nbsp;phone.</p>
<p>Sure, there may be some little things that we&rsquo;d change, like the amount of RAM for example, but the simple fact is that this really is one of the single best smartphones money can buy.</p>
<p>It looks fantastic, it&rsquo;s packed with tons of features (and with even more available, in the form of apps from the App Store), and it&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;provide you with loads of ways to enhance your life.</p>
<p><strong>As such, iPhone 6 is&nbsp;<em>highly</em>&nbsp;recommended. Smartphones really don&rsquo;t come much better than this!&nbsp;</strong></p>
