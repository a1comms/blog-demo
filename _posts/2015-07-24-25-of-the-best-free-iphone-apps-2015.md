<p><span class="postStandFirst">The App Store now boasts over 1.5 million apps &ndash; in honour, we&rsquo;ve handpicked 25 of the best, all of which are free to download.</span></p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s latest iPhone ad (posted below) maintains that the App Store is now teaming with a mind-boggling 1.5 million apps.</p>
<p>If we were to assume that the <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/ios-app-size-averages-at-23-mb-16-percent-increase-since-march-17252428/">average iOS app size is 23MB</a>, you would require approximately 2,632 iPhone 6s (16GB) to download and store each and every one of them.</p>
<p>With numbers as totally ridiculous as that, you can imagine that almost every concept, idea and conceivable notion has been reimagined as an app.</p>
<p>Like the slightly dubious Lobola Calculator, for gauging your spouse's worth in cows. Or Kawaii Assistant, the app that provides you with your very own Japanese assistant, called Suki, who apparently can&rsquo;t get enough of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
<p>So to save you the hassle of wading through some of more superfluous apps out there, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of 25 of the best free iPhone apps available right now.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vainglory/id671464704?mt=8">1) Vainglory</a></strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7478 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Vain-Glory.jpg" alt="Vain Glory" width="941" height="261" /></p>
<p>Featured by Apple during its 2014 keynote, Vainglory brings the kind of gameplay and graphics you&rsquo;re used to on consoles, right to your iPhone. You can take on real opponents in a multiplayer online battle arena, endeavour to destroy the enemy Vain crystal and finally reach out and claim glory for yourself &ndash; all the while relishing the high-fidelity visuals.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pacemaker-dj/id593873080?mt=8"><strong>2) Pacemaker</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7479 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Pacemaker.jpg" alt="Pacemaker" width="817" height="460" /></p>
<p>Pacemaker turns your phone into a portable music mixer, blending your favourite songs from iTunes or Spotify seamlessly into each other. When you want to skip a track, the flow of the groove doesn&rsquo;t stop, instead a unique composite is born. Could this be the end for wedding DJs?</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8"><strong>3) Duolingo</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7480 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Duolingo.jpg" alt="Duolingo" width="816" height="458" /></p>
<p>Wish you could parle Fran&ccedil;ias? Or harblar Espagnol? Duolingo is the best app out there for learning a new language &ndash; totally free. It offers fun and interactive learning methods for 10 different languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Irish, Dutch, Swedish and English) and sends you prompts if you&rsquo;re not meeting your goals.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8"><strong>4) Spotify</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7481 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify" width="816" height="460" /></p>
<p>Stream all of your favourite music, on-demand and free of charge. You can search for any track, album or artist of your liking, and build your own playlists from Spotify&rsquo;s enormous library. Sadly, the free version does subject you to the occasional advert in between songs, but it&rsquo;s a small price to pay.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/runkeeper-gps-running-walk/id300235330?mt=8"><strong>5) RunKeeper</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7482 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/RunKeeper.jpg" alt="RunKeeper" width="816" height="460" /></p>
<p>Use your iPhone&rsquo;s GPS to track your runs, walks, bike rides and any other activities, and see what distance you cover and the pace you set. RunKeeper also charts your weight loss, as well as your journey towards smashing personal fitness goals. It suits all skill levels and many training activities.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crossy-road-endless-arcade/id924373886?mt=8"><strong>6) Crossy Road</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7483 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Crossy-Road1.jpg" alt="Crossy Road" width="818" height="461" /></p>
<p>Crossy Road &ndash; the millennial generation&rsquo;s Frogger &ndash; is an addictive game that will no doubt seduce you into hours of fun and frustration. The aim of the game is simple, help your avatar cross the seemingly endless road in front, tallying as many steps as possible. But the execution is more challenging, with innumerable pitfalls, dangers and other snaring perils awaiting you.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/linkedin/id288429040?mt=8"><strong>7) LinkedIn</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7484 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="LinkedIn" width="824" height="467" /></p>
<p>LinkedIn is the professional equivalent to Facebook. Rather than drunk selfies and cat pictures, you&rsquo;ll find industry news, business-orientated people and new job opportunities. Your profile acts as a professional CV, and a window in which you can advertise your worth to any potential employers.</p>
<h2><strong>8) Storehouse</strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7485 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Storehouse.jpg" alt="Storehouse" width="826" height="470" /></p>
<p>Visual storytelling at its finest, Storehouse combines your photos, videos and text to create stunning tales of your life. You can import media from your camera roll, or alternatively from other apps like Instagram, and share your stories with your friends and followers on Storehouse.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/elevate-brain-training/id875063456?mt=8"><strong>9) Elevate</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7486 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Elevate.jpg" alt="Elevate" width="825" height="468" /></p>
<p>Elevate is a brain training program that challenges you with stimulating games, designed to help hone your focus, speaking abilities, processing speed, memory, maths skills and your overall deftness of mind.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997?mt=8"><strong>10) WhatsApp Messenger</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7487 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/WhatsApp-Messenger.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Messenger" width="815" height="459" /></p>
<p>WhatsApp&rsquo;s one of the most ubiquitous apps out there; everyone and your nan has it, so there&rsquo;s little for me to say that you don&rsquo;t already know. It&rsquo;s <em>the </em>choice app for messaging friends over the internet, rather than cellular coverage. It supports pictures, audio notes and videos, as well as calls.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8"><strong>11) 1Password</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7488 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/1Password.jpg" alt="1Password" width="817" height="461" /></p>
<p>Similar to iCloud Keychain, 1Password stores all of your passwords so you don&rsquo;t have to rack your brain trying to remember them. It also banks your credit cards, identities and notes. With iOS 8, it&rsquo;s fully compatible with Touch ID, and can therefore be used in Safari. And there&rsquo;s a bespoke browser built in, called 1Browser, for more private web surfing.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smith-hotels-boutique-luxury/id445834586?mt=8"><strong>12) Smith Hotels</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7489 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Smith-Hotels.jpg" alt="Smith Hotels" width="817" height="460" /></p>
<p>This app is as beautifully designed as the hotels and boutiques it advertises. Granted, Smith Hotels is targeted at travellers on a more substantial budget, so it might not suit all, but for those looking for an unrivalled collection of places to stay on your travels. It lists over 950 establishments, across 100s of destinations in the UK, Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/layout-from-instagram/id967351793?mt=8"><strong>13) Layout from Instagram</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7490 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Layout-from-Instagram.jpg" alt="Layout from Instagram" width="819" height="460" /></p>
<p>Brought to you from the guys at Instagram (and Facebook), Layout gives you the tools you need to blend your photos together to create unique collages, remixing up to 9 at a time. You might wonder why Instagram endured the hassle of designing a whole new app, rather than adding the layout feature to its existing app, but you&rsquo;ll no doubt rate it nonetheless.</p>
<h2><strong>14) The FIFA Weekly</strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7491 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/The-FIFA-Weekly.jpg" alt="The FIFA Weekly" width="822" height="462" /></p>
<p>Football crazy? FIFA mad? Download The FIFA Weekly app to digest the beautiful game&rsquo;s most current news and stories. It brings you reports on world-class players (still yet to see one on Bendtner), match results and goals, in-depth analysis so you can impress your oblivious mates, and lots more other goodies.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/does-not-commute/id971756507?mt=8"><strong>15) Does not Commute</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7492 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Does-not-Commute.jpg" alt="Does not Commute" width="939" height="259" /></p>
<p>Recently recognised in Apple&rsquo;s Design Awards for its highly stylise and beautiful aesthetics, Does not Commute is a strategic driving game that starts out as a peaceful commute in a small 1970s town, but quickly devolves into traffic chaos in which players race themselves in a trippy temporal paradox.</p>
<h2><strong>16) Sunrise Calendar</strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7493 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Sunrise-Calendar.jpg" alt="Sunrise Calendar" width="821" height="464" /></p>
<p>Dubbed by The Verge as &ldquo;the best calendar app for iPhone&rdquo;, Sunrise Calendar connects to your Exchange, Google and iCloud account, as well as other services like Facebook and Evernote, to keep you up to date on everything that&rsquo;s going on in your busy, busy life. A clean and beautiful design contribute to its intuitive user experience.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/forza-football-live-scores/id500138120?mt=8">17) Forza Football</a></strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7494 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Forza-Football.jpg" alt="Forza Football" width="824" height="466" /></p>
<p>Supplanting Sky Sports as my choice app for live football, Forza pushes everything from line-ups, goals and results to your mobile in real time. You can set up notifications for all of your favourite teams (including specific competitions and leagues), and even cast your vote in opinion polls about your team.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/transferwise-money-transfer/id612261027?mt=8"><strong>18) TransferWise Money Transfer</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7495 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/TransferWise-Money-Transfer.jpg" alt="TransferWise Money Transfer" width="818" height="461" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever travelled abroad and found yourself short of funds, you&rsquo;ve probably had to endure irksome bank fees for transferring money across. TransferWise Money Transfer claims to send money overseas at &lsquo;the lowest possible&rsquo; cost, at just 10% of the normal rate. Not only does it reduce hidden fees for you, but it&rsquo;s also refreshingly quick and easy.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id1008842996?mt=8&amp;pt=Referral&amp;ct=Travelex.co.uk_AppPage_Apple2"><strong>19) Travelex Money</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7496 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Travelex-Money.jpg" alt="Travelex Money" width="823" height="465" /></p>
<p>One way to ensure you don&rsquo;t find yourself short of funds when travelling abroad, is by downloading Travelex Money. It gives you access to the latest exchange rates, and allows you to order currency for home delivery or click and collect. It also features a neat expenditure calculator to help work out how much money you should take with you.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/just-eat-takeaway-food-delivery/id566347057?mt=8"><strong>20) Just Eat</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7497 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Just-Eat.jpg" alt="Just Eat" width="825" height="470" /></p>
<p>Created by some students who just could not be bothered to cook for themselves at university, Just Eat has established itself as the go-to app for ordering local takeaway food. Rather than rummaging through junk mail looking for tattered menus, you can access thousands right from your iPhone. Just Eat allows you to filter by cuisine type, rating, offer, distance and name, and you can order straight from the app &ndash; no phone call necessary.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/strava-running-cycling-gps/id426826309?mt=8"><strong>21) Strava</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7498 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Strava.jpg" alt="Strava" width="823" height="468" /></p>
<p>A great alternative to RunKeeper, Strava records and maps yours runs and rides using GPS, so you can measure distance covered, the speed you travel and any elevation you might gain. You can follow your friends to compare workouts, and see how you fare against locals and pros. Of course, a fitness app wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a social sharing function that promotes your hard work, much to the annoyance of your more languid friends.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188?mt=8"><strong>22) Evernote Scannable</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7499 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Evernote-Scannable.jpg" alt="Evernote Scannable" width="822" height="466" /></p>
<p>This is one of the most practical apps we&rsquo;ve come across, and of particular value to anyone averse to office clutter. Evernote Scannble converts any contracts, receipts or other paperwork into more manageable digital copies, by scanning them. The result is automatically adjusted and retuned for clear presentation, and can be shared easily with friends or colleagues, as well as exported as PDF and JPG files.</p>
<h2><strong>23) Pushbullet</strong></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7500 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Pushbullet.jpg" alt="Pushbullet" width="822" height="466" /></p>
<p>Pushbullet lets you feign productivity when you&rsquo;re in the office, because it brings calls, texts and other notifications right to your computer. You won&rsquo;t need to steal furtive glances at your mobile all day. Pushbullet further connects your devices by allowing you to send files or links between them. That article you didn&rsquo;t quite finish reading at lunch, just send it to your phone for later.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613?mt=8"><strong>24) Kindle</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7501 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Kindle.jpg" alt="Kindle" width="823" height="464" /></p>
<p>Some might not realise that you don&rsquo;t need to own one of Amazon&rsquo;s bespoke e-readers to make use of its gargantuan library of ebooks. Anyone who downloads the Kindle app gives themselves access to over 3,000,000 books, though only a small proportion of them are free. You can customise your reading experience with different typefaces and type sizes, as well as different backgrounds.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flipboard-your-social-news/id358801284?mt=8"><strong>25) Flipboard</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7502 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/Flipboard.jpg" alt="Flipboard" width="822" height="465" /></p>
<p>If you like digesting news and features across a broad range of subjects and sources, you&rsquo;ll wonder how you ever lived without Flipboard. After highlighting your favourite topics, it assembles various articles into a stream of content, which you flip through at your own leisure. It quickly becomes a highly personalised magazine that forever updates itself with fresh content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
