<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The UK is the first country to launch a national, youth-led code of conduct for the internet.</span></p>
<p>The Duke of Cambridge has launched a nationwide campaign to tackle cyberbullying, with the support of large media and technology companies including EE.</p>
<p>The campaign, called <em>Stop, Speak, Support</em>, has been launched by The Royal Foundation in time with Anti-Bullying week, and is aimed at reaching out to children and young people between the ages of 11-16, encouraging them to prevent cyberbullying by actively speaking out.</p>
<p>With cyberbullying potentially affecting anyone with access to the internet via a mobile phone, tablet or PC, social media and communication companies, including Facebook, Snapchat and EE, have announced plans to support the campaign in building awareness and offering preventions.</p>
<p>The Duke of Cambridge has been working The Royal Foundation's Taskforce on the Prevention of Cyberbullying, and has released a video to share the reasons why he&rsquo;s motivated to prevent cyberbullying, talking to two women and their experiences of it.</p>

<p>Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive and taskforce charity partner, said: &ldquo;We know it can be very difficult for young people being bullied online or in person to tell someone what&rsquo;s happening to them. Many are simply too scared to speak out or they believe somehow that it&rsquo;s their fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By helping to create the &lsquo;Stop, Speak, Support&rsquo; campaign we are empowering young people to support their friends who are being bullied online.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Stop, Speak, Support Code</h2>
<p><strong>STOP</strong></p>
<p>Action 1: Take time out before getting involved, and don&rsquo;t share or like negative comments.</p>
<p>Action 2: Try and get an overview of what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>Action 3: Check the community guidelines for the site you&rsquo;re on.</p>

<h2>Advice for Parents</h2>
<p>As well as reaching out to children and young adults, the Stop, Speak, Support campaigns provides specific advice to parents, and the steps they can take to keep their children safe online.</p>
<p>Carolyn Bunting, general manager of taskforce partner Internet Matters, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children are born into a digital world; they are learning, communicating and growing up online. But the online world can pose certain risks, such as cyberbullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parents need to ensure they&rsquo;ve had early conversations with their children about the importance of staying safe online and help build their digital resilience.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Useful Links</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a victim of cyberbullying, or know someone else who is, be it a friend or family member, please speak up and seek support.</p>
