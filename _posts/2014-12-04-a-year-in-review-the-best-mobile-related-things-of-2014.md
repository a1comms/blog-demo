<p><span class="postStandFirst">2014 has been a rather exciting year, what with one thing and another, with a ton of awesome new phones, and really intriguing technological innovations going on left, right and centre. Join us as we take a look back at 2014, to pick out our highlights of the year...</span></p>
<p>Blimey, doesn&rsquo;t time fly when you&rsquo;re having fun? 2014 seems to have just <i>flown</i> by, and now that the year is almost up, it&rsquo;s time to take a look at the best bits of the year that was.</p>
<p>And no, this is not a list of the top smartphones of 2014. You can probably take a guess at what phones would be in that list, but <i>this</i> is something else; <i>this</i> list encompasses everything that&rsquo;s happened in the mobile industry this year, not <i>just</i> phones.</p>
<p>So, make yourself a brew, get yourself comfy, and let&rsquo;s start with...</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best operating system of 2014</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6045" alt="Android Lollipop" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Android-Lollipop-1024x570.png" width="672" height="374" />This one is quite a hard one to judge, since all of the Big 3 platforms have seen major updates and improvements in 2014. There&rsquo;s all the new <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple">iOS</a> enhancements you&rsquo;ll find in the iPhone 6, for one thing, and at the same time, Windows Phone has been making some serious strides in terms of sheer brilliance.</p>
<p>However, we have to give this award to Android, chiefly because of the Android Lollipop update (already rolling out to the LG G3, and due to hit phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 in due course; if you&rsquo;ve seen it in action, you know just how gob-smackingly beautiful and sleek the new update is, and thus Android, the most popular smartphone platform in the world, is our choice for the best OS of 2014.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best virtual assistant of 2014</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4774" alt="Hi, I'm Cortana." src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/Hi-Im-Cortana..jpg" width="658" height="364" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, since Android won the best OS category, Google Now does not win the best virtual assistant award. No, that honour goes to Cortana, as found in Windows Phone. She may not have the proper Cortana voice here in the UK, but she&rsquo;s still the most innovative and feature-packed virtual assistant on smartphones. Put simply, she&rsquo;s awesome!</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most exciting thing that went basically nowhere of 2014</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6093" alt="firefox_OS" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/firefox_OS.jpg" width="610" height="341" /></p>
<p>Around the start of the year, a great many of us got very excited about the raft of new operating systems hitting the industry, and this category is won by <i>all</i> of them except Firefox OS. Why? Well with the exception of Firefox, which is carving out a niche for itself in developing markets, how many of them have you heard about recently?</p>
<p>Precisely. Therefore, &ldquo;the new operating system&rdquo; wins this award.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most exciting thing that <i>will</i> be huge in future... of 2014</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6092" alt="Project-Ara-smartphone-640x227" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Project-Ara-smartphone-640x227.jpg" width="640" height="227" /></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Project Ara. It has to be Project Ara, really, because not only is the concept of a fully modular smartphone <i>a really cool thing indeed</i>, it&rsquo;s also using 3D printing as its main manufacturing method.</p>
<p>That, right there, is the future.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Biggest non-surprise of 2014</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5484" alt="Nokia Lumia 920" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/nokia-lumia-920-xl.jpg" width="672" height="448" /></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s one of those moments that everyone knew was coming, but that no-one really expected to happen: the moment when Microsoft dropped the Nokia branding from its Lumia phones, effectively marking the end of <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/nokia">Nokia phones</a> in the smartphone world.</p>
<p>We all knew it was inevitable, we just didn&rsquo;t expect it to be <i>inevitably </i>inevitable...</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best mobile game of 2014</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6091" alt="angry-birds-transformers-share" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/angry-birds-transformers-share.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>This award is a bit of a personal thing for the author, as he loves <i>Angry Birds</i>, and he&rsquo;s also been a <i>Transformers</i> fan for 30 years.</p>
<p>Yes, the mobile game of the year is <i>Angry Birds Transformers</i>! You have to do an <i>awful</i> lot of grinding to unlock anything, and the whole thing has the unmistakable whiff of free-to-play (with every action basically taking hours to complete unless you spend money), but when it does let you actually go out and shoot piggies, it&rsquo;s one of the most addictively fun mobile gaming experiences in years!</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Smartphone of the year, 2014</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4212" alt="Great alternative to the Amazon Fire phone" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/LG-G3-2-847x1024.jpg" width="474" height="574" /></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the big one, the best smartphone of 2014, and there are <i>so</i> many candidates this year. 2014 really has been a bumper fun pack of brilliance, with phones like the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S5 wowing everyone, the HTC One M8 showing everyone a new world of smartphone photography, and the Moto G 4G coming in and showing everyone, <i>again</i>, how to do an amazing budget phone.</p>
<p>There can be only one, though, and this year, the winner is... the LG G3!</p>
<p>Seriously, the LG G3 is an <i>exemplary</i> phone, with bags of power and a brilliant camera, but what really sets it apart is that Quad-HD screen. Sure, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has the same resolution screen, but the LG G3 was the first, and that tends to leave an impression.</p>
<p>Combine that with achingly pretty looks, and the inescapable conclusion is that the LG G3 is something very special indeed. And so, it has to be our phone of the year.</p>
