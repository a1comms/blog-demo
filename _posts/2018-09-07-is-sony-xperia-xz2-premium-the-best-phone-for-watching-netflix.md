<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The ultimate entertainment handset!</span></p>
<p>Sony has a strong background in camera and TV technology and packed all this into the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium. This year is no exception, with the Xperia XZ2 Premium boasting one of its best camera and visual setups yet.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;d expect its &lsquo;Premium&rsquo; name tag means this phone is packed with all the goods. Let&rsquo;s take a look into the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zq6iOiZHXVs" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design and Display</h2>
<p>It's not often we see a major Sony design over haul from between new releases. With that in mind, Xperia XZ2 Premium adopts the same style as the previous Xperia XZ2 models. But we're not moaning, the handset is still a worldie... It has a subtle curved back made from 3D glass, which is smooth to hold and fits nicely in your palm. You have a conveniently placed fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device too, for quick and easy access.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be pretty well protected; a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 back will act as an extra defence from knocks and drops, and a water resistance rating of IP68 means you can use your phone even when caught in the rain. Its rounded and sleek look is complemented with shiny aluminium frame around the whole device.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re all about the phone screen (perfect for Netflix in HD), this one is sure to wow an audience (it&rsquo;s the only way to describe the display on this Sony). You get a 4K resolution 5.8-inch screen, but not only that, you can enjoy Sony TRILUMINOS LCD tech in a pixel-packed and colourful display.</p>
<p>As you probably guessed, everything will look amazing on this phone. You&rsquo;ll be able to watch things like Netflix and YouTube in HDR too, streaming directly to your device. Nice, right? This Xperia has a big screen, not just in height but in width too, giving you even more screen to play with.</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>The cameras on this bad boy are no doubt one of its most impressive features. If, like Batman, you&rsquo;re the type of character who&rsquo;s often found out and about at night,&nbsp;you'll be please to hear the Xperia XZ2 Premium is a master of low light.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re shooting video or photos, the Xperia&rsquo;s 19-megapixel and 12-megapixel dual rear Motion Eye camera can handle it. Use the Bokeh photo feature for great portraits with blurred backgrounds and a whole host of other clever features to get your teeth into.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18570" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UT7eNYVJnUfUQDrFXvV9Owtw0mmGPN0Aq780KkmLq3yjDTcjvaZA705YRyPIp4j-8SP37PUt8UVDnXk5c3sRuC0=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>A 13-megapixel selfie camera will capture your best side, even in dark conditions, thanks to its low light camera sensor. Whatever the situation, you&rsquo;ll be able to bag that new profile pic or group selfie without a hitch.</p>
<p>Boss low light video too with 4K HDR recording, capable of capturing cinema-grade video, all from your Xperia smartphone. Use the super slow-motion video mode to capture those <em>LOL </em>moments with friends that are worth sharing online.</p>

<h2>Power and Performance</h2>
<p>Expect a smartphone masterclass from the Xperia XZ2 Premium and its innovative Sony technology. Boasting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset and 6GM RAM, this Xperia will constantly perform tasks fast and without a moments thought.</p>
<p>Mobile gaming and browsing apps will be a breeze too, as well as streaming and downloading, so be prepared to feed that Netflix addiction while you&rsquo;re out and about!

<p>With Android 8.0 Oreo installed on the Xperia XZ2 Premium, you'll have a fluid and easy-to-use operating system.</p>
<p>A 3540 mAh battery means you&rsquo;ve got plenty of juice to last you the day and with its quick charge capability, you&rsquo;ll be refuelled and on your way in no time. You can even top up via a wireless charger.</p>
