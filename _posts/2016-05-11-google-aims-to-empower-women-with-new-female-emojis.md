<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Google wants to increase the representation of women using the power of emoji</span></p>
<p>Employees at Google have submitted a proposal for a new range of female emojis, in an effort to reduce gender inequality in the work place.</p>
<p>The proposal claimed that the new emojis represent &ldquo;a wide range of professions for women and men with a goal of highlighting the diversity of women&rsquo;s careers and empowering girls everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professions depicted by the 13 submitted emojis include male and female forms of an office worker, doctor, nurse, scientist, graduate, software engineer, factory worker, industry worker, mechanic, farmer, chef, teacher and singer.</p>
<p>[URIS id=10442]</p>
<p>Existing emojis overlook large areas of industry, with male representation limited to police officers, detectives, construction workers and Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The situation for female representation causes more concern, though, with just the two emojis: a woman having a haircut, and a woman in a wedding dress.</p>
<p>The document submitted by Google workers quotes a popular op-ed piece from the New York Times, titled Emoji Feminism, posing the questions, &ldquo;Where was the fierce professor working her way to tenure? Where is the lawyer? The accountant? The surgeon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was there space for both a bento box and a single friend coconut shrimp, and yet women were restricted to a smattering of tired, beauty-centric roles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to approve the proposed emojis rests with the Unicode Consortium, a body made up of 11 voting members, which include Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook.</p>
<p>The Google workers involved are pushing for to have the new emojis standardised by the end of 2016, and added, &ldquo;We believe this will empower young women (the heaviest emoji users), and better reflect the pivotal roles women play in the world.&rdquo;</p>
