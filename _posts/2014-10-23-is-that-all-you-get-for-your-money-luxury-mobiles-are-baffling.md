<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new luxury phone has been unveiled in the shape of the Vertu for Bentley, which retails for a princely &pound;10,700. Join us as the author of this article breaks protocol by talking in the first person, to ask the question: what precisely do you get for your ten grand these days?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5871" alt="signature_touch_front_bentley_wht_v1di" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/signature_touch_front_bentley_wht_v1di.jpg" width="342" height="597" /></p>
<p>So, luxury phones, eh? There&rsquo;s a fairly high chance we&rsquo;ve all seen one at some point in our lives, even if we&rsquo;ve only ever seen photos of them online (because let&rsquo;s be honest, the chances of seeing one being owned by real people is remarkably slim).</p>
<p>Well a <i>new</i> luxury phone has just been announced, in conjunction with a luxury brand from the world of cars, and it baffles this author so much that he is... <i>I am</i> going to do something unusual and switch firmly to first person for this article.</p>
<p>The phone in question is the Vertu for Bentley, and like every luxury phone before it, it <i>completely</i> baffles me. The thing is that it&rsquo;s really rather expensive (and in fact, it&rsquo;s expensive even for a Vertu), coming in at a whopping <i>&pound;10,700</i>. That&rsquo;s, erm... yeah, that&rsquo;s ten grand, that is. That&rsquo;s the same price as the deposit on a <i>house</i> in some bits of the country (and to use a comparison that&rsquo;s a bit more appropriate for this site, it&rsquo;s equivalent to 16 times the price of buying a Samsung Galaxy S5 on a &pound;28 contract), so naturally, the next question is this: what precisely do you get for your money?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5872" alt="Vertu_3073330b" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Vertu_3073330b.jpg" width="620" height="387" /></p>
<p>The answer as far as I can see &ndash; and this might be why luxury phones baffle me &ndash; is <i>not very much at all, really</i>...</p>
<p>Internally, the Vertu for Bentley has a 2.3GHz processor, and 64Gb of storage, which is actually pretty decent, as luxury phones from the past were routinely not very good; the running joke was that the likes of Vertu were Nokia 3310s with posh frocks on. That screen has also been drastically improved, compared to older Vertu phones; the 1080p display comes in at 4.7-inches, which <i>could</i> actually allow us to class the Vertu for Bentley as a direct competitor to the iPhone 6.</p>
<p>So, basically, we&rsquo;ve reached the point where luxury phones like this, or the Tag Heuer Link, or the Mobiado Grand Touch, can finally mix it up on a technological level with top-end superphones like the LG G3, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. That means we can no longer <i>reflexively</i> say that they&rsquo;re worse than mainstream superphones, but the fact still remains that if you were to buy one, you&rsquo;d be paying 16 times the price, for a phone that, realistically, can only do the same things as a more reasonably-priced superphone.</p>
<p>So, what <i>are</i> you paying for with a luxury phone, then?</p>
<p>The official answer is &ldquo;design and craftsmanship&rdquo;, as each Vertu phone is handmade by a single craftsman within the company headquarters (as with some high-end cars, that person&rsquo;s signature is etched inside the phone). That craftsmanship is indeed <i>superlative</i>, as are the materials used (Newmarket Tan calf leather and titanium, for example), but I&rsquo;d debate whether it&rsquo;s <i>ten-grand-superlative</i>.</p>
<p>And as for the design, the <i>aesthetic</i>, I&rsquo;ll be nice and simply say that it&rsquo;s not really to my tastes. I&rsquo;ll stop short of outright calling it <i>gopping</i>...</p>
<p>I suppose that what each and every luxury phone-maker is doing, really, is selling an aspiration, albeit a <i>different</i> aspiration to the one that Apple&rsquo;s selling with its iPhone range. With Apple, the overriding message seems to be &ldquo;<i>look at this, isn&rsquo;t it cool, you want to be cool, don&rsquo;t you?</i>&rdquo;, whereas with Vertu, that message seems to be &ldquo;<i>look at you, all rich and powerful and awesome, a winner is you, you want something that fits your manly lifestyle!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very 80s, really, but since I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> rich, powerful or awesome, that might explain why luxury phones baffle me...</p>

<p><strong>So, all in all, should you buy a Vertu for Bentley? Well, no, clearly not, not even if you have a spare ten grand knocking about. No, I&rsquo;d get something like the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/lg/lg-g3-gold">LG G3</a> (best mobile screen <i>ever</i>) or the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-note-4-black">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a> (the S-Pen is seriously brilliant), save myself ten grand, and then have ten grand <i>and</i> a new phone to play with. That seems to be the more sensible option to me... </strong></p>
