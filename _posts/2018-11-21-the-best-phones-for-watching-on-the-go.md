<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Lions, and tigers, and&hellip; chimpanzees? Oh my!</span></p>
<p>Were you completely addicted to Planet Earth and Blue Planet II? If you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of those documentary series, there&rsquo;s a new show that you&rsquo;re going to go absolutely nuts over. Say hello to your new favourite show of 2018 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcearth.com/dynasties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynasties</a>.</p>
<h2>What is BBC&rsquo;s Dynasties?</h2>
<p>David Attenborough, much-beloved natural history expert, is back on the BBC once again. Hurrah! His latest documentary series casts its eye on an array of exotic animals as they take the first steps into the dangerous yet exciting realms of parenthood. Spoiler: It will also look at how humanity has played a role in the ever-changing animal world.</p>
<p>So, what can you expect? Well, each episode follows a different species and the 2018 show will include specials on chimpanzees, emperor penguins, hunting dogs, lions, and tigers. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s certain to be a <em>roaring</em> good time all around.</p>

<p>But, what if you missed the Sunday night show, you'll need to catch-up, right? For most of us, that could mean on our mobile phones during the morning commute or lunch break. So, here are the mobile phones that have the best screens for viewing your favourite catch-up TV.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best Phones to Watch Dynasties On?</h2>
<p>Ready to get started? In this list, we look at display size, image quality, brightness and screen resolution, to give you a clear idea of what each mobile offers. With all that in mind, here are the five best devices on which to binge this epic docu-series.</p>
<h5>5) Sony Xperia XZ3</h5>
<p>The Sony Xperia XZ3 has a seriously impressive screen. The 6-inch 1440 x 2880 OLED display just screams high-end, premium product. However, it&rsquo;s not just about the baseline specs here. The device has a clearer level of dynamic colour. That means that everything feels brighter and louder.</p>

Here, you&rsquo;ve got a healthy 2340 x 1080 resolution paired with a 6.41-inch AMOLED screen. All in all, it&rsquo;s hard to knock the display here. Who needs a TV screen when you&rsquo;ve got this device?</p>

<h5>3) Samsung Galaxy S9</h5>
<p>When it comes to the Samsung Galaxy S9 screen, one of the biggest things you will notice is that there&rsquo;s even more brightness. It&rsquo;s awesomely effective and not to be missed. Yes, this has been ramped up on this model. Add that to the 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display and you&rsquo;ve got a recipe for success.</p>
