<p><span class="postStandFirst">A mobile phone has helped to defuse a hostage crisis in the USA, thanks to the quick-thinking of Florida woman Cheryl Treadway, who hid a message for help in the comments box of the Pizza Hut app&rsquo;s order form.</span></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes said (usually half-jokingly) that mobile phones are lifesavers, and that they&rsquo;ll get you out of a bind if, for instance, your car breaks down. However, a mobile phone has played a more direct role in saving a life.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/06/us/florida-pizza-order-saves-mom/">CNN</a>, a mobile phone (and the Pizza Hut app on that phone) helped to end a potentially life-threatening hostage crisis in the States.</p>
<p>Florida woman Cheryl Treadway used the app in question to get herself and her three children out of a hostage situation with her boyfriend Ethan Nickerson, who was reportedly armed with a large knife.</p>
<p>In such a situation, calling 911 was not possible; Nickerson had confiscated Treadway&rsquo;s phone, and if she could get it back, calling the police would be too detectable, thus putting her in more danger.</p>
<p>So instead, Treadway asked for the phone back, and ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut, putting a message in the comments box that read &ldquo;Please help. Get 911 to me&rdquo; and further down the order form, one that read, &ldquo;911 hostage help!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Pizza Hut staff (who knew Treadway as a regular customer) then called 911, and as a result, the police were able to get Treadway and her children to safety, ending a potentially life-threatening crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Nickerson has been charged with aggravated assault with a weapon without intent to kill, battery, false imprisonment, and obstructing justice by depriving communication to law enforcement.</strong></p>
