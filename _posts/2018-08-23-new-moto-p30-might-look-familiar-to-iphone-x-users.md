<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Are you seeing double?</span></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Originality is a subjective thing. The late, great Elvis Presley took inspiration from a whole range of places. From blues singers to country stars, you&rsquo;ll find elements of many an artist in his music. And, let&rsquo;s be real, his tunes were awesome.</em></p>
<p>Since the iPhone X was announced last year, it&rsquo;s been a major hit. So, it should come as no surprise, that a few other phone makers have taken inspiration from this device. Some manufacturers have opted for a similar screen-style while others offer features close to the ones Apple offers. The latest company to get with this trend is none other than Moto.</p>
<p>The Lenovo-owned brand&rsquo;s latest phone, the Moto P30, certainly looks like something we&rsquo;ve all seen before. Taking heavy (okay, seriously heavy!) inspiration from the iPhone X, this device has an almost bezeless 6.2-inch Full HD+ IPS LCD display. Pretty snazzy.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s even a notch at the top of the device that looks somewhat similar to the notch you&rsquo;ll find on the latest iPhone. As though that wasn't enough to upset and enrage Apple devotees, the custom wallpaper is a colourful design similar to the one that the brand uses as standard for the iPhone X.</p>

<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s no way you could confuse the Moto P30 with the iPhone X. You just need to play a game of &lsquo;spot the difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Should you glance down to the bottom of the screen, you&rsquo;ll see one telltale sign that this is not the handy work of Apple. Yes, on the bottom of the phone, there&rsquo;s a clear logo that says &lsquo;Moto.&rsquo; Oh, and there&rsquo;s also a little &lsquo;M&rsquo; on the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>Of course, inspiration comes from a variety of places. When it comes to colour choices, the Moto P30 lineup includes an Aurora option &ndash; dazzling blue and purple style. Smartphone fans may notice that this one is strikingly similar to a colour choice that another brand offers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-twilight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P20 comes in Twilight</a>&hellip; which is basically the same as this latest tone from Moto. Oops.</p>
