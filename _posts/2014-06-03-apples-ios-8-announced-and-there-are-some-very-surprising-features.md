<div id="stcpDiv"><span class="postStandFirst">Apple's highly-anticipated iOS 8 announced recently, and to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the update includes a couple of features we thought we&rsquo;d never see on an iPhone, namely widgets (albeit only in the notification centre) and support for third-party keyboards (both of which are supported on Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5). Current iPhone users will be able to upgrade to iOS 8 (if they&rsquo;re using an iPhone 4s or newer) later in the year. </span></div>

<p>Just like its biggest rival, namely Android, iOS has a yearly update cycle, with each new year bringing a new version of Apple&rsquo;s smartphone platform. This year it&rsquo;s the turn of iOS 8, unveiled this week at Apple&rsquo;s Worldwide Developer Conference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turned out to be a surprising WWDC, as Apple had some <em>huge</em> surprises for us in this new version of iOS...</p>
<p>The first is widgets, something that Android phones (such as the recent Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8) have had since day one. Although these widgets will be confined to the drop-down notification centre (instead of being a core part of the homescreen experience as with Android), this is a feature that <em>no-one</em> was expecting Apple to unveil.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the only unexpected new feature, either, because Apple has announced that iOS 8 will <em>finally</em> bring support for third-party keyboards to the iPhone range! Again, this feature has existed in Android phones for a long time (and this fact has led many to say that iOS 8 is simply playing catch-up), but iOS 8 marks the first time where third-party keyboards like SwiftKey and Swype will be usable on Apple&rsquo;s smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Both of those developers have <em>also</em> announced that they are working on the iOS versions of those keyboards.</p>
<p>While those are the two most surprising additions, there were other new features unveiled, such as Healthkit and the Health app, Shazam integration in Siri, and interactive notifications.</p>
<p><strong>This new version of iOS will be available to install on the iPhone 4s or newer (so iPhone 5s users will be able to get their hands on it) later in the year, and it&rsquo;s certainly going to be interesting to see what the next iPhone does with all these new features. Stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
