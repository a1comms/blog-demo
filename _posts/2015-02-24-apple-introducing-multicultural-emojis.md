<p><span class="postStandFirst">Apple is in the process of releasing a beta of iOS 8.3, and one new feature in particular is grabbing a lot of headlines: once the update goes live, you will have access to wider range of multicultural emojis that better reflect the world we live in.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6273 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/02/emoji_fff.png" alt="Apple's new emojis" width="680" height="274" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you use a lot of emojis on your iPhone? You know, those little smiley faces that are perfect for summing up your mood, without any verbiage? Well you&rsquo;ve probably noticed the conspicuous lack of diversity then.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/23/apple-releases-ios-8-3-beta-2-for-iphone-ipad-to-developers/">9t05 Mac</a>, that&rsquo;s all about to change: the latest betas of both iOS 8.3 and OS X 10.10.3 have a new feature, whereby you can choose your emojis&rsquo; skin tone.</p>
<p>This move comes after news late in 2014, that the Unicode Consortium was working on increasing diversity in the emojis we use. Back then, Apple and Google put forward a proposal that would allow existing emojis to change skin tone, by adding a simple modifier into the text code used to generate those little smiley faces.</p>
<p>And so, when Apple releases the user-ready version of iOS 8.3, you&rsquo;ll finally find that your iPhone 6 (or, indeed, your iPhone 6 Plus) will better reflect the brilliant diversity of the world around you, and you&rsquo;ll be able to truly make it your own, with smileys <em>that actually bear more resemblance</em>!</p>
<p>Of course, there are other new features to get excited about, as well. There&rsquo;s a new wireless &ldquo;CarPlay&rdquo; feature (which will no doubt fuel even more rumours about Apple making a car), some improvements to the logins for Google services, and a raft of upgrades to Siri, including new voices, and the ability to understand new languages.</p>
<p><strong>At the moment, there&rsquo;s no date on when iOS 8.3 will come out of beta and be made available to all (not least because iOS 8.2 hasn&rsquo;t even been made fully available yet), but we shall be keeping a close eye on this one. </strong></p>
