<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Start training for the London Marathon 2019!</span></p>
<p>On Sunday, more than 50,000 people donned their running shoes and took to the busy streets to compete. Yes, we&rsquo;re talking about the London Marathon 2018.</p>
<p>Aside from being one of the hottest (thanks to our mini heatwave!) on record, the event also saw 34 people set brand-new Guinness World Records. Inspiring, right?</p>
<p>So, where were you? If you didn&rsquo;t quite make it past the finish line this year&hellip; or even to the start line, don&rsquo;t worry. There&rsquo;s always next year! Training early is key, so here are some of the best running apps that will help you train for the London Marathon 2019.</p>
<h2>1) RockMyRun</h2>
<p>Every run you decide to take needs a soundtrack. That&rsquo;s where RockMyRun comes into play. The app matches music to your speed and tempo, which should help to motivate you as you run.</p>
<p>As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the playlists here have been curated by some of the best DJs in the world. We&rsquo;re talking David Guetta, Major Lazer, and Afrojack. Nice.</p>

<p><em>Download RockMyRun for free: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/rockmyrun-workout-music-for/id546417608?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS app</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockmyrun.rockmyrun&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android app</a></em></p>
<h2>2) RunGo</h2>
<p>Planning out routes before you head for a city run is absolutely essential. You could just start running aimlessly, but that can be somewhat dangerous if you happen to be in a city environment.</p>
<p>RunGo is just the thing to help you out here. The app has a load of running routes for each city and gives you both a map and audio instructions. All you need to do is pop your headphones on and get going.</p>

<h2>3) Runkeeper</h2>
<p>Of course, when you&rsquo;re training, you need to keep track of your progress. While there are loads of fitness apps out there, Runkeeper is specifically designed for runners and could be perfect for you.</p>
<p>The app counts your calories, tracks your mileage, and gives you an accurate step-count too. It also works with devices such as your FitBit, Apple Watch, and Pebble smartwatch. What could be better?</p>

<h2>4) Runtastic</h2>
<p>Not only does this particular running app have an awesome name, it&rsquo;s also a pretty handy tool too. Like other apps of its kind, it tracks your runs and calories, but there&rsquo;s more to it than just that.</p>
<p>You can use Runtastic to set long-term goals too. This feature is ideal when training for the London Marathon 2019 as you can slowly build to your ideal speed.</p>

<h2>5) Strava</h2>
<p>Strava is a favourite among veteran runners and it&rsquo;s clear to see why. You can use the app as a social media site, uploading your recent routes and sharing your progress. That should help to keep you on track!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of training by yourself, you can use the app to find some local running groups. Oh, and it also works with a load of wearable tech too so it&rsquo;s ideal for serious athletes.</p>
