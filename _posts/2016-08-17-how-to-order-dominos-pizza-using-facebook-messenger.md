<p>Domino&rsquo;s Pizza is set on tackling hunger, hangovers and severe laziness in one quick fix, by creating a chatbot that allows customers to order pizza using just one word via Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Whilst the news might not be great for your bank balance or waistline, it does mean that the self-loathing level of fullness we all crave from Domino&rsquo;s is easier than ever to achieve.</p>

<p>You know you shouldn&rsquo;t read on. But you&rsquo;re going to anyway&hellip; How do I know?</p>
<p>Pizza. That&rsquo;s how.</p>
<h2>How to Set-up Pizza Ordering in Facebook Messenger</h2>
<p>1) Create an Easy Order account at Domino&rsquo;s and select your favourite pizza.</p>
<p>2) Pair your Easy Order account with your Facebook account.</p>
<p>3) Open Facebook Messenger, go to &lsquo;People&rsquo; and search for &lsquo;DOM&rsquo;. The account you&rsquo;re looking for should be listed under &lsquo;Bots and businesses&rsquo;.</p>
<p>4) Finally, message the word &lsquo;PIZZA&rsquo;, or simply the pizza emoji, to DOM The Pizza Bot, and confirm your order. Sit back, undo your belt buckle and attempt to contain yourself as your wait for the doorbell.</p>

<p>Next time you order from Domino&rsquo;s, you won&rsquo;t need to work through each step. Just open up Messenger and message &lsquo;PIZZA&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This could be dangerous, we know.</p>
<p>Nick Dutch, Head of Digital at Domino's, said, "We're delighted to allow our customers to order direct from Messenger &ndash; with one billion monthly active people using Messenger each month it's the obvious choice for Domino's.</p>
<p>"We want to make ordering our freshly handmade pizza as easy as possible so we&rsquo;re always on the look-out for new ways in which we can do this. Just message pizza or send an emoji, it really couldn't be easier.</p>
<p>Domino&rsquo;s Pizza isn&rsquo;t the only business currently developing chatbots for Facebook Messenger, in fact, there are more than 11,000 already out there. The idea is that these bots can intelligently communicate with customers, just like human customer service agents.</p>
<p>Is anybody actually still reading this? No, of course&nbsp;not. You&rsquo;re messaging DOM The Pizza Bot.</p>
