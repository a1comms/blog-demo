<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">From fancy new TVs, to self-driving pizza-delivering cars.</span></p>
<p>Arguably the biggest show in consumer and business technologies, CES 2018 was a chance for us all to take a sneak peek at what the future holds.</p>
<p>While there were countless gadgets and devices on display, some deserve a special mention. Here are the most exciting, intriguing, and mind-blowing highlights of CES 2018.</p>
<h2>Wearable Tech: L&rsquo;Oreal UV Sense</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agj10Kbvp-4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;re all aware of the harmful effects that UV rays can yield. Even the most dedicated of sun worshippers have recently seen the light (pun intended), and are attempting to change their ways. But how much sun is too much?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the very question that L&rsquo;Oreal wants to help answer. The UV Sense is a tiny wearable device which attaches to your fingernail. The sensor monitors your UV exposure and swiftly sends the information back to your phone. It&rsquo;s a novel use for wearable tech and one with obvious health benefits.</p>
<h2>Home Theatre: Optoma 4K Alexa Projector</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16256" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MmFJZbBxJrc6KJ2DJKUHQCWFOzAW8RXChMA3gKaEbvz2L3gBDxq5vVGI5VvU-slcHTqxtVJh3hnj9ARfWC5U5Ytu=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spoiler: Home projectors could very well be the future of entertainment. These little devices may be the way forward and could see many of us waving a long goodbye to our flat screen TVs.</p>
<p>The Optoma HD51A is one of the most sophisticated in its field, and comes at a rather affordable price. Oh, and it uses the Alexa voice command system so you don&rsquo;t even need to use a remote control. &ldquo;Alexa, play Star Wars, please?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Cool Robot: Sony AIBO</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJoAcEI2PXQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t want a robot dog? Sony is back yet again with an offering in this niche. The AIBO is a connected, smart device that is novel as well as useful. The futuristic pet has OLED eyes, an onboard camera, and a whole host of connectivity options.</p>
<p>Oh, and it looks utterly adorable, which has to be a major bonus here too.</p>
<h2>Gaming Tech: HTC Vive Pro</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPMJDXmYwiY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already familiar with the HTC Vive, the latest update is sure to be of real interest. The Pro edition offers a little more to users, including 3D audio capabilities, a snazzy new resolution (2,880 x 1,600), dual front-facing cameras, and two mics to boot.</p>
<p>All the above is sure to excite gamers who are already on board with the VR trend. Right now, there&rsquo;s no telling how far this type of tech could go. The small changes to the original show real progression in headset gaming. Watch this space.</p>
<h2>Futuristic Fitness: Black Box VR</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fblackboxvrfitness%2Fvideos%2F2003649216575313%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=600" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Start-up&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/black-box-vr-wants-to-help-games-get-fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Box VR</a>&nbsp;is all set to create the gym of the future. Rather than merely heading to a space, filled with exercise machines and the like, we may soon be going to small rooms to exercise alone. The idea is that fitness lovers use the HTC Vive headset to complete a gamified workout.</p>
<p>Users will compete against an avatar, and then later against other users, to train as hard as they can. What&rsquo;s more, there will be local leader boards that users can score on, adding a strong level of competition to the experience.</p>
<h2>Improved Tech: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwNTWb8s97o" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Boosting the Thinkpad X1 line, Lenovo has added a few little extras to the PC-come-tablet that we all know and love by now. The latest incarnation of the device has a built-in privacy shutter and twin mics, which offer some seriously impressive voice control capabilities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the addition of a brand-new keyboard, the Dolby Vision HDR display, and an embedded eSIM. Plus, the device is soon to have Alexa available on it too. Nicely done.</p>
<h2>Transportation: Toyota e-Palette</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16255" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y1T5d2UxJ8lMSWCJSGvvF8NafFL-HIT8AhnkdFHsW3qfoyFgARQ_i77-6AGWBnBZq1ChnwIBYdBUtDjAR_ktpU0d=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Driverless cars are sure to dominate the roads of the future, but what does that mean for the realms of retailing and business? Toyota is one of the first manufacturers to envision how these vehicles may be used by some of the world&rsquo;s leading brands. The e-Palette is set to "blur the lines between brick and mortar and online commerce."</p>
<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a small, cabin-like vehicle which can be transformed into whatever a company may need. The possibilities really are limitless here. For example, it may well be used as a pizza delivery cart or maybe even a portable office.</p>
<h2>Sports Gear: Prevention Biometrics Head Impact Monitor System (HIMS)</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xop_Zx3xT3E" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Prevention Biometrics is a company set on taking the mouth guard to the very next level. That&rsquo;s where the Head Impact Monitor System (HIMS) comes into play. This tiny little device has built-in sensors and connectivity abilities. The idea is that athletes wear the guard and, in the case of a dangerous collision, it alerts medical staff to the problem.</p>
<p>In theory, this could turn out to be a life-saving piece of equipment, which allows sports professionals to get the medical help that they need as soon as possible. So, making those injury response times as fast as possible is a truly noble goal.</p>
<h2>Home Product: Lenovo Smart Display</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16257" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wrTaGBMwt3WAQ-6Kbd9r0c1VdAwxwoUCceLGaMYdASstltW9qwDq8Dpe4UWGiyh2oSxoVBuA-LODIFBIw-NrsT20=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Joining the ranks of the Echo Show and other connected home products, there&rsquo;s the Lenovo Smart Display. The smart little device uses Google Assistant to allow users to control things in their home, ask for help, and play music. The whole shebang. While it&rsquo;s by no means revolutionary in concept, it&rsquo;s touted to be one of the best of its kind. That could mean big things for it in the future.</p>
<h2>Multipurpose Tech: Lenovo Miix 630</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16258" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bvlAfv8cnM02C7EvbnriMYrlG5mEBry-FltAqeME-OHoYql-tHiE5kxlLgZYRwINJ4HprIwz2UMjlnxJspFjjwbWKQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Portable technology has come a long, long way since the laptops of the mid-2000s. These days, devices are lighter, faster and last longer than ever before. A perfect example of just that comes in the form of the Lenovo Miix 630 tablet.</p>
<p>This Windows 2-in-1 device runs a Snapdragon 835 chipset, like the one in top-end smartphones. That means that it&rsquo;s one of the most impressive and fastest devices of its time. It also has a rather neat little keyboard to make working on-the-go simple.</p>
<h2>New TV: LG 2018 C-Series OLED</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16259" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6dlKuDluw3WHy6fA2d59pv67tAtiEu53AgNPvTtnbcQOKFcCQOSsqTjh-Q6QI95vVqaJ9ohb5kikkgTDAIqZBj5P=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still something to be said for smart TVs and these devices are only getting fancier as time goes on. LG&rsquo;s C8-series took pride of place at the CES 2018 exhibit and for good reason. The latest devices come complete with Google Assistant and a snazzy new Alpha 9 processor. Working with the likes of Google, this is a sure-fire sign that LG&rsquo;s TVs are only going from strength to strength. Nice.</p>
<h2>Little Extra: My Special Aflac Duck</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16260" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5LHs5Ps3vkqewVxrSZm_yOyX8Z8NmmFoBAFyz5_WDT2JGCzxYqUtigN9Nn6ugxwtVQxaXXwDkNPC06Kz4KekKmo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While it may be surprising to see a cuddly toy at a gadget show, this is a stuffed duck with a difference. My Special Aflac Duck is cute to look at and fluffy to touch, but that&rsquo;s by no means all that it has to offer. It&rsquo;s actually designed with the specific purpose of supporting children who have been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>To do just that, it comes complete with emoji cards, which should help the children to express their emotions, and a port-a-cath with an RFID chip, which will familiarise them with chemotherapy. The company&rsquo;s plan is to offer the duck to kids with cancer around the US free of charge.</p>
