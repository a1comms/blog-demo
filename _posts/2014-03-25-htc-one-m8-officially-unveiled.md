<p><span class="postStandFirst">For months, there have been rumours about the phone codenamed HTC M8, and they&rsquo;ve painted a picture of a truly magnificent superphone. Now, though, the phone has been officially unveiled, and oh boy, does it live up to the hype!</span></p>
<p>Thankfully, it also seems that HTC has gone with a sensible name for their newest superphone; instead of the oft-rumoured &ldquo;All New HTC One&rdquo;, HTC&rsquo;s new flagship, as shown at the official launch event, is known as the&nbsp;HTC One M8.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/13408513915_4cb619ce1a.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The first change, compared to last year&rsquo;s HTC One, is in the design. Although both phones share a similar design ethos, the body shell on the HTC One M8 is now made of 90% metal, giving it an amazing premium feel. At the same time, the 1080p screen is now 5-inches from corner to corner. In terms of internal hardware, you&rsquo;re looking at a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor and, for the first time in over two years, a microSD slot!</p>

<p>Oh, and there&rsquo;s a new version of the Sense UI (although it still comes with BlinkFeed, naturally), namely version 6, or as HTC brilliantly likes to call it, the Sixth Sense.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s the Duo Camera which is the most exciting part. The HTC One M8 uses an UltraPixel camera, as did its predecessor, but the difference is that this camera has&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;lenses. And yes, as expected, that allows you to change the focus of a photo,&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve taken it!</p>
<p><strong>So, in short, the HTC One M8 has been announced, and it looks&nbsp;<em>awesome</em>; expect a full run-down of just&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;awesome very soon!</strong></p>
