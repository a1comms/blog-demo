<p><span class="postStandFirst">We're just one week away from the unveiling of the HTC One M8, previously known as the HTC M8 and the All New HTC One. It's time to take a look at the rumours so far, and see if we can take a guess at how great the HTC One M8 will be!</span></p>
<p>It goes without saying that it&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;be awesome, of course; the only question is:&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;awesome?</p>
<h2>Design - The Glory Of Metal</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/13263232654_98a518d089.jpg" width="500" height="376" /><span class="caption">The HTC One features a fantastic all-metal design</span></p>
<p>The original&nbsp;HTC One&nbsp;is a beautiful phone, clad in a polycarbonate-accented metal shell that looks gorgeous, and feels fantastic to hold. HTC hit on a winning formula with this phone, and since it&rsquo;s always a good idea to&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;fix what <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> broken, we can expect more of the same from the All New HTC One, or HTC One M8.</p>
<p>However, the metal shell will purportedly feature a much stronger texture, making the phone look more &ldquo;intense&rdquo; than its predecessor. Combined with a 5-inch 1080p screen, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that the HTC One M8 will be a stunner!</p>
<h2>Interface - Sense 6.0</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2839/11066333583_abca4d4f3e.jpg" width="388" height="325" /></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption">The HTC Sense 6.0 user interface not only looks great, it's easy to use.</span></p>
<p>Alongside those changes in the design, HTC&rsquo;s Sense user interface has also been given an overhaul, albeit only a slight one. BlinkFeed is still present and correct, as is the vertically scrolling app drawer, but there are a couple of noteworthy changes.</p>
<p>Firstly, icons have been given the once-over with the flattening tool, similar to when iOS was redesigned for version 7 (as seen in the iPhone 5s). Secondly, support seems to have been added for &ldquo;Motion Launch gestures&rdquo;, allowing for things like double-tapping the screen to wake up the phone.</p>
<h2>Hardware - Phenomenal Cosmic Power</h2>
<p>Things are pretty much as everyone expected in this category, as the All New HTC One has a Snapdragon 801 processor, the same as is found in the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Sony Xperia Z2, which is purportedly clocked to 2.3GHz.</p>
<p>More exciting than that, however, is the fact that HTC has once again made a flagship phone with a microSD slot, something that they haven&rsquo;t done for over two years! While the All New HTC One is said to come with 16GB of onboard storage, the return of the microSD slot to HTC&rsquo;s flagship range is a very welcome sight indeed!</p>
<h2>The Real Innovation - &ldquo;Duo&rdquo; Camera</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/13262880095_ca07c5ac7a.jpg" width="471" height="383" /><span class="caption">The HTC One features a phenomenal UltraPixel camera and HTC Zoe</span></p>
<p>By far the most exciting part about the All New HTC One, more exciting than anything mentioned so far, is its &ldquo;Duo&rdquo; camera. As the name suggests, the All New HTC One in fact has&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;cameras on the back, which will lead to better low light performance and cleaner images, but the excitement over the Duo camera runs deeper than that.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s also rumoured that this Duo camera will allow &ldquo;Duo effects&rdquo; to be applied to any photo you take. While it&rsquo;s not confirmed what these actually are, the likeliest possibility is that it will allow you to do things like change the focus of a photo after it&rsquo;s been taken.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said it before, and we&rsquo;ll say it again: that&rsquo;s not technology, that&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>sorcery</em>!</p>
<p><strong>And so, we can say with some certainty that next week is going to be very exciting&nbsp;<em>indeed</em>. We cannot wait to get our hands on one of these!</strong></p>
