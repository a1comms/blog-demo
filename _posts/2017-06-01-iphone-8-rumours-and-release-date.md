<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Updated 01.06.17: All the biggest 'iPhone 8' rumours from around the web!</span></p>
<p>iPhone 7&nbsp;isn't far from reaching its one-year birthday, which means Apple fans itching for the next iPhone launch, rumoured to be called 'iPhone 8' according to online sources like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-8/">MacRumours</a>.</p>
<p>Saying that, some reports claim that Apple could be ditching the number naming format altogether, in favour of something entirely different. More on that later.</p>
<p>This year will mark the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone launch. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s likely that Apple will want to make some rather dramatic changes, showing us just how far the world&rsquo;s most popular smartphone has come.</p>
<p>What can we expect from 'iPhone 8'? These are the most interesting rumours from around the web.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Release Date</h2>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;ve got no official word on the release date - Apple's giving nothing away&nbsp;- it doesn&rsquo;t require a crystal ball to predict an 'iPhone 8' launch date.</p>
<p>Apple usually announces its flagship smartphones in the second or third week of September. In fact, Apple has followed this exact pattern for several years now, so it&rsquo;s only logical to presume we&rsquo;ll get the first glimpse of 'iPhone 8' then.</p>
<h2>iPhone 8 Hottest Leaks</h2>
<p>Every year, pretty much from the moment an iPhone is launched, rumours and leaks of its successor start&nbsp;flooding the news. The story's no different for 'iPhone 8'. As always, we'd recommend taking any leaks with a pinch of salt, at we've seen countless bits of FAKE NEWS over the years. But here are some particularly interesting leaks from around the web.</p>
<p>9to5 Mac -&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/02/iphone-8-leaked-images-rear-touch-id/" target="_blank">Leaked iPhone 8 images claim to show rear Touch ID, bezel-less design,&nbsp;more</a></p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Design Rumours</h2>
<p>While&nbsp;in recent years we haven&rsquo;t seen all that much change in the way of design (not to discount the waterproof build on iPhone 7), we do have reason to believe that this year could be different.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZjVYoeMLf1k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The tenth anniversary of iPhone would be the ideal time to take on a complete overhaul. So far, there have been some pretty interesting reports that provide just a hint of how 'iPhone 8' may look.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-8-1329124">TechRadar</a>, Apple might be ditching the aluminium unibody in favour of an all-glass design. Though it might retain a metal frame for extra strength, like Samsung Galaxy S7 edge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12940" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/iphone-7-silver.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420" /></p>
<p>Ming-Chi Kuo, CEO of the company that produces iPhone cases, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/the-iphone-7s-could-have-a-glass-back-just-like-the-galaxy-s7-1321829">has openly admitted</a> that Apple "will adopt glass casing" in 2017.</p>
<p>While there are numerous 'iPhone 8' rumours out there, one that will intrigue Apple fans more than most, is the one that proposes that Apple is removing the home button. Yes, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/15/iphone-8-function-area/">9 to 5 Mac</a> seems confident that the much-loved, iPhone-defining home button could become a relic of the past.</p>
<p>Some sources have suggested that 'iPhone 8' will instead feature Touch ID integrated into the screen.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Name</h2>
<p>Technically, we should be getting an iPhone 7s this year, but the web is insisting that 2017 will see a huge upgrade for iPhone. One that warrants its own new number. Or, perhaps, an entirely new naming format. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/forget-the-iphone-8-apple-might-be-making-an-iphone-x">TechRadar</a> thinks that Apple might be launching an 'iPhone X' (as in the Roman numeral for 10 - this year marks iPhone's 10th anniversary).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfpAiY3QqL4?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>iPhone 8 Camera Rumours</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a rather snazzy dual-lens camera exclusively on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-7-plus-32gb-black">iPhone 7 Plus</a>&nbsp;(that creates an arty depth-of-field effect - see image below), and some sources, like <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/iphone/iphone-8-latest-rumours-uk-release-date-delays-3639808/">Macworld</a>, are claiming that both the smaller and larger 'iPhone 8' could boast the same. As well as some other impressive camera features to stand out from the crowd...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12692" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/portrait-mode.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="328" /></p>
<p>Like augmented reality (AR), a feature that could allow 'iPhone 8' to recognise objects when you take pictures, and a <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/iphone/iphone-8-latest-rumours-uk-release-date-delays-3639808/">3D photographing module</a> that adds three-dimensional effects. Is there much weight to these rumours? It&rsquo;s too early to say.</p>
<p>With the current megapixel count standing at 12MP, Apple may want&nbsp;to bump this up. Although it&rsquo;s not vital.</p>
<h2>iPhone 8 Power Rumours</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. iPhone 7 was something of a game-changer in terms of power. Boasting an impressive quad-core chip, Apple will have its work cut out to out-perform it with the 'iPhone 8'.</p>
<p>But we know it will, because if anyone loves a challenge, it&rsquo;s Apple. So, if CNET is anything to go by, expect 'iPhone 8' to house an <a href="https://www.cnet.com/uk/products/apple-iphone-8/preview/">A11 or an A11 Fusion chip</a>, and either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. In terms of the user experience, what that means is you&rsquo;ll be able to juggle different apps, play the latest games and watch videos without any interruptions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12943" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/iphone-7-a10-chip.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420" /></p>
<p>As for the operating system, there haven&rsquo;t been any rumours about it just yet. However, given the fact that iOS 10 recently launched in tandem with iPhone 7, it would be safe to assume that the next iPhone will surface with <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/ios-11-rumours-and-release-date">iOS 11</a>.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Rumoured Features</h2>
<p>Aside from the obvious, what delights will 'iPhone 8' be capable of? We might not know just what Apple has in mind, but we can take an educated guess at some new iPhone features we&rsquo;ll see come September 2017.</p>
<p>One of the hottest TechRadar rumours is that the phone will have some <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-8-1329124">brand new sensory features</a>. In fact, a source has claimed that you&rsquo;ll be able to touch the side of the device to take it out of sleep mode in an instant. This system may also be used to change the brightness of the phone, or even take a sneaky photo in an instant.</p>
<p>Since our lives are mostly stored in these tiny devices, Apple may also increase the security on 'iPhone 8'. There has been talk of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/10/iphone-8-iris-scanner-digitimes-rumor/">iris scanner</a>, from MacRumours, that&rsquo;ll allow you to unlock the device and access other features. That, combined with on-screen Touch ID, would make 'iPhone 8' something of a fortress.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Display Rumours</h2>
<p>You may have heard the rumour, as reported on Fortune, that the upcoming iPhone will have a <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/apple-iphone-curved-oled-screen/">curved AMOLED display</a>. While that may still very much be an option, the latest 'iPhone 8' news suggests that it&rsquo;s not set in stone just yet. In fact, some sources are now claiming that this screen style is just one of many prototypes Apple&rsquo;s considering.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12944" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/iphone-7-display.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="293" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a possibility that 'iPhone 8' will feature a curved&nbsp;<em>plastic</em>&nbsp;screen instead, presumably because it&rsquo;s less likely to shatter. According to Apple Insider, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/12/18/all-of-apples-oled-iphone-8-models-to-use-curved-samsung-panels---report">Apple has bought a batch of curved plastic OLED panels from the likes of Samsung</a>. It sounds like the guys at Apple are exploring their screen and display options.</p>
<h2>iPhone 8 Pricing Rumours</h2>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s talk money. If you&rsquo;re hoping to nab yourself an 'iPhone 8' in September, how many pennies will you need to save in the meantime?</p>
<p>We honestly won&rsquo;t know how much the 'iPhone 8' will cost until it&rsquo;s official release. However, the likelihood is that Apple would set the price at a similar mark as the recent iPhone 7. You can expect the phone&rsquo;s starting price to be around &pound;599, which will increase depending on the spec of the phone.</p>
