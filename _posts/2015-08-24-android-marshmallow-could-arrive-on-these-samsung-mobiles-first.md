<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sorry, older Samsung mobiles, this might not include you.</span></p>
<p>In the wake of Google unveiling its appetising OS update, Android Marshmallow, an &lsquo;insider&rsquo; has revealed which Samsung mobile phones may be first in the queue to get it.</p>
<p>Speaking to YouMobile, the informer claimed that Samsung would begin rolling Android Marshmallow to select devices in early 2016, once it finishes dishing out Android Lollipop 5.1.1.</p>
<p>Those privileged enough to make the Android M update list, allegedly include the recently announced Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+, as well as Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.</p>
<p>The same report also reveals that Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy Alpha are also in line for Google&rsquo;s latest update, albeit somewhere further off in the future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not too sure what Android Marshmallow is, or why you should be excited about it, check out Samsung&rsquo;s informative&nbsp;infographic below (click it to enlarge).</p>

<p><strong>To clarify, nothing reported here is official, though the handsets divulged&nbsp;by the tipster are all pretty reasonable candidates for the&nbsp;Android&nbsp;M&nbsp;update.</strong></p>
