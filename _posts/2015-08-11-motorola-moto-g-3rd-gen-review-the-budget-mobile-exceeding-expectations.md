<p><span class="postStandFirst">Motorola&rsquo;s Moto G is&nbsp;exceeding every expectation, through an advanced camera, remarkable display and reassuring build.</span></p>
<p>When we talk about Motorola, many tend to think back to the iconic RAZR the company became so strongly associated with, upon its launch in 2004.</p>
<p>However, a series of new releases suggest a return to form; it feels like Motorola is rejuvenating its once revered brand.</p>
<p>This is particularly true after the launch of the ambitious, super-durable Motorola Moto G - the third generation in the series.</p>
<p>Simply put, it&rsquo;s a budget attempt at a high-end smartphone, proving that Motorola still has a heck of a lot to bring to the mobile industry.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Design</strong></span></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the &lsquo;tech specs&rsquo; of a smartphone are becoming far less of a concern for those style-conscious consumers. The Moto G recognises this, combining a slick all-black primary colour with a distinctive silver edge, while still weighing only 155 grams.</p>
<p>The natural curvature of the phone looks pleasing and, in theory, should create a comfortable experience. But the subtle ridges on the rear are a little difficult to grip at times.</p>
<p>Despite that minor shortcoming, the structure and solidity are&nbsp;fantastic. Complete with an IPX-7 rating, something all the specs gurus will understand, the Moto G is equipped to survive the nightmare so many of us have experienced - dropping our phones into some form of liquid.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7650 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_Black_Front_Underwater.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_Black_Front_Underwater.jpg alt=&rdquo;Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) is water-resistant&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="534" data-id="7650" /></p>
<p>By using advanced water-protection technology, the Motorola Moto G has emerged as one of the leading phones for combating water damage. It can (remarkably) survive being dropped in up to three feet of water, so those heart-stopping moments when you drop your mobile into the bath aren&rsquo;t such a big deal.</p>
<p>Even more surprising is the fact that the device can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. What Motorola might have lost in the feel of the phone, it has made up for with a highly impressive level of resilience. Still, probably best not to take it swimming&hellip;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Display</strong></span></h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important elements of a modern day smartphone is a quality, sizable screen. The Moto G has met that standard, measuring in at 5-inches.</p>
<p>The HD (720p) resolution creates a crisp image, more so than you might expect, and colours look vibrant and the dark tones appear subtle, yet powerful.</p>
<p>This all comes together to create a pleasant experience and one which exceeds expectations based on the budget price tag.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7652 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_White_Front_Soccer.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_White_Front_Soccer.jpg alt=&rdquo;Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) has a 720p HD display&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="533" data-id="7652" /></p>
<p>The low pixel density of 294 pixels per inch, however, means your favourite photos might not have that level of detail you desire.</p>
<p>Due to its strong screen size, viewing videos isn't a problem for the Motorola Moto G. Although, you might want to spare long movies if you&rsquo;re used to the likes of Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>One reproach is the unnecessary additional space for speakers at the bottom of the phone, where perhaps a bigger screen could have been implemented. But that&rsquo;s nothing; the overall display experience really can&rsquo;t be met with anything other than strong approval.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Camera</strong></span></h2>
<p>Possibly the biggest selling point of the Moto G is the impressive camera. Motorola has sent out a real statement of intent to its competitors, making the best-in-class camera and showcasing just what it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>
<p>The camera itself will capture shots in great detail, helped by the 13-megapixels it&rsquo;s working with. You can be confident that you can capture the best snaps when you need them, because it takes just two seconds to launch the snapper from the lock screen.</p>
<p>The Moto G&nbsp;also sports a number of unique features, such as the ability to open the camera just by twisting your wrist quickly.</p>
<p>By being able to change the focus and exposure by simply swiping your finger up and down the screen, you can be confident that your photos will always come out looking as you would want them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the wide range of editing tools, there&rsquo;s no need to worry even if they don&rsquo;t come out as expected. From saturation increase to funky filters, it&rsquo;s easy to retouch any blemishes you find.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7653 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_White_Back_Pink_Shell.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/08/Moto_G_White_Back_Pink_Shell.jpg alt=&rdquo;Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) features an epic 13MP camera&rdquo;/>" width="800" height="439" data-id="7653" /></p>
<p>Adding to the already impressive feature set is a 5-megapixel front camera, ensuring high quality selfies are on tap.</p>
<p>Video on the Motorola Moto G is also surprisingly advanced, shooting in 1080p, and leaving little between itself and some of the leading smartphones. And sharing video is made easy, something Android has always been sure to keep simple.</p>
<p>Motorola has evolved the features on its camera with the introduction of slow motion video &ndash; which is sure to be a hit with the creative types.</p>
<p>Overall, the camera suits all parties, those used to extreme quality and even those who haven&rsquo;t heard of a &lsquo;megapixel&rsquo; before. It&rsquo;s intuitively simple and effective to use.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>System and power</strong></span></h2>
<p>The Moto G harnesses the full capabilities of Android Lollipop 5.1.1, and packs a strong quad-core 1.4 GHz processor. This results in a smooth performance that maintains speed and rarely demonstrates any signs of slowing down. The 1GB RAM helps ensure that the speed is kept up to desired levels.</p>
<p>The battery life, based on the strong processor, should in theory be rather low, but is in fact the opposite. The Moto G is capable of yielding up to 24 hours of mixed usage, though you can expect less than that if you&rsquo;re watching HD movies.</p>
<p>The storage&nbsp;size is a slightly disappointing 8GB, so you may find yourself deleting stuff more than you&rsquo;d like to. But don&rsquo;t fret too much, you can still add up to 32GB of external memory, via a microSD card.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0397d6;"><strong>Verdict</strong></span></h2>
<p>To conclude, Motorola has demonstrated a serious ambition to return to previous heights. The Motorola Moto G is a statement of intent to the other budget phones and, perhaps, even to the premium smartphones.</p>
<p>The excellent build of the phone and strong camera quality sets it apart from rivals, and is perhaps the phone to spark Motorola back into life.</p>
