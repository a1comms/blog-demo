<h2>1. 7 Minute Workout</h2>
<p>Getting fit and healthy can be a struggle at the best of times. When you&rsquo;ve got to make dinner, binge-watch Netflix, and shower before bed, it hardly feels that you have time to also workout. Well, surely, you can spare a mere seven minutes of your day, right? That&rsquo;s where the 7 Minute Workout app comes into play. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded this free iOS app, you just have to press &lsquo;Start workout&rsquo; and away you go.

<h2>2. Soundcloud</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a music lover, there&rsquo;s a whole host of essential iPhone apps that you seriously need. One that you must never skip is Soundcloud. The app allows you to find &lsquo;streams&rsquo; of music from artists all around the globe.

<h2>3. Shazam</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when you hear a song on the radio but just can&rsquo;t place it? It&rsquo;s annoying, right? If you don&rsquo;t figure out what the tune happens to be, you&rsquo;ll likely have to walk around with it in your head for the rest of the day. Luckily, Shazam has the answer just for you. Simply hold your phone up to the speaker, hold down the button for a few seconds, and away you go. The free iOS app will tell you just what the track is along with useful information like where you can buy it.</p>

<h2>4. UberEATS</h2>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re all used to using Uber to get around these days, but the team can do even more than that. UberEATS is an easy way to get the food you love, delivered right to your door. Sadly, the service is only available in major cities at the moment, but the team promise that they are expanding soon so you may just have to hold on a while. The app links drivers with local restaurants so that you can get a freshly cooked meal whenever, wherever you like.</p>

<h2>5. Vivino</h2>
<p>Calling all wine lovers! This is the app for you. Buying a bottle of vino from the supermarket can be a risk at the best of times! If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you likely just go with the label that looks the best or, at least, the oldest. Well, now you no longer have to guess which wine is worth your money. All you need to do is use the Vivino app to take a picture of the wine. After just a few seconds, the app will tell you what the wine is, how much the average cost of it should be, and shows a load of user reviews too.</p>

<h2>6. Tiny Scanner</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest for a moment here. No one, in this day and age, actually owns a scanner. Those things are relics of a long forgotten era, AKA the 90s. Still, you may find that you need to scan important documents from time to time in your daily life. This will present you with something of a problem. Luckily, Tiny Scanner has just the answer to your prayers. Just take a snap of the document on your phone and the essential iOS app will convert the picture into PDF format so that you can send it to anyone, anywhere!</p>
<p><b>Download </b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tiny-scanner-pdf-scanner-to-scan-document-receipt-fax/id595563753?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Tiny Scanner</b></a><b> here</b></p>
<h2>7. Gumtree</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re trying to sell your old lawnmower or just looking for new members for your band, there&rsquo;s only one place you need to look. Gumtree has been the online equivalent to the classified ads section for quite some time now. What you may not know, though, is that you can download an iPhone app version of this forum. Yes, with just the click of a button, you will have access to a world of adverts and posts. Go nuts!</p>
<p><b>Download </b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gumtree-classifieds-buy-sell-local-for-sale/id487946174?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Gumtree</b></a><b> here</b></p>
<h2>8. Virgin Trains</h2>
<p>If you happen to travel around the country by train a whole lot, you really cannot go wrong with the Virgin Trains app. This has to be one of the most essential free iPhone apps out there right now. Once you&rsquo;ve signed into your Virgin account, you can buy tickets, check train times, and even look up live station boards anywhere in the country. While we all know that traveling can be a whole load of hassle, this little app should make it just a tad easier!</p>
<p><b>Download </b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/virgin-trains-tickets/id432543015?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>Virgin Trains</b></a><b> here</b></p>
<h2>9. Bandsintown</h2>
<p>If you always feel as though you miss your chance to nab the latest gig tickets, this is the essential iOS app for you. Bandsintown links with your Spotify playlist and figures out what acts you like (along with a load that you may like but haven&rsquo;t heard of yet!). It then gives you live notifications when the bands you love are playing near you. That means that you will be the first to know when your fave artist announces a tour so you&rsquo;ll definitely get tickets! Result.</p>

<h2>10. Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter has come a long way since it launched way back in 2006. These days, it&rsquo;s one of the best places to find out the latest news, get the inside scoop, and follow some influential people. If you&rsquo;re a huge fan of the 140-character social media platform, getting the app really is the next logical step. Downloading the free iOS app means that you will have access to all the best tweets no matter where you are or what you&rsquo;re doing. You know it makes sense!</p>
