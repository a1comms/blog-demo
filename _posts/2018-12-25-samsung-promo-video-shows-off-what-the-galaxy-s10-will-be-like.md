<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here&rsquo;s what you can expect from One UI!</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/the-rumoured-samsung-galaxy-s10-could-come-in-three-versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumoured Samsung Galaxy S10</a> probably won&rsquo;t be hitting stores until early 2019. But, hey, that&rsquo;s not going to stop us speculating about what the flagship phone could be packing.</p>
<p>Luckily, we don&rsquo;t have to play the guessing game for much longer. Samsung has helped us out here with a sneaky video featuring its upcoming user interface.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3LVk0i6bY4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The interface will be called One UI, and it looks seriously impressive in the teaser clip. The current version is Samsung Experience, which you will find on most modern Samsung handsets.</p>
<p>The new and upcoming interface has a whole range of cool upgrades and features that we simply can&rsquo;t wait to get our hands on.</p>
<p>So, what can we expect from the One UI interface? Well, the video doesn&rsquo;t give everything away at once. However, there are a few hints that we can try to unwrap. Check them out here:</p>
<h2>Physical Design Echoed in Software</h2>
<p>First of all, the clip claims that it will have its &lsquo;physical design echoed in software&rsquo; and appears to show a red light around the rim of the device. It could be that Samsung is planning to put a light on the hardware of the device, which will interact with the UI.</p>
<h2>Interact Naturally</h2>
<p>The video also says that users will be able to &lsquo;interact naturally&rsquo; and shows a new and improved search function. That handy-looking feature may allow you to choose where you&rsquo;re searching, i.e. in Contacts or Places etc. That could mean that it&rsquo;s easier to find what you need within your phone quicker than ever.</p>

<h2>Be Visibly Comfortable</h2>
<p>Plus, as though that wasn&rsquo;t enough, it appears that you will also be able to change the look of your interface to suit your surroundings. For example, you could be able to switch your phone to day or night mode, making it bright or dark. From the video, it looks as though this feature will be intuitive, changing with the light around you.</p>
<h2>Made to Focus</h2>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;made to focus&rsquo; promise, which teases the idea that the newer user interface will have an altogether cleaner and more minimal-looking style. That&rsquo;s something that we can all get behind and it&rsquo;s also the way most smartphone interfaces are going.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, it all sounds pretty darn impressive. The One UI interface has already been released in beta for developers. However, the chances of it being released for everyone before the Galaxy S10&rsquo;s release are slim. With that in mind, roll on February 2019.</p>
