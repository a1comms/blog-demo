<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Facebook&rsquo;s hitting the headlines again over privacy.</span></p>
<p>The world of social media is a mysterious place. Facebook has become such an integral part of our social lives that few of us can imagine a world without it. But what&rsquo;s the cost of using this platform day-in, day-out?</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been lots of theories relating to how Facebook uses our data. Most seem either harmless or wildly outlandish and unbelievable, but recently, there was one which was neither of these things. Just last week, in fact, worrying news surfaced of the network accessing our personal data without permission.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17032" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OKA9QCbL0e46NaSt--ybgyaW-3Jh9auDHhbawkv2nq7e9hI---RufEWQ5jt9dejytr3Q78x__df_y-GboDRnmoY3JA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>It's an 'Opt in' Feature!</h2>
<p>In a theoretical article, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica</a> suggested that the network could be harvesting phone call and SMS data through Android apps. The idea is that two apps &ndash; Messenger and Facebook Lite &ndash; may be accessing users&rsquo; call lists and text messages without asking them first. Of course, the powers at Facebook were extremely quick to deny this in the form of a public blog post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people&rsquo;s call and SMS (text) history without their permission,&rdquo; says the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/fact-check-your-call-and-sms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> by the social network. &ldquo;This is not the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17026" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LxTYOHz89flezm6tJDJKI7IlVxYJZaST9OxBZvbZq9y7iGb4AyaLe1X1C3OyoIUQSbxzcQX3Rc1uM63Xp_rmEgkj1w=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Despite the social media group denying accessing this data without permission, they explained that text and call logging does exist. Apparently, it&rsquo;s an &lsquo;opt in&rsquo; feature for Android users &ndash; and has been since 2015. So, have you opted in? Well, maybe.</p>
<p>According to the post, when you first set up the Facebook Lite or Messenger app, you&rsquo;ll have been given the option to continuously upload your contacts and call and text history. If you decided to opt in and use this feature, the app will have been keeping a log of your phone activity. Oh, and you can download this log whenever you want using the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467?helpref=page_content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Your Information</a> tool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook,&rdquo; the post explains. &ldquo;People have to expressly agree to use this feature.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>How do you turn the logging feature off?</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Facebook logging your calls and texts and an Android user, here&rsquo;s where to go if you can&rsquo;t <em>quite </em>remember whether you opted in when you first set up your Messenger or Facebook Lite apps. The good news is you can turn this feature off whenever you please and doing so couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Phew.</p>
<p>If you have the Messenger app on your Android device, just head to Home, tap your Profile Picture, got to People, and then click Synced Contacts. You can then choose whether to sync your contacts or not by turning the setting off. Easy.</p>
<p>Should you be using the Facebook Lite app, things are a little different, but no less simple. Tap the Menu button, go to App Settings, and then find Continuous Contacts Upload to turn the setting off. When you&rsquo;ve done so, the app will stop logging the information.</p>
