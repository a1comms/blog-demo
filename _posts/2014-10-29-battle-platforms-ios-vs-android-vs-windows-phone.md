<h2>iOS vs Android vs Windows Phone</h2>
<p><span class="postStandFirst">With so many smartphones out there, and so many operating platforms available, how do you choose which one is right for you? We put iOS, Android and Windows Phone to the test to help you make the right choice.</span></p>
<h2>iOS</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5785" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/apple-catch-up.jpg" alt="apple catch up" width="342" height="400" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often said that if you want to give a smartphone to someone who&rsquo;s never used a smartphone before, you give them an iPhone. That&rsquo;s not just an empty saying, either; if there&rsquo;s one thing that iOS (the platform powering the iPhone) really excels at, it&rsquo;s in offering a completely intuitive interface that&rsquo;s an absolute doddle to pick up and learn, even for people who have never used a touchscreen smartphone before!</p>
<p>Of course, it also offers a ton of useful features, from the now-famous Siri to the App Store, and the fact that all of these features are so unbelievably easy to use is a testament to the skill of Apple&rsquo;s engineers.</p>

<p>People who want their smartphone to be dead easy to pick up and learn, while still offering bags of power.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/Android-Army-e1370457699589.jpg" alt="Android" width="642" height="361" /></p>
<p>Millions of people all round the world use Android; it is, in fact, the world&rsquo;s most popular smartphone platform, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. For starters, the whole Android experience has been improved (thanks to the oddly-named &ldquo;Project Butter&rdquo;), so everything is sleek and gorgeous. You get access to a ton of extra features like Google Now, Hangouts, Gmail, and Youtube, as a core part of the operating system.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about the Android experience, though, is how deeply customisable it is. From simple things like changing the wallpaper or the widgets on your homescreen, up to the more complex things like downloading a whole new interface from Google Play, Android lets you make your phone truly your own!</p>
<p><strong>Perfect for...</strong></p>
<p>People who want a powerful smartphone that&rsquo;s <i>totally</i> customisable, and who don&rsquo;t mind the slightly steeper learning curve.</p>
<h2>Windows Phone</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5639" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/windows-phone-8d-1024x546.png" alt="iOS vs Android vs Windows Phone" width="768" height="409" /></p>
<p>While Android and iOS are the &ldquo;Big Two&rdquo; in the world of smartphone platforms, Windows Phone is rapidly making a name for itself as the hot new kid on the block, who has come in and is <i>seriously</i> starting to shake up the market.</p>
<p>Windows Phone takes some of the customisability of Android (as seen with the Live Tile interface), combines it with the gentler learning curve of iOS, and wraps both up in an <i>incredibly</i> slick and responsive operating system. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, it also comes with access to Xbox Live, to give your mobile gaming an extra dimension of awesome.</p>
<p><b>Perfect for...</b></p>
<p>People who want a sleek smartphone experience that&rsquo;s both customisable <i>and</i> easy to learn, and which will sync up perfectly with their home PC.</p>
