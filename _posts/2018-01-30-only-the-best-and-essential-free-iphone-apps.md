<p>Ready to update your iPhone and nab yourself a whole load of free apps? Well, of course you are. If you don&rsquo;t know where to start, you just so happen to have come to the right place.</p>
<p>From TED to Timehop, and lots in between, we take a look at some of the top and most essential iOS apps that everyone needs to download.</p>
<h2>1) Periscope</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GGXmWYv6PU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Fancy tuning into a load of people from around the world as they live stream everything and anything?</p>
<p>Periscope allows you to do just that. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the free iOS app, you can search through the channels and find people who are in the midst of a stream.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you happen to be in different time zones, there&rsquo;s also the &lsquo;save&rsquo; function which means that you can go back and watch videos that were recently recorded. This essential iPhone app is seriously easy to use and you only need a Twitter account to sign in.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/periscope-live-video-streaming-around-the-world/id972909677?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>2) WhatsApp</h2>

<p>There are plenty of messaging apps out there so why should you choose WhatsApp? Well, this free iPhone app lets you talk to just about anyone (so long as they have a smartphone and the app).</p>
<p>Rather than using up your text message allowance, the app connects to the internet so that you can send photos, videos, and even voice messages for the grand old sum of nothing.</p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s super simple to set up a group chat for messaging a whole bunch of people at once.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>3) Groupon</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GM1QDBvzm1Y" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re heading out for a nice, romantic meal or planning a skydiving experience, Groupon is the first place you need to check.</p>
<p>The site has hundreds of deals for people all around the country. Luckily, there's a free iOS app for the site which you should probably hurry up and download right away. You'll need to sign up with an email address and choose your location; Groupon covers most major cities in the UK, and so you should have no issue finding deals near you. You can then start browsing the wide range of experiences, meals, and goods at your leisure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to pinch some pennies here and there, using a discount app like this one is a fabulous place to start.</p>

<h2>4) Pocket</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here, we&rsquo;re all busy people. We don&rsquo;t have hours and hours to spend sitting and staring at our phones each day. If only that were the case, right? Instead, we are constantly on the go.</p>
<p>When you happen to spy an interesting article on your phone, you might not always have the time to sit and read it then and there. With Pocket, the free iOS app, that&rsquo;s not a problem anymore. All you need to do is click a button and save the article in your virtual &lsquo;pocket&rsquo; for later. When you have a chance to relax and read a little, you can open it back up and give it the full attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Enjoying all the articles, blogs, and information of the internet has never been so straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-and-videos-to-view-later/id309601447?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pocket</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>5) Duolingo</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OebgtUjLg4?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Planning a summer holiday this year? Well, why not sharpen up your language skills before you head off?</p>
<p>The good people of Seville will love it when you whip out your Spanish and the people of Berlin will say &lsquo;danke&rsquo; when you throw in a few words here and there.</p>
<p>If you want to get to grips with a new language, there is a strikingly easy way to do so. Duolingo is an essential iPhone app that everyone should download. Once you have it, you just need to select the language you want to learn and get started. There are games, quizzes, and flashcards to help you along the way. You&rsquo;ll be speaking like a local in no time at all.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french-and-more/id570060128?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Duolingo</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>6) Quartz<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13437" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-kQNOwfFYSKj5DaFc0xwXDbHO3oV62jb5JY_wqs6V5FB8HQQ5T2Ag6TT92teZoGf9Eu9RPOvuyOhYlGSK1GL1XR0g=s0" alt="" /></h2>
<p>Are you done reading through endless text to just get the latest headlines? Well, then Quartz may just be the best iOS app for you.</p>
<p>Every day, it'll give you the latest news in message form (within the app!). If you&rsquo;d like to know more about a particular story, you can just interact with the messages and ask for any information that you may need.</p>
<p>To make things a little interesting, the app includes GIFs, photos, and even charts to help you grasp the news in a fun, engaging way. Plus, once there are no more stories to discover, it'll give you a fun quiz or the like to keep you entertained.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><strong>Quartz</strong><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>7) Prisma</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13438" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VqArfGHu6sFXZACyfON9C9zL2lu176ElTOPN1DBF-3eRk8TQZK0kJWgvN_zKvzyNnX33ZkTp5GJCVnaPGsbwxNs=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Make your selfies look like real pieces of art with the editing app Prisma.</p>
<p>For a long time, this has been touted as one of the best iOS apps for creating truly original pictures. And, frankly, there&rsquo;s good reason for that. While there is just no end to the apps out there that will help you edit your snaps, this one is a tad different. For one thing, the so-called &lsquo;modern art filters&rsquo; mean that you can transform your ordinary picture into the style of a famous painting. In mere seconds, that means that your image will go from &lsquo;meh&rsquo; to &lsquo;wow&rsquo;. Oh, and in case you&rsquo;re wondering, it&rsquo;s totally free to use.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prisma-free-photo-editor-art-filters-pic-effects/id1122649984?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prisma</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>8) Spotify</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13439" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xJAudKpEsd5LDjwRcpXeEc-8IdFbCqeU6KnHJRhyhyc2C85XtEBNxfeKjnrtgcOQR4CjV8P2AQl2Ir3aDAs_FGlVJA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Long gone are the days when we used to buy CDs or cheekily download songs from the net (Oh, Limewire, how we miss you!). Nowadays, we have all the music we could possibly want at the click of a button on our phones.</p>
<p>The free iOS Spotify app is simple to use and gives you access to thousands of tracks in mere seconds. If you don&rsquo;t want to pay a subscription, you will have to deal with adverts at regular intervals. However, the &lsquo;Premium&rsquo; version of the app allows you to listen to &lsquo;advert-free&rsquo; music whenever you so feel. What&rsquo;s more, you can download as many songs to the app as you like, which means that you can listen to them even when you&rsquo;ve got no signal or WiFi.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Spotify</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>9) Strava</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ME_0Ic1sheA" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Dubbed the &lsquo;Social Network for Athletes&rsquo;, Strava is one of the most essential iPhone apps for anyone who is partial to a bit of activity now and then.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re heading for a run, bike ride, or just a brisk walk, this free app&nbsp;can track your movements and even map them out for you. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded and signed up to Strava, you can start setting new exercise goals for yourself, monitoring your progress, and sharing it with the world.</p>
<p>The app helps you analyse how you&rsquo;re performing and gives you tips on how you can improve. What&rsquo;s more, if you get the desktop version of Strava, you can look even deeper into your daily activity.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/strava-running-and-cycling-gps/id426826309?mt=8"><strong>Strava</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>10) Uber</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13442" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/62e8z69TTmIUpWvnvOFszqiCrcR2aaoKyYwx5afSAxNGMvl4Ss7zuVL66g_mxuc31o4EzYYsb7kMWH6yGzIh-vQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Frankly, if you don&rsquo;t have the Uber app right now, you&rsquo;re missing out. This is one of the best iOS apps of our time for one crucial reason: it&rsquo;s changed the way we travel forever.</p>
<p>Getting a cab used to be a thing of luxury. You&rsquo;d only do it when you really needed to or when you were in a major rush. Uber has changed all of that, though. These days, ordering a car to come pick you up is as easy as pie. When you&rsquo;ve signed up to the service, you can click a button and ask to get a taxi (well, an Uber!) as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Since the free iOS app launched, Uber&nbsp;really has come a long way. This was originally developed as a car-sharing service, but it&rsquo;s morphed into something quite spectacular and essential to modern life. From UberPool, which allows you to split the cost of your cab with strangers, to Uber Exec, which gives you a snazzy &lsquo;business class&rsquo; car, there&rsquo;s lots&nbsp;to love here.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/uber/id368677368?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Uber</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re exploring a new city or just trying to navigate your own, Citymapper is the perfect companion. Forget having to stare at bus timetables or maps to find your way around; there&rsquo;s a much simpler way to do things.</p>
<p>The free iOS app is dubbed one of the best travel apps ever, and for great reason. Simply choose your city, type in where you are and where you want to get to, and the app will do all the hard work for you. In mere seconds, it maps out your route using public transport. It even gives you to-the-minute travel information, such as live times and how long your journey will take. Genius.</p>

<p>With the now-famous tagline 'ideas worth spreading', TED is one of the most essential free iOS apps in the store. Why? Well in short: punchy videos.</p>
<p>You can gain a basic knowledge of a whole load of different subjects from design to entrepreneurship. Online TED talks are 100% free to watch, unlike the rather costly conferences.</p>
<p>Once you download the app, you can start creating playlists that are specific to your interests and your lust for learning. You will also get regular suggested videos, which are based on talks that you&rsquo;ve watched before. A world of knowledge in your pocket? Um, yes please.</p>

<p>Staying fit can often be an uphill struggle. Quite literally.</p>
<p>Sure, one of the main things that holds people back when it comes to exercise is a sheer lack of motivation. Comfortably striking a balance between social and personal app, we have the nifty little Runkeeper app.</p>
<p>This essential iOS app allows you to track and monitor your runs and workouts in real-time, and is one of the best iPhone apps for keeping fit. What&rsquo;s more, you can set yourself goals and activities, which will mean that you&rsquo;re more likely to achieve results in your personal fitness regime.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the social aspect of the app comes into play; you can publish your goals <em>and </em>your results in the community. That means that your friends and family who use the free app can also see your progress.</p>

<p>While there are a whole load of news and magazine apps out there, Flipboard is totally different.

<p>Frowned upon by many, the modern-day ritual of taking a quick snap of our food before we eat it isn&rsquo;t going anywhere fast. You only have to glance at Instagram to know that this is a trend that will likely outlive them all.

<p>Most of us already know that AirBnb is one of the quickest (and often cheapest) ways in which to find a place to stay. Once you&rsquo;ve signed up for an account, which you can do via Facebook, you&rsquo;re free to start searching for some of the best places to stay around the globe. From beach houses to inner city apartment, there&rsquo;s something to suit almost any style of holiday.</p>
<p>The free iOS version of the app allows you to seamlessly search for places in specific areas, such as London, Birmingham and Newcastle. All you have to do is pick a place, add some handy filters and start looking.</p>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, AirBnb now has so-called &lsquo;Experiences&rsquo; which you can also book via the app on your iPhone. For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re planning a quick trip to Tokyo, you can book yourself onto a two-hour ramen and gyoza making workshop. Right now, this part of the app is quite limited, but it&rsquo;s sure to expand as more experiences are added.</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, this app links to your Gmail account, which means that you can automatically chat with all your email contacts.

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but before I go to any restaurant, hotel, or bar, I do the very same thing each time. I check TripAdvisor. After all, the very last thing I want to do is waste my hard-earned pennies on services that just aren&rsquo;t worth it. While most people are in the same habit as me, few realise that TripAdvisor has a free iOS app, which you should download right now.</p>
<p>Looking up the rating of a certain place has never been easier. Just tap the app, type in the name of the place, and it will use your current location to help find it. What&rsquo;s more, you can also add your own reviews when and where you want. The app will send you a push notification when you&rsquo;ve visited a certain place and ask you to review it! Easy peasy!</p>

<p>For a long time, there was no such thing as an official Reddit app. Users were forced to use third-party options, such as the Alien Blue Reddit app, to read up on their favourite threads.

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to save yourself some time when it comes to using your iPhone, you may just have found it. Workflow is a personal automation tool, which basically means that it allows you to create shortcuts for certain activities. For instance, you can use it to add a home button that calls a certain contact or tweet the last song you listened to.

<p>Need to upgrade your social life? Meetup is a social app that helps you to meet new people, join new groups, and find out about events no matter where you are in the world. It&rsquo;s that simple. Log in, make a profile, and start joining various groups on it. From digital nomads and creative writers, to drinking groups and speed mating (as in making friends, not rushed intercourse), there&rsquo;s something for everyone out there. Ideal if you&rsquo;re moving to a new city.</p>

<p>Whether you have a Kindle or not, it&rsquo;s still worth getting the app for it. If you have one, you&rsquo;ll find that it syncs with your existing ebook library and even remembers how far you were in each book. If, on the other hand, you don&rsquo;t happen to have an actual Kindle, you can use your Amazon account to download books to your phone in seconds. That means that the next time you&rsquo;re standing at the bus stop, you&rsquo;ll have something to read!</p>
