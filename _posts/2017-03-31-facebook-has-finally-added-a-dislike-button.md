<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">And we totally <em>like</em> it!</span></p>
<p>Since the dawn of Facebook civilisation, users have been asking for just one simple thing: a &lsquo;dislike&rsquo; button. Well, we&rsquo;re now <em>finally </em>getting one&hellip; sort of. While you won&rsquo;t be able to dislike public statuses just yet, however annoying they are, you <em>will</em> be able to officially dislike any inbox messages. Find out how to do it below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13647" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8cT7-rQLjimWHeFM0wokX4XlDFB0zgfeDFcwiaKWhx5AYLKrX69U6iPt99fbWB34b_jIkHXI2-cgT8yaQXvPfLM=s0" width="600" height="302" /></p>
<p>This latest update is all part of the Facebook Messenger Reactions and Mentions features, which were recently released. The idea is that you can react to messages that people send you in the app simply by clicking on them. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Facebook Messenger Reactions</h2>
<p>Occasionally, when someone sends you a message on Facebook, you struggle for words to describe exactly how you&rsquo;re feeling. That&rsquo;s where reactions come into play. For example, if someone sends you a message about, oh I don&rsquo;t know, bailing on plans you&rsquo;ve had for months, you can hit that message to give it a huge thumbs-down, i.e. dislike it. It lets them know just how disappointed you <em>really</em> are with their flaky nonsense.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not all about sheer negativity. You can react to messages in a whole wealth of ways. Aside from the &lsquo;dislike&rsquo; button, there&rsquo;s also a &lsquo;wow&rsquo;, &lsquo;love&rsquo;, &lsquo;sad&rsquo;, &lsquo;angry&rsquo;, and &lsquo;happy&rsquo; button. All you need to do is tap and hold the message in question until a pop-up bar with all the reactions appears. Then, choose the reaction that best describes the way you feel, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>When your friend opens the chat again, the first thing they&rsquo;ll see is your reaction, popping&nbsp;up on the screen. (Psst&hellip; If you don&rsquo;t like having these reactions pop up, you can turn them off in the settings at any time!).</p>

<p><a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/03/introducing-message-reactions-and-mentions-for-messenger/" target="_blank">Facebook&rsquo;s Newsroom explains</a>, &ldquo;Message Reactions are the ability to react to an individual message with a specific emotion, quickly showing acknowledgement or expressing how you feel in a lightweight way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, if someone messages a photo of their cute pet, you could respond with the love reaction. Or, if someone is trying to coordinate dinner plans, you could easily respond with a yes or no reaction to indicate your preferences.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Facebook Messenger Mentions</h2>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, Facebook has also launched a Mentions feature in the Messenger app. This will obviously work best for group chats or even the Facebook Workplace Chat app. When you&rsquo;re having a massive conversation, some people tend to tune out (or even put the chat on &lsquo;silent&rsquo; mode).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13652" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KB7RTp8wpjd-7piRpOnK1oqmjWYi6W9mtzDlX6Hdypgas6WiD38RPWTd31C00fmn-UIOMuv9nN2U_Zx875mswYo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Mentioning them in the conversation means that they&rsquo;ll be notified about a specific message. Just type &lsquo;@&rsquo; and then the person&rsquo;s name. Of course, you can <em>only </em>mention people that are already in the group chat; no outsiders. Although it&rsquo;s not life-changing, this handy little feature will make the whole group chat thing a load smoother.</p>
