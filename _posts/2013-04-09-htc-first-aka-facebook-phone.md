<p><span class="postStandFirst">As well as bringing us the brand new user experience, Facebook has commissioned HTC to create a phone worthy of being dubbed the Facebook Phone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5480 aligncenter" alt="HTC First" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/htc-first-slide-01.png" width="500" height="455" /></p>
<p>The HTC First is a wonderfully crafted and well-balanced smartphone, offering excellent specs with extra Facebook flavour thrown in.</p>
<p>The smartphone sports a minimalist design and flaunts an excellent 4.3 inch super LCD display with a pixel density of 342ppi.</p>
<p>Powering the First is a 1.4GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor and 1GB of RAM, meaning the HTC First has plenty of zip and wont struggle to keep up with all your friends&rsquo; posts through Facebook.</p>
<p>The handset is running on Jelly Bean 4.1.2 but ships with a custom-loaded Facebook Home skin, and a custom-built system which brings in all the goodness of Facebook as well as apps such as Instagram.</p>
<p>There is a 5 megapixel camera, capable of recording 1080p video with 720p playback, which is great for viewing your photos and videos before sharing with friends.</p>
<p>The Facebook phone also comes complete with Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and even 4G, meaning that it will support the fastest data transmission available and allow you to keep chatting endlessly with the world!</p>
<p><strong>The HTC First is a superb handset, featuring all mod cons such as Jelly Bean, NFC and 4G, combined with a new smartphone experience through Facebook Home. Our verdict? A brilliant all-rounder that offers just enough to be that little bit different.</strong></p>
