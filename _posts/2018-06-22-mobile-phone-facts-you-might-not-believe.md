<p>How much do you know about mobile phones? If, like most of us, you&rsquo;ve grown up in the age of smartphones, you might think you&rsquo;re pretty clued up. Still, you can&rsquo;t know everything.</p>
<p>Here are 10 mobile phone facts that are too weird to believe&hellip; and yet you should!</p>
<h2>1) The first mobile phone cost about &pound;2500</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17787" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/foLKSDjvBarv1tLbQ8zGb0pP2Of1xbYkctsaRvnid8B3XT8d22m-JGotCA9bGvMXcWfZDMtQC38bwMQF8oRas9lw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you think that mobile phones are a 21st Century gadget, think again. In fact, the first mobile device was <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/388974/40-years-of-the-mobile-phone-Top-20-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold in the US</a> back in 1983. It was developed by a man named Martin Cooper (pictured above), and, unsurprisingly, this new piece of technology was anything but cheap&hellip; It cost around $4,000 (or &pound;2,500). Yikes.</p>
<h2>2) Mobile phones are dirtier than toilet handles</h2>
<p>Your smartphone goes just about everywhere with you&hellip; which means that it picks up a whole load of germs along the way. A used smartphone carries around <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1298057/Mobile-phones-18-times-bacteria-toilet-handle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 times more</a> &lsquo;potentially harmful&rsquo; types of bacteria than a toilet seat. Yuck.</p>
<h2>3) Your mobile is more powerful than a spaceship!</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power locked inside your modern-day smartphone. It&rsquo;s incredible. The average phone now has more computing power than the computers used for the Apollo 11 moon landing, according to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/diypodcast/rocket-evolution-index-diy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info from NASA</a>.</p>
<h2>4) Back in 2012, Apple sold 340,000 iPhones per day</h2>
<p>You already knew that iPhone is super popular, but did you know <em>this </em>little fact? Back in 2012, the iPhone sales were at a serious high. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-fiscal-2012-in-numbers-125m-iphones-58-31m-ipads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple sold around 340,000 smartphones</a> per day&hellip; that adds up to 125 million phones in that year.</p>
<h2>5) Scientists can charge phones using urine</h2>

<p>It might sound a little gross, but it&rsquo;s true! Scientists down in Bristol have developed a way of charging phones using urine, according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23333533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>. Researchers believe that the future of charging could involve using &lsquo;smart toilets&rsquo; to gain and store energy.</p>

<p>How often do you check your smartphone? <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2449632/How-check-phone-The-average-person-does-110-times-DAY-6-seconds-evening.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figures</a> from a screen lock app show that the average person unlocks their phone around 110 times each day. What&rsquo;s more, the &lsquo;peak&rsquo; unlocking time happens between 5pm and 8pm!</p>
<h2>7) The fear of being without your phone is real!</h2>
<p>Ever feared being phone-less or losing signal for a significant period of time? You&rsquo;re not alone. This phenomenon actually has a name &ndash; <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomofobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomofobia</a>. The term is a combination of the phrase &lsquo;no mobile phobia&rsquo; and&hellip; let&rsquo;s face it&hellip; we&rsquo;ve all been there.</p>
<h2>8) More people have mobiles than toilets globally</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17797" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/e9YX12T10sj3HkXfSQBA4agdhAWBqDggoAWD9P04vvQ7EkFngADLe2IC66KSL5F61aTgFRihN5ANLAH_0wAvKUsQ=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Mobile phones are essential&hellip; but are they more essential than, say, a toilet? There are <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/world-toilet-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more people in the world that have a mobile phone</a> than have a toilet. Let that sink in. While awesome tech is obviously important, it shouldn&rsquo;t come before world sanitation.</p>
<h2>9) Nearly half of smartphone users &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t live without&rsquo; them</h2>
<p>Could you go a day without your phone? How about a lifetime? A massive 46% of smartphone users say that they &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t live without&rsquo; the device, according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/01/6-facts-about-americans-and-their-smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research</a>. That&rsquo;s almost half of the world&rsquo;s users.</p>
<h2>10) A huge 99% of malware is targeted at Android phones</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s good news for iPhone users! If you&rsquo;re worried about malware, here&rsquo;s a fact that you need to know. A huge 99% of malware targets Android phones and device operating systems, according to details from <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Mobile_Threat_Report_Q1_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Secure</a>. Yikes.</p>
