<p><span class="postStandFirst">This year&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress saw the launch of two new smartphones which have been highly anticipated by, well, the entire world. Both Sony and Samsung brought their A-game, to produce devices that are worthy of the label &lsquo;superphone&rsquo;. But which is better?</span></p>
<p>In a grand showdown between the&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, two of the newest and most powerful smartphones in the world, which one will emerge victorious?</p>
<h2>Design and looks</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2644/12972243264_34f3053b9b_z.jpg" width="576" height="153" /></p>
<p>This category is always going to come down to personal preference, and the truth is that both phones are, without a doubt, gorgeous. However, the Sony Xperia Z2 has a marginally bigger screen, and combined with its harder-edged design ethos, we&rsquo;d have to pick it as the better-looking of these two supermodels. The purple version is also one of the most beautiful things we&rsquo;ve ever seen!</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5, meanwhile, has a slight edge in terms of usability, thanks to the dimpled back fascia,&nbsp; which makes the phone easier to keep a grip on, and the hardware buttons just below the screen, which keeps those buttons from taking up valuable space on the screen.</p>
<p>Thus, we have to call this category a draw.</p>
<h2>Internal hardware</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2166/12971828443_7237cc2f0a_z.jpg" width="568" height="296" /></strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that both phones have the same processor (a Snapdragon 801, although the Samsung&rsquo;s processor is slightly faster, at 2.5GHz), there is a major difference in the internal hardware of each phone. Specifically, the Sony Xperia Z2 has 3GB of RAM, compared to the Samsung&rsquo;s 2GB, and that&rsquo;s going to make a noticeable difference in terms of performance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a fingerprint scanner, so really, we&rsquo;re going to have to call&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;category a draw, as well.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>In terms of features, there&rsquo;s not much to separate the cameras in these two superphones (don&rsquo;t expect any extra software trickery of the kind found in the Nokia Lumia 1020), so as much as it pains us to do this, we&rsquo;re going to have to compare them on raw megapixel counts.</p>
<p>Since it has a 20.7MP camera, compared to the 16MP camera in the Samsung, the Sony Xperia Z2 wins this category!</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/12971828483_6eebf939c0_z.jpg" width="515" height="293" /></strong></p>
<p>While the Sony easily won the last category, the situation is reversed here; while both phones use Android 4.4.2 KitKat, the Samsung has a&nbsp;<em>ton</em>&nbsp;of extra features, like Smart Stay, Smart Scroll and Air Gestures (allowing you to interact with the phone without touching the screen), so it simply has to be the winner in terms of software.</p>
<h2>Resistance to the elements</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/12972354304_c258f0a7fd_z.jpg" width="599" height="356" /></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the &lsquo;hardiness&rsquo; of each phone, as both Sony and Samsung&rsquo;s flagships are now dust- and water-resistant. However, while the Samsung Galaxy S5 is better at keeping dust out, the Sony Xperia Z2 is much better at keeping water out, so unbelievably,&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;category is a draw, as well!</p>
<p><strong>The simple truth of the matter is this: it really is&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>&nbsp;to pick which of these two superphones is better. Sure, the two phones are completely different, but they&rsquo;re both astoundingly good. No matter which one you buy, you can be sure you&rsquo;re getting one of the greatest phones ever made!</strong></p>
