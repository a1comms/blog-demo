<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It seems the Apple founder predicted what would happen.</span></p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s recent mass data breach scandal has sparked a new movement.</p>
<p>Yes, the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/how-to-delete-your-facebook-account-for-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#DeleteFacebook</a> challenge is well underway after private information from around 50 million users was supposedly harvested by the Cambridge Analytica.</p>
<p>The mysterious political analytics firm may have been linked to the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory in the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
<p>Data protection has become an increasingly hot topic in recent years. In fact, just a year before his death in 2011, Apple founder Steve Jobs spoke out about the issue.</p>
<p>During the Wall Street Journal conference, All Things Digital (<em>which Mark Zuckerberg attended</em>), Jobs warned that companies should let users know &lsquo;precisely what [they&rsquo;re] going to do with their data.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silicon Valley is not monolithic. We&rsquo;ve always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley. Privacy means people know what they&rsquo;re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly,&rdquo; stated Jobs in the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you&rsquo;re going to do with their data. A lot of people in the Valley think we&rsquo;re really old-fashioned about this, and maybe we are, but we worry about stuff like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jobs was right to worry about data breaches and the effect that they could have on businesses. Last week, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s net worth dropped by a massive $5.1 billion. The company&rsquo;s stock dropped by almost 7% in a matter of mere hours.</p>

<p>Responding to this online in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a>, Zuckerberg admitted the company made mistakes and said that he will make sure a breach like this one never happens again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again,&rdquo; the CEO wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.&rdquo;</p>
