<p><span class="postStandFirst">New rumours have emerged suggesting that &lsquo;iPhone 6s&rsquo; (as well as its larger sibling, &lsquo;iPhone 6s Plus&rsquo;) could launch a month earlier than expected, and with a brand new camera on-board...</span></p>
<p>It is a simple law of nature that, just as iPhone 6 replaced iPhone 5s as Apple&rsquo;s top-end flagship, iPhone 6 will be replaced by another new offering this year. It&rsquo;s said to be called iPhone 6s, and it turns out that we might see it earlier than expected.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/iphone-6s-rumored-to-launch-as-soon-as-august-1294209" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>, who are citing a story from China&rsquo;s United Daily News, Apple may have moved the launch of iPhone 6s up from September to August.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether this will actually happen (it&rsquo;s said to be the &ldquo;result of an excessive component yield&rdquo;), but what also remains to be seen is whether Apple will have iOS 9 ready in time, if the company <em>does</em> bring the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus forward.</p>
<p>Whether the launch date moves or not, though, one thing that we&rsquo;re definitely expecting to see is a bigger camera; rumours have consistently pointed towards the resolution of the camera in iPhone 6s being bumped up from 8MP to 12MP.</p>
<p>There may be a catch, however, as the same rumours are also stating that each individual pixel would be smaller, and if <em>that</em> is true, it would suggest that the low-light performance of iPhone 6s will be trumped by its predecessor.</p>
<p>Of course, there is one other important thing which many have said to take into account: the probability of Apple releasing an iPhone that&rsquo;s inferior to its predecessor is <em>basically</em> zero.</p>
<p><strong>All of this is, of course, rumour. We&rsquo;ll have more on this story as it develops, so stay tuned! </strong></p>
