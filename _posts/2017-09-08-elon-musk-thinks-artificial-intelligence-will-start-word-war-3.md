<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">&ldquo;Come with me if you want to live!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>If someone asked you who (or what) was going to cause the third World War, you&rsquo;d likely have a few guesses up your sleeve. Frankly, there are no prizes for the answer at the top of everybody&rsquo;s list right now&hellip; But what if we&rsquo;re <em>all</em> wrong?</p>
<p>According to Elon Musk, we just might be. The world-famous CEO tweeted his thoughts on the matter, and it seems that he has his own ideas about how things may go down. There are just two words you need to know here: artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes, Musk says that "competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3&rdquo;. Um, okay. Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t just leave it there. Instead, he went into detail on Twitter letting everyone out there know just how dark his vision of the future really is. Brace yourself&hellip; This is quite a read.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904638455761612800">September 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>So, how does Musk think that this will all play out. Well, frankly, like the plot of everyone&rsquo;s favourite sci-fi movie, by the sound of it. In his next tweet, he went on to explain that it wouldn&rsquo;t be country leaders controlling the AI either, but the AI itself that initiates things. Yikes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904639405440323585">September 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Needless to say, some people were sceptical about this futuristic drama. One Twitter user, Andrew Kemendo, pointed out that governments don&rsquo;t tend to be quick at creating innovative new technology. Luckily, Musk had an answer for that one too&hellip;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904656511334354948">September 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Pfft&hellip; So while we were all here worrying our heads about North Korea&rsquo;s next move, we should really have been keeping our eyes peeled for the real-life Terminator. What&rsquo;s more, Musk had a thing or two to say about the former threat.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904640183932301312">September 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Well, at least there&rsquo;s some good news, right? Musk doesn&rsquo;t seem to think that North Korea will actually do <em>anything</em>. Phew. That&rsquo;s a relief. He even went on to say that the country should be &lsquo;low on our list of concerns&rsquo;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904641970349285376">September 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time that Musk has spoken out about the possible threat of AI technology. In fact, last month, he joined other experts in asking the UN to ban killer robots. So, you can add them to the list of things that stop you sleeping at night now.</p>
