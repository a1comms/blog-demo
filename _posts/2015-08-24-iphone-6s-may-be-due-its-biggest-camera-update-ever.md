<p><span class="postStandFirst">An anonymous source, who claims to be working on iPhone 6S, has come forward to reveal that it&rsquo;ll boast the biggest camera update for years.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re drawing ever closer to the launch of the next Apple iPhone, the oft-rumoured iPhone 6s (or iPhone 7). As we get closer and closer to the hour, more rumours seem to be bubbling to the surface.</p>
<p>The latest, according to TechRadar, claims that iPhone 6s will offer users a significantly more advanced camera, outperforming every predecessor by some margin.</p>
<p>Specifically, the new rumour is asserting that the 8-megapixel iSight camera is set for a bump up to 12-megapixels.</p>
<p>This will still sit below rival devices, like Samsung Galaxy S6, but as we know a quality camera isn&rsquo;t solely reliant on its number of megapixels&hellip;</p>
<p>Because, the truly exciting news is the rumoured upgrade to a two-lens system, which could allow iPhone 6s to capture DSLR quality images to rival even the professionals.</p>
<p>Naturally, for now, we can only take this speculation in the usual quantities of salt. Though with the launch alleged to be just over a couple of weeks away now, we don&rsquo;t have long to wait.</p>
<p><strong>Could iPhone 6s end up taking the crown as the best camera phone on the market? We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on it to find out, so watch this space for more news!</strong></p>
