<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span class="postStandFirst">The Duo Camera on the HTC One M8 is known throughout the world as the camera that can change focus on a photo after it&rsquo;s been taken. We take a look at how the Duo Camera works, at how it pulls off its big party trick, and at whether it does actually involve time travel (spoiler: it doesn&rsquo;t).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4672" alt="HTC One Review" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/07/HTC-One-Review-1024x520.jpg" width="672" height="341" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of phones arrive on shelves in 2014, and each one of them brings with it a selection of awesome features (e.g. water-resistance in the Sony Xperia Z2, a Quad-HD screen in the LG G3, and so on), but one feature arguably stands out as being the coolest.</p>
<p>That feature is the Duo Camera in the HTC One M8, a feature that many have summed up as &ldquo;<i>the camera that lets you change a photo&rsquo;s focus after it&rsquo;s been taken</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That sentence, without any extra explanation, is going to catch a lot of people&rsquo;s attention, and let&rsquo;s be honest, it <i>should</i>, since it makes the HTC One M8&rsquo;s Duo Camera feel like it&rsquo;s powered by some kind of quantum time-travelling temporal-lens-moving technology. It&rsquo;s not powered by that, of course (more&rsquo;s the pity), but it turns out that the way it does work is actually intriguing in its own right.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4300" alt="14305507606_6109af1e03" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14305507606_6109af1e03.jpg" width="500" height="300" /></p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the question we&rsquo;ll be answering today. The HTC One M8&rsquo;s Duo Camera: how does it work?</p>
<p>There are actually two elements to the Duo Camera (that should be obvious from the name), that we need to look at. The first is the main image sensor, the actual &ldquo;camera&rdquo; part of the Duo Camera. It&rsquo;s the same UltraPixel sensor found in the original HTC One, which comes in at 4MP, and while that is a lower megapixel count than other phones, the sensor itself (and thus each pixel on it) is <i>physically</i> larger. What we&rsquo;ve got here, then, is a 4MP sensor that captures roughly as much light as a 12MP sensor, leading to vastly improved low-light performance, and less graininess in the photos you take.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s one part of the Duo Camera equation. The other part is the second sensor that gives the camera its name. Rather than grabbing a second image, what sensor actually is, in fact, is a <i>depth </i>sensor, and when you take a photo, it captures 3D depth information about the scene in front of it. Thus, each photo taken comes with its own <i>depth map</i>, noting how far away each element in the photo is.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5227" alt="Duo Camera" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/09/imgres.jpg" width="203" height="248" /></p>
<p>Once your photo has a depth map, it&rsquo;s then a tiny little jump to the phone knowing which objects are in the foreground, and which are in the background, and that is where the &ldquo;<i>change a photo&rsquo;s focus after it&rsquo;s been taken</i>&rdquo; party trick comes into play. You see, it&rsquo;s not actually changing the focus of the base photo; instead, the Duo Camera can selectively add a lens blur effect to either foreground or background objects, a trick known as 'bokeh'.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re not limited to just adding selective lens blur effects to a photo; you can also add other effects, with one of the coolest ones (for people of a certain age bracket, anyway) being a &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; effect that <i>really</i> looks like that one music video by <i>A-Ha</i>...</p>
<p><strong>And so, using a combination of depth-sensing hardware and clever software features, the end result is camera that seems to defy the laws of physics. It&rsquo;s not <i>quite</i> quantum time-travelling temporal-lens-moving technology, but since that tech doesn&rsquo;t actually <i>exist</i>, the Duo Camera is the closest we&rsquo;re going to get to actual time travel!</strong></p>
