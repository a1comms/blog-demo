<p><span class="postStandFirst">The official Scrabble book has added lotsa dench new words to its now totally ridic lexicon, just for lolz of course.</span></p>
<p>I shizzle you not, 6,500 new words have been officially introduced into the Scrabble wordlist, to accommodate the growing catalogue of slang and colloquialisms used predominantly by the millennial generation.</p>
<p>Technology has evidently played its part in the Scrabble revision, as reflected by such words as <em>FaceTime</em> (a video call between two <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a> devices), <em>hashtag</em> (a label used on social media to identify a specific word or topic), sexting (sending sexually explicit images via a mobile phone), <em>tweep</em> (one who uses Twitter) and <em>emoji</em> (a digital icon used to express an idea or emotion).</p>
<p>Though social media slang and text-talk appear to have contributed most.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cakehole (one&rsquo;s mouth)</li>
<li>Obvs (obviously&hellip; obviously)</li>
<li>Ridic (ridiculous)</li>
<li>Dench (of the highest quality or degree)</li>
<li>Newb (short for newbie, one who is an inexperienced newcomer to an activity)</li>
<li>Bezzy (denoting a person&rsquo;s best friend)</li>
<li>Lolz (fun, laughter or general tomfoolery)</li>
<li>Shizzle (used as a euphemism for &lsquo;sh*t&rsquo;, or a replacement for &lsquo;sure&rsquo;)</li>
<li>Tuneage (music)</li>
<li>Thankx (thanks)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other words draw heavily from society trends, whether they&rsquo;re here to stay or not, such as <em>twerk</em> (a sexually provocative dance, involving gyrating hip movements in a squatting stance), <em>vape</em> (inhale and exhale vapour produced by an electronic cigarette) and <em>onesie</em> (a casual, loose-fitting garment that extends over the torso and legs).</p>
<p>Helen Newstead, head of language content at Collins Language, said: "Dictionaries have always included formal and informal English, but it used to be hard to find printed evidence of the use of slang words.</p>
<p><strong>"Now people use slang in social media posts, tweets, blogs, comments, text messages - you name it - so there's a host of evidence for informal varieties of English that simply didn't exist before."</strong></p>
