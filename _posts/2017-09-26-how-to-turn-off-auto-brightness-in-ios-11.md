<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apple has hidden the auto-brightness feature. But we found it.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already updated your iPhone to <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-ios-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS 11</a>, you&rsquo;ll have noticed the new updates and design changes. Yes, there are a load of fun new features that the latest iPhone software brings with it, like a slicker control panel, a more complete lock screen and cool messaging perks.</p>
<p>You might not be happy with all the new features, though&hellip;</p>
<p>One update that could be a little disconcerting is the auto-brightness feature, and how it&rsquo;s suddenly both auto-enabled and seemingly impossible to turn off.</p>

<p>What auto-brightness on iOS 11 does is sense how bright your environment is (i.e. whether you&rsquo;re in broad daylight or a pitch-black room) and adjusts your iPhone&rsquo;s screen brightness accordingly. You don&rsquo;t have to fiddle with it when moving from room to room, or as the light fades on an evening trek.</p>
<p>While this is no doubt a useful, intuitive, little feature, it could prove a tad pesky at times. For example, the brightness may be too much for comfort. Or, inversely, far too dim to see properly. Plus, having your iPhone choose the brightness could use more battery (unless you turn it off and keep your screen at a consistently bright level).</p>

<p>On iOS 10, switching auto-brightness off was a piece of cake. All you had to do was head to Settings > Display > Auto-Brightness. It&rsquo;s not so simple on iOS 11, because Apple has hidden the control switch in a less intuitive place.</p>
<p><strong>Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Auto-Brightness </strong></p>

<p>Once you have done all of the above, it&rsquo;s merely a case of toggling the auto-brightness feature off once and for all. Of course, you can turn auto-brightness back on whenever you may need by following the same steps and toggling the feature on. Ah, total control&hellip; it really is a wonderful thing.</p>
