<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Shut up and take my money.</span></p>
<p>Have you ever looked thoughtfully at your iPhone, while it's sat there in the palm of your hand, and wondered, "This would be, like, a thousand times cooler suspended on my wall. And much bigger too, say, the size of a full-length mirror."</p>
<p>No? Me neither. But then again, we're not the visionaries. This guy is.</p>
<p>Meet dymekraf, a YouTuber and absolute tech genius with a "little mirror project" he wanted to share with the world. Through some means of coding black magic, he created a full mirror based on iOS 10, Apple's iPhone platform. In short, this is a giant iPhone in mirror form. Blown away, yet?</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGbfaadASVk" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Complete with the date, the weather, and a whole host of apps, this guy managed to turn his standard bedroom mirror into something much more spectacular!</p>
<p>The Apple Miirror, or iMirror, works in the same way as the touchscreen on your iPhone. It has apps such as Facebook Messenger, Uber, and YouTube loaded onto it, all of which you can use simply by tapping the mirror. In his video, dymekraf shows off all the things you can do with this mirror tablet, from messaging your pals to listening to music.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that this would be a complete energy guzzler. You'd be wrong. The Apple Mirror isn&rsquo;t just hanging on the wall draining electricity. After 45 seconds of inactivity, Apple Mirror falls asleep, giving the appearance of an ordinary, unassuming mirror.</p>
<p>You can imagine the complete terror a guest in your house might experience, when giving themselves a once over in the mirror, and a FaceTime call suddenly comes in.</p>

<p>So, where, when, and how can you get your hands on one of these things? Well, you can&rsquo;t. Sadly, Apple Mirror is a personal project that has gone viral through sheer sublimity.</p>
<p>To clarify, dymekraf said, "I admire Apple&rsquo;s vision and approach to creating revolutionary products. My only goal for this project was to create something useful that I could see myself using."</p>
<p>You probably won't see this iMirror on the market anytime soon, unless, of course, Apple decides that the time is right for iOS-integrated home appliances.</p>
