<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><b></b><span class="postStandFirst">In terms of market share, Android is the most successful smartphone platform in the entire world, and now, we know just how successful it is. Yes, thanks to a fantastic software platform and a range of utterly amazing phones to run it (such as the LG G3), Android has crossed one of the big milestones, and reached one billion active users!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342" alt="Android-Army-e1370457699589" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/Android-Army-e1370457699589.jpg" width="642" height="361" /></p>
<p>Android is, by a considerable margin, the most popular smartphone operating system in the world, and the vast majority of smartphones out there are, in fact, <i>Android phones</i>. Shockingly, even with this incredible dominance, the platform is <i>still</i> growing.</p>
<p>According to ZDNet, Google&rsquo;s smartphone platform now has <i>1 billion </i>active users!</p>
<p>The news came during Google&rsquo;s I/O conference (during which they also unveiled the newest version of the platform, Android L), although it has to be said that once one gets over the shock of seeing such a big number, it&rsquo;s not actually that big a surprise. Android had 900 million active users throughout 2013 (as opposed to 400 million during 2012), so it was inevitable they would break the billion-user mark some time this year.</p>
<p>While this huge user base can be partly explained by the sheer brilliance of Android, it also has a lot to do with the range of Android <i>hardware</i> on offer. The platform powers such headline-grabbing superphones as the mighty LG G3 (with the sharpest mobile screen ever) and the HTC One M8 (with that unique and mind-blowing camera), but it&rsquo;s also the platform that brought us mid-range beauties like the Moto G, as well as a whole range of <i>really</i> nice tablets.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s not just the smartphone world where Android dominates; the platform also now controls 62% of the <i>tablet</i> market.</p>
<p>Essentially, the story of Android is one of really big numbers, with a billion active users, who send 20 billion texts and 93 million selfies <i>per day</i>.</p>
<p><strong>So congratulations, Google, on your first billion Android users, although at the rate you&rsquo;re going, it quite possibly won&rsquo;t be long until you reach your <i>second</i> billion!</strong></p>
