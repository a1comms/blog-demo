<h3>Sorry, Windows! You&rsquo;ve been knocked from the top spot</h3>
<p>While there are many operating systems out there, there&rsquo;s just no denying that some are better, quicker, and easier to use than others. If you had to guess what the most popular OS was, what would you say? While Windows has been declining in popularity of late, most of us would still guess that it&rsquo;s still at the top of the charts. Well, guess again!</p>
<h3>And, the winner is&hellip;</h3>
<p>According to a research from web analytics company, StatCounter, the most used OS right now is actually&hellip; *drum roll*... Android. The stats, which were released just a couple of weeks ago, Android is used by a whopping 37.93% of devices right now, whereas Windows is used by a close 37.91% of devices.</p>
<p>The gap between the two prevailing OS programs may seem rather minimal (just 0.02%) but this is a dramatic change in recent years. Just five years ago, in 2012, Windows were dominating the OS charts with a massive 82% of devices using it. To see the system fall so heavily over such a short period says a whole load about how we use modern-day tech.</p>
<p>Still, it seems that the good people at Windows aren&rsquo;t phased. "We are pleased that there are more than 400 million monthly active devices running Windows 10, and most importantly, that Windows 10 has the highest levels of product satisfaction over any previous version of Windows,&rdquo; a Microsoft representative recently told CNET.</p>
<h3>What do these stats mean?</h3>
<p>So, what is the reason for this drastic change? Well, the most obvious conclusion that you can draw is that people are now using their smartphones <i>way </i>more than computers of laptops. Of course, Android is a mobile OS, and so these stats show a flip in the gadgets that people use on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>In fact, the StatCounter CEO, Aodhan Cullen, agreed that the reason for this change in the stats was obvious. It seems that smartphones are more popular than ever these days. However, put simply, laptops and the like are not.</p>
<p>With the way that technology is developing and changing right now, it will be interesting to see how these numbers change in the next decade or even the next year. It could be that soon enough there will be a new system in town. Who knows? Watch this space!</p>
