<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Decisions, decisions&hellip;</span></p>
<p>This week was a <em>huge </em>one for Samsung fans. The brand released five different devices &ndash;&nbsp;the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S10</a>, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-plus-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S10 Plus</a>, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10e-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S10e</a>, and the S10 5G! If you&rsquo;re in the market for a brand new phone, it may all be a little confusing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole load of choice. Stuck between the three main S-series models? You&rsquo;ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Before we get down to it, let&rsquo;s take a moment to talk about the exclusive features that all three smartphones share.</p>
<p>Each of the new S10 devices boasts Fast Wireless Charging, Wireless PowerShare (so you can use them to charge other devices quickly and easily!), and a trendy new &lsquo;hole punch&rsquo; selfie cam.</p>
<p>That means that whichever smartphone you choose, you&rsquo;re going to be treated to some of the very latest specs.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to dive into this buyer&rsquo;s guide and look at the major differences between each of the S-series devices.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10e</h2>
<h5>Best for: Your budget</h5>
<p>The most affordable of the new S-series, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10e-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a> is still a premium-looking phone.</p>
<p>The device has a 5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen and 2280x1080 resolution, which means that you&rsquo;re getting a high-quality display here.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&rsquo;t have the curved edge design that we&rsquo;re used to from S-series phones. That means that when you compare it to the S10 or S10 Plus, you will see a difference.</p>
<p>When it comes to the camera, you&rsquo;ve got a dual-lens offering on the rear consisting of a 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel setup.</p>
<p>Rather than having the latest in-screen fingerprint scanner, the S10e is armed with a capacitive fingerprint scanner instead. It&rsquo;s not a huge deal, but may sway some people out there to opt for the slightly more premium device.</p>
<p>When it comes to storage and RAM, there plenty with this device. So, no worries here for video or gaming.</p>
<p>The phone will actually come in four different colours; canary yellow, prism green, prism white, prism black. The starting price is &pound;669.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10</h2>
<h5>Best for: S-series fans</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> is the device that most strongly adheres to the classic S-series range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the premium flagship phone we&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Packing a 6.1-inch AMOLED screen with 3040x1440 resolution, the WQHD+ display is top of the range. That&rsquo;s a 93% curved screen, which sticks to Samsung&rsquo;s signature flagship style.</p>
<p>On the back, the smartphone has three camera lenses; a 12-megapixel wide lens, a 16-megapixel ultra wide lens, and a 12-megapixel zoom lens. All of the above promises some pro-style snaps.</p>
<p>When you compare that to the likes of the S10e cameras, it comes out on top. The Bixby Vision feature has been upgraded to recognise 30 different scenes using AI technology. That should make using the camera a whole new experience.</p>
<p>The smartphone also sports the Exynos 9810 chipset and 8GB RAM which mean that it&rsquo;s pretty darn speedy too. The One UI comes with some updates, which means that the functionality of the phone is better than ever. It will be available in three dazzling colours &ndash; prism green, prism white, prism black. The Galaxy S10 starts at &pound;799.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20204" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TsMCoq1NXlPLyRLaynXpv01johg7zt_fxy85q0VsC4WcejS-VhiJnfHqNunl7kwBBeShRZvSuiiarX5w-GBv4XCW=s0" alt=""></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus</h2>
<h5>Best for: Selfie and phablet lovers</h5>
<p>With a bigger screen, larger battery, and an extra selfie camera, it&rsquo;s clear to see the advantages of the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-plus-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus</a>.</p>
<p>This device is slightly larger than the standard S10 too. The Infinity-O Display comes in at 6.4 inches with the same 3040x1440 resolution that the standard device offers. Needless to say, it has an almost bezeless look.</p>
<p>On the rear, the camera setup is the same as the S10 model &ndash;&nbsp;a 12-megapixel wide lens, a 16-megapixel ultra wide lens, and a 12-megapixel zoom lens. However, the selfie camera has been upgraded somewhat. There are two different lenses on the front. There&rsquo;s both a 10-megapixel and 8-megapixel camera lens, which means that you get a crisper, higher quality snap. Nice.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the screen is bigger and the smartphone has a phablet feel, you can easily use it with one hand. That has to be quite a big advantage, especially given that some smartphones can be uncomfortable to use this way. The price is a little higher, but it&rsquo;s not a massive leap. The starting price is &pound;899.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20206" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cjDP-yv2oHePtRIgaduYtdNOPkXhYZyMZTNAYUzJ6AMZ8Td0me4I5mREH24M-fwof7E91WT-K-UTDBdZryFEvZCgsg=s0" alt=""></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter what your needs, there&rsquo;s sure to be a new S-series model that suits your requirements.</p>
<p>If you want the most affordable device, the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10e-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a> is the one for you. You have to trade off a little here. It has a flat screen and no in-screen fingerprint scanner. However, it&rsquo;s a premium looking device and boasts many of the features of the other S10 phones, which means you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you compare it to the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy S10</a> review, it is a major upgrade. You&rsquo;ve got the addition of the in-screen scanner, an extra ultra wide lens on the rear, and a larger screen too. It&rsquo;s what you expect from a flagship device and the logical step-up from the S10e, which is why the price is a little higher.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to take things to a whole new level, it could be worth looking at the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s10-plus-128gb-black?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus</a>. It has a larger screen, an extra selfie camera and more battery power. These features could be worth the bigger price tag, but it depends on what you need from your phone and how much you will use them.</p>
<p>If you do decide to opt for either the Galaxy S10 or S10 Plus, there&rsquo;s an added bonus for you too. When you pre-order either of these awesome devices on <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net?adnetwork=fcbk&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-article&amp;utm_campaign=which-samsung-should-i-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buymobiles.net</a>, you can also claim a free pair of Galaxy Buds to boot (pre-order ends 7th March).</p>
