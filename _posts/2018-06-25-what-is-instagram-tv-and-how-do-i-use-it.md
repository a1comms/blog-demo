<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">It looks like YouTube could have some tough competition.</span></p>
<p>Could Instagram be taking on the likes of YouTube? Well, maybe. During a special event over in San Francisco, the people behind Instagram launched an exciting stand-alone app that is likely to change the way we use the platform forever. Yes, it&rsquo;s time to say hello to Instagram TV, or IGTV, if you will!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instagram has always been a place to connect with the people who inspire, educate and entertain you every day,&rdquo; says Kevin Systrom, Co-Founder &amp; CEO in an official Instagram <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/06/20/welcome-to-igtv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your help, IGTV begins a new chapter of video on Instagram. We hope it brings you closer to the people and things you love.&rdquo; Sound good? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Hour-Long Video Uploads</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that we <em>all </em>find frustrating about Instagram Stories, it&rsquo;s the fact that you can only upload one-minute videos. Sigh!</p>
<p>Should you want to make a long-form recipe video or simply go on an epic rant about Love Island, you have to keep stopping and starting your clips. It can be a tad annoying, to say the least.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where IGTV is completely different. You could say it&rsquo;s a game-changer. Insta-users will be able to create hour-long video clips that can be watched and enjoyed by anybody online.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17808" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A7hw4djpuy78gYRMGMmBDUVcyLApqIwICVW2jwJ1QkyNFBeAyu_m8IOLA8787xiEW8hRI7HsLfSTwG8KQFSRAffJ7g=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Plus, each user has their own &lsquo;channel&rsquo; (does that sound familiar to anyone?!) and you can &lsquo;follow&rsquo; the ones you love.</p>
<h2>Built with Smartphones in Mind</h2>
<p>One of the major differences that you&rsquo;ll notice when you start using IGTV for yourself is the <em>way </em>that you use it. It&rsquo;s been built with smartphones in mind, which means that the videos are shown in full-screen and are vertical.</p>
<p>That means no more trying to flip your phone around like crazy just to get full-screen mode to work! What&rsquo;s more, the minute you launch the feature or app, the latest videos will start playing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17812" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ODhM3fhm5kmp1lV7iB-_-YPK_YWdhhiSff1IKSnghcqx9szetFVmO6RHaaRyI9pVyQUY-xnHguSBUfQ4pxLzHoP=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to Instagram, this fact means it&rsquo;s &lsquo;just like turning on the TV.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Like, Comment, and Share</h2>
<p>So far, so intriguing, but what about interaction? How can you have your say on some of your favourite videos?</p>
<p>Luckily, the clips and channels will have like and comment features (just like regular posts). As though that wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you excited, there will also be an option to send videos directly to your contacts.</p>
<h2>Simple to Use!</h2>
<p>If you like what you hear, you may be wondering how you can get started. Well, there are two options. IGTV will be a feature within your regular Instagram app, which means that you&rsquo;ll be able to access it from a button on the app&rsquo;s homescreen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17807" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0ANQfB3JcSnd0wZEm3RmLZQ3e3Cst-Wtd1t8swVQiNwWv2rOScx3C7jQOiXXDsU1iThswbS8Lm4zsRgbuPmX3kA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>However, if it turns out that you&rsquo;re a real video addict, you can also get the stand-alone app. Both will allow you to take a peek at the latest clips in seconds. Easy.</p>
