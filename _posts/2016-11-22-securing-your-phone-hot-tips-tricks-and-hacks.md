<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The hackers are out there - and they want your information!</span></p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re just about to launch what&rsquo;s dubbed as &lsquo;the safest Android smartphone in the world&rsquo;, the Blackberry DTEK 60, we thought it would be a good time to have a little chat about phone security. Before you drop off to sleep at the very notion of securing your phone, there&rsquo;s something you should know. You see, smartphone security is ridiculously important!</p>
<p>Think about it. That little device is packed full of your deepest, darkest secrets. From your bank details to your work email account, there&rsquo;s a whole host of stuff you don&rsquo;t want anyone else to get their grubby little hands on. It might be a cliche, but it&rsquo;s honestly better to be safe than sorry! Here are some tricks and tips that you might want to try:</p>
<h2>1) Use Your Fingerprint Password</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlAUYJj_Q7g" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you happen to have a phone that has a fingerprint password, you absolutely must use it. This is perhaps the easiest way to make sure that your phone is safe. While Touch ID is by no means foolproof, it makes it a whole lot harder for hackers to get into your phone should they wish to do so. (Oh, and if you don&rsquo;t have a fingerprint password feature on your phone, make certain you use a passcode that&rsquo;s not your date of birth!)</p>
<h2>2) Lock Your Apps Too</h2>
<p>There are some apps on your phone that you definitely don&rsquo;t want anyone getting into. Having that extra level of security on these apps could make all the difference and means that people will need to try just a little harder if they want to access your information. If you have an Android device, you can download an app such as App Lock which does just what it says on the tin. Once you&rsquo;ve installed it, you can choose specific apps to guard with an extra passcode.</p>

<h2>4) Don&rsquo;t You Dare &lsquo;Jailbreak&rsquo; Your Device</h2>
<p>If you want access to extra apps and features, you may be tempted to &lsquo;jailbreak&rsquo; your phone. Don&rsquo;t do it! It&rsquo;s honestly not worth the trouble. Your phone&rsquo;s information could be accessed remotely should you accidentally download some malware. Once you start downloading unofficial apps or third-party software, you will find that your phone is much more susceptible to viruses and the like.</p>
<h2>5) Encrypt Your Messages</h2>
<p>In general conversation, you could give away things that hackers can use to steal your identity. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s oh-so-important to make sure that you encrypt your messages properly. Apps such as iMessage and WhatsApp do this automatically, and so you needn&rsquo;t worry, but what about the rest of your communications? Well, you can get an app to help you along the way! Bleep not only encrypts all your messages but it also deletes them once they&rsquo;ve been read. Double security? Um, yes please!</p>

<h2>6) Download an Anti-Theft App</h2>
<p>All of the above tips are useful if your phone is under a digital threat from hackers, but what if it&rsquo;s under physical threat? What can you do should someone steal your smartphone? Well, there are actually a few apps that may just help. For example, Prey Anti Theft means that you can control your device remotely even after someone takes it. You can access both the front and back camera, which means that you can take a quick snap of the thief, and also set off a loud and annoying alarm. That ought to teach &lsquo;em a lesson!</p>
