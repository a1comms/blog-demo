<p><span class="postStandFirst">BuyMobiles attended the exclusive launch party of the Sony Xperia Z.</span></p>
<p>Set in an exclusive basement venue in the heart of London, Sony hosted a spectacle of epic proportions to celebrate the launch of the phenomenal&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/sony">Sony Xperia Z</a>&nbsp;flagship handset.</p>
<p>With the main theme of the party set to mimic the stylish outline of the Xperia Z, the emphasis being on colour and sound, Sony pulled out all the stops to ensure that its guests enjoyed the full Xperience!</p>
<p>As expected the Xperia Z was the star of the show, with devices available to sample, and each designed to showcase the unique functions of this stellar device, including camera features and full screen television mirroring.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the unique PhotoBurst feature, Sony created a ball pit for guests to leap into, the point being that the handset takes a rapid succession of action&nbsp;shots in &lsquo;burst&rsquo; mode on the 13 megapixel camera from which you simply pick the best one.</p>
<p>Apart from the fun and quirky aspects of the party, the highlight of the evening was the performance from Madeon, one of Sony&rsquo;s own artists who produced a music spectacle, involving the star himself playing his unique electro-house tunes coupled with an amazing laser show with gigantic robotic arms rhythmically moving to the beats.</p>
<p><strong>Sony created something fresh and innovative with the Xperia Z, and this event was the perfect way to show it off!</strong></p>
