<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is Samsung going to be dethroned as the king of Android?</span></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush. There&rsquo;s no question about Samsung&rsquo;s Android dominance here in the UK. You&rsquo;re not imagining it. A massive amount of consumers own this brand of phone. In fact, a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/387227/market-share-of-smartphone-manufacturers-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> revealed that a whopping 35% of smartphone users in the UK owned a Samsung handset.</p>

<p>Compare that to just 1% of respondents who said they had a Huawei and it&rsquo;s plain to see that the South Korean giant has been storming ahead in recent years. However, with a massive boost in new manufacturers and affordable tech, the tables may be about to turn.</p>
<p>Actually, they already are. Huawei, originally a Chinese manufacturer, has been winning market share from Samsung in abundance in the UK since March 2018, with <a href="https://uk.kantar.com/tech/mobile/2018/huawei-cracks-the-british-smartphone-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kantar Woldpanel ComTech</a> showing that its share jumped to 13.7% over April to June.</p>
<p>Now, another Chinese manufacturer is looking to get in on the rising popularity of more affordable Android mobile phones. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about the brand that launched here in the UK just this month: Xiaomi.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a brand-new Android phone and need a little advice, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s what you should know.</p>
<h2>What You Need Know About Huawei</h2>
<p>For some time, the Huawei brand flew under the radar. With that in mind, it may surprise you to find that this company actually established its mobile phone department a massive 15 years ago, in 2003.</p>
<p>Since then, the manufacturer has of course been developing its range of smartphones, selling them mostly to the huge population in its home country of China.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that this brand went from being a lesser-known one to a strong contender in the global industry, <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/huawei-overtakes-apple-to-become-the-second-largest-mobile-manufacturer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtaking Apple as the world&rsquo;s second biggest mobile phone manufacturer</a>.</p>
<p>The latest devices &ndash;&nbsp;such as the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/meet-your-new-best-mates-huawei-mate-20-and-mate-20-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/reviews/is-the-huawei-p20-pro-camera-actually-as-good-as-they-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei P20 Pro</a> &ndash;&nbsp;have become major flagship devices, competing directly with Samsung&rsquo;s once dominant foothold in the market.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s all the fuss about? Well, not only have the latest devices been leading the way in terms of design (think minimal, sleek looks!) but they boast market-leading technology. Namely flashy triple-lens camera setups, reverse wireless charging and facial recognition technology, as all present on the Mate 20 Pro.</p>
<h2>What You Need to Know About Xiaomi</h2>
<p>While you&rsquo;re probably now familiar with Huawei, the chances of you knowing much about Xiaomi (<a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/reviews/who-is-xiaomi-and-how-good-are-its-mobile-phones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or even how to pronounce it!</a>) are relatively low.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46140487" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC reports</a> that the brand is the fourth best-selling smartphone manufacturer in the world. Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason that most of us haven&rsquo;t heard of this brand is no major secret. Before now, Xiaomi had never released a smartphone in the UK. However, as of 8 November 2018, that all changed with a range of Xiaomi mobile phones all arriving on our fair shores.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEdtnuyj9zo" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Entering the market with snazzy handsets &ndash;&nbsp;such as the Xiaomi Mi 8 and the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/reviews/who-is-xiaomi-and-how-good-are-its-mobile-phones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-fast Xiaomi Pocophone F1</a> &ndash;&nbsp;the brand is on a mission to bring affordable flagships to the country. Hurrah!</p>
<p>With a reputation for lower-cost technology, it&rsquo;s worth keeping your eye on what this particular company has in store.</p>
<h2>Time to Make a Switch?</h2>
<p>Should the people over at Samsung be shaking in their boots? Well, maybe.</p>
<p>However, for you guys, the more competition there is out there, the better. It means that the chances of you nabbing a stellar device at a lower price are seriously high.</p>
<p>So, which Android mobile phone manufacturer should you choose? Well, that decision is 100% yours. Click the banner below to browser our Xiaomi mobile phone deals.</p>
