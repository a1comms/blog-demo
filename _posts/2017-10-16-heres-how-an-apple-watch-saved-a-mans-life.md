<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Life-saving notifications? There&rsquo;s an app for that!</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s proof that wearable technology can be life-saving. An app on the Apple Watch recently helped save one man&rsquo;s life by alerting him to the fact he needed immediate medical attention.</p>
<p>The man, it turned out, had a blood clot in his lungs that would&rsquo;ve been fatal had he not got the help that he needed.</p>
<p>James Green, a 28-year-old reporter and podcaster from Brooklyn, was using the HeartWatch app at the time of the incident. The handy health app monitors a user's heart rate throughout the day, and gives alerts should it go above or below certain levels.</p>
<p>Green had previously had an embolism (a blockage inside a blood vessel), which is what prompted using the app. &ldquo;I wanted data on my heart since I had a previous pulmonary embolism,&rdquo; he told the Telegraph. &ldquo;And my watch is too old to have the new software update that enabled the heart rate alerts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to the app (and some quick thinking on Green&rsquo;s part), he is still alive today. When HeartWatch began giving alerts about an unexpectedly high heart rate, he knew that something was amiss. He later credited the app with saving his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got an alert from Heart Watch that my heart rate was continually above my resting heart rate of 54, even when I was just sitting at my desk,&rdquo; Green explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That along with other symptoms I was having was enough data I needed to act on it, and realise it wasn&rsquo;t a panic attack (since I have severe generalised anxiety), that it was something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeking medical help, a CT scan revealed that Green had a dangerous blood clot in his lungs. It was then that he was transferred to a hospital, given further ultrasound scans, and then finally attached to a blood thinner drip to deal with the problem. Doctors reportedly told him that it would've been &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; has he waited any longer.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thanks! Also wow! This is so fantastic that you are ok. Humbled to have played a part. Wishing you a rapid recovery &amp; best of future health.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the data I needed to prove this wasn&rsquo;t just a panic attack. It helped me get the ball rolling,&rdquo; said Green, who later tweeted the HeartWatch app company to thank them for their help in literally saving his life.</p>
