<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Need some #MondayMotivation? Check out this sweet deal.</span></p>
<p>The working week has started once again (sigh!), which means that many of us are down in the dumps. If you&rsquo;ve got a case of the Monday blues, we think that we might just have the cure for you. Let&rsquo;s take a look at one of the best phone deals you can get right now.</p>
<p>Question: How would you like to bag yourself 5GB extra data per month, at no extra cost? Think about it &ndash; the possibilities would be endless. From watching funny videos on YouTube to streaming your favourite Spotify playlists without having to download it first, the sky&rsquo;s the limit.</p>
<p>If that sounds like your idea of heaven and you&rsquo;re thinking of getting a brand-new phone, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. There&rsquo;s a cheeky little deal available right now, which would mean you&rsquo;d have a high-tech handset and loads of data. Here&rsquo;s what you should know.</p>
<h2>Huawei P20 Pro, P20, and P20 Lite</h2>
<p>Fast becoming one of the biggest names in the world of tech, Huawei has seriously upped its game in the smartphone department. The <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P20</a>, and P20 Lite are signs of the changing times &ndash;&nbsp;let&rsquo;s call it a new era in the brand&rsquo;s history (or future?).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6e0zbPxac0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>With a stunning all-screen design, minimal notch, and an effortlessly elegant design, there&rsquo;s just so much to adore here. What&rsquo;s more, the displays are killer as they all boast FHD+ resolution (1080 x 2244 pixels), which makes them perfect for streaming videos.</p>
<p>Oh, and Instagram fans will be pleased to know that the cameras on these phones are seriously good. The P20 includes a 24-megapixel front-facing camera and a 20-megapixel f/1.6 camera on the monochrome side. Plus, the Pro edition sports a fancy Leica triple-camera setup on the rear too.</p>
<h2>How to Get 5GB of Extra Data</h2>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, Vodafone's plans include unlimited calls and texts already. That means that when you add an extra 5GB of data to the mix, it&rsquo;s a pretty sweet deal. To nab yourself the free data, all you need to do is get yourself a Huawei device, such as the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/contract/huawei-p20-black/vodafone-red-extra-4gb-35-24mths-huawei-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">snazzy little P20</a>, on a Vodafone tariff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! The extra data will be automatically added to your plan with no extra cost. Nice. You might want to get a move on, because this data offer is finishing on 4 June. All good things must come to an end!</p>
