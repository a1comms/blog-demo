<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Here's how to get free coding this December.</span></p>
<p>If you could travel back in time 20 years, what would you do? Aside from buying stocks in Apple, there&rsquo;s just one other thing I&rsquo;d do: learn to code. Knowing how to code apps and websites is probably one of the most useful tech skills in the modern age. With that knowledge, you can go anywhere in the world and get a job at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Since most of the population has very little clue how this all works (myself included!), those who do have the skill are like the magicians of our time. Only they know the secrets - and they&rsquo;ll never tell no matter how much you beg them.</p>
<h2>Apple&rsquo;s Hour of Code Workshops</h2>
<p>Luckily, Apple will. As part of Computer Science Education Week, the tech giant have decided to give us all the most brilliant gift we could hope for this Christmas. That&rsquo;s right, on the 5th and 11th December, the geniuses at Apple will be hosting some Hour of Code Workshops at a whopping 487 stores around the globe.</p>
<p>The workshops are just as they sound. They're an hour long, and will teach the general public the basics of coding. Suitable for both adult novices and kiddies too, the sessions will give us all a taste of the art form, revealing how you can learn a coding language for yourself.</p>

<h2>Download the Swift Playgrounds App Right Now</h2>
<p>Plus, if you are hoping to take your little ones along with you, it&rsquo;s well worth downloading the exclusive Swift Playgrounds app ahead of time. The easy-to-use app will offer your children a small introduction to coding and how it all works. (And, if you want to use the app too, we won&rsquo;t tell a soul!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coding is just like any language, the earlier you're exposed the more successful you'll be," explained Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. "Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity."</p>

<h2>So, How Can I Sign Up?</h2>
<p>Typical of Apple, signing up to an Hour of Coding Workshop couldn't be easier. Just head to the tech company's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/code/" target="_blank">website</a> and locate the nearest store that's hosting a session. You can then choose which coding workshop you&rsquo;d like to attend. Yeah, it actually is that easy! What&rsquo;s more, they're 100% free. So, if you&rsquo;ve been thinking about taking up a new skill, you&rsquo;ve really got no excuse now.</p>
