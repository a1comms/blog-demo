<p><span class="postStandFirst">HTC has unleashed a handset to conquer all &ndash; the HTC One is tipped to be the hottest new handset for an all-new smartphone experience!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8515282979_259cf71319.jpg" alt="HTC One" width="281" height="500" /><br />
</strong>Encased in aluminium, and measuring in at just 9.3mm thin, the&nbsp;HTC One&nbsp;launches running on Android 4.1.2, otherwise known as Jelly Bean, although the 4.2.2 update is already on the cards for release shortly.</p>
<p>Featuring a 4.7 inch Super LCD 3 touchscreen of 1080p resolution, and made from strengthened Corning Gorilla Glass 2, the graphics on the HTC One are incredible, offering a whopping 469 ppi pixel density. What&rsquo;s more, the bezels surrounding the screen are super-slim, ensuring optimum viewing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 chipset, and utilising a quad-core 1.7GHz Krait 300 processor, the handset also features Adreno 320 graphics 2GB of RAM. Simply put, it houses a veritable powerhouse underneath the hood which will make multi-tasking a breeze. Add a 2300mAh battery to the mix, and you have a seriously powerful smartphone which can still go the distance.<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8515292885_95ab0e2040.jpg" alt="HTC One" width="500" height="465" /></p>
<p>The handset also premieres HTC Sense 5, the custom user-interface of choice. With a redesigned home screen, featuring live &lsquo;tiles&rsquo;, the phone is able to stream live social networking updates and news feeds on its vertically scrollable screen, meaning users will be kept bang up-to-date.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest innovation on the HTC One is the camera. Remembering that &lsquo;bigger does not always mean better&rsquo; a four megapixel snapper may appear to be a pretty poor offering, however this is a camera with a difference as it features Ultrapixels which are much larger than the ones found in most other smartphones and have a vastly-improved per-pixel quality and lets in up to 300% more light, meaning shooting in dimmer conditions will never be an issue again. Not only this, but pressing the shutter doesn&rsquo;t just take one image&hellip; it takes 20, as well as a three second video, meaning that your photo album can truly come to life.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, the HTC One features dual-frontal speakers powered by built-in amplifiers to deliver bigger sound with less distortion and much more detail.</p>
