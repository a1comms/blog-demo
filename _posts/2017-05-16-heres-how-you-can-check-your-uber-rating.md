<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">And how to improve it.</span></p>
<p>We all know the drill with Uber, right? After you&rsquo;ve completed a trip with a driver, you get an option to &lsquo;rate&rsquo; them. The power feels incredible &mdash; you get the chance to give your driver a score which will affect their overall rating on the app. The buzz is real. But wait&hellip; There&rsquo;s one thing that you might not know.</p>
<p>Are you ready for this one? Uber drivers can rate you right back. *Boom* - your mind has just been blown. While most people don&rsquo;t know about this feature, the drivers have their own rating system and once they&rsquo;ve dropped you off, they can give you a score out of five stars. We&rsquo;re basically living in a Black Mirror episode, you guys.</p>
<h2>How to Check Your Uber Rating</h2>
<p>So, do you want to know your score? It might seem a little scary, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re curious about it, right? Well, luckily for you, there&rsquo;s an ever-so-easy way to find out what people have rated you in the past. It just takes a couple of minutes and it&rsquo;s the same on both Android and iOS devices. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your Uber app</li>
<li>Make sure you&rsquo;re signed in</li>
<li>Click the â˜° button in the top left corner</li>
<li>Look just beneath your username</li>
</ol>
<p>There you will find a number next to a star. Realistically, anything above the 4.5 mark is pretty darn decent, especially if you happen to be a frequent Uber user. After all, it only takes a couple of drivers to mark you down to bring your average rating down a little.</p>
<h2>How to Boost Your Rating</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your low, low rating, there are some ways that you can improve it. (Be aware that this will take some time as you will need a load of people to give you five stars so you can bring the average up!). Still, Uber offers some handy advice on how to get top marks from your drivers. Here are some takeaway points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t keep your driver waiting </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When your driver arrives, you should be right there, waiting for them. You need to make sure that you type in the right pickup point and that you&rsquo;re there when they are.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be polite!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This one really should go without saying, but you need to be polite to your driver. Being positive, nice, and friendly will get you far in this game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be as safe as possible </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wear a seatbelt (duh!) and don&rsquo;t go asking your driver to speed so you can get somewhere on time. It just won&rsquo;t do. Your driver wants to be safe&hellip; and so should you.</p>
<p>If you follow these above rules, you should find that your rating soars in no time at all. Oh, and if you&rsquo;ve had a few drinks before you get in your Uber, try to hold it together. Swearing, puking, and asking your driver to take you through a Maccy&rsquo;s drive-thru is sure to knock your score down. It may be obvious, but it&rsquo;s true. Good luck.</p>
