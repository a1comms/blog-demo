<p><span class="postStandFirst">Facebook Messenger &ndash; the app that everyone has, but really wishes they didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no doubt that if you haven&rsquo;t already been strong-armed into downloading it, you soon will be. That being said, we have a solution for you.</span></p>
<p>Last April, Mark Zuckerberg and his team of sweater dwelling, flip-flop donning computer wizards announced that they would be moving Facebook users&rsquo; inbox messages over to the Facebook Messenger app.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-4891 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/The-Social-Network.jpg" alt="The Social Network" width="760" height="511" /></p>

<p>In other words, if Facebook users want to check their inbox via their iPhone 5s or Samsung Galaxy S5 etc., they have to either unwillingly download the Facebook Messenger app, or use the web version of Facebook (which is, of course, rather tedious and more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth on a smartphone).</p>
<p>So with these somewhat domineering measures in place, Facebook Messenger is now the number one downloaded app, with more than 200 million monthly users. Things are, however, not quite as well as they seem; you only have to visit the App Store to see just how discontented the masses are, after being pressured into downloading Facebook Messenger, as it boasts a paltry one star.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img class=" wp-image-4893 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/08/Facebook-Messenger-1024x919.jpg" alt="Facebook Messenger" width="768" height="689" /></p>

<p>With a much more encouraging four stars, things are looking better for Facebook Messenger on Google Play. On the face of things, it looks as though Android users are a little less disgruntled than their iOS counterparts.</p>
<p>But the reason for this chasm in customer satisfaction is down to Google Play&rsquo;s star ratings, which are cumulative from the first version of an app; whereas the App Store displays the star ratings for the <em>latest</em> version.</p>
<p>Based on some of the reactions (including my own) that are fluttering around on Twitter, I&rsquo;ve concluded that the rating on the App Store offers a more reliable consensus&hellip;</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re not feeling particularly grateful about Facebook trying to govern what apps you download, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up your Facebook app and navigate to your inbox. You&rsquo;ll receive an irksome, but ever so informative, alert, telling you that your messages have moved over to Facebook Messenger. Oh, and look, all of your friends have already jumped on board! Great&hellip; You&rsquo;ll then be asked if you want to install it. Confirm.</li>
<li>Whilst Facebook Messenger is downloading/installing go to the App Store or Google Play, and quickly stop the process before it completes.</li>
<li>Return to the Facebook app and your messages will be available once again, in their original, familiar home.</li>
<li>Finally, smile and pray that Facebook doesn't discover this loophole.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s the thing; how long will this sneaky solution allow us to furtively escape the clutches of Facebook Messenger? We just don&rsquo;t know. Sadly, this may only be a provisional fix, but for all of the freedom fighters out there, who live by their own rules and want to stick it to the Man, enjoy it whilst it lasts!</strong></p>
