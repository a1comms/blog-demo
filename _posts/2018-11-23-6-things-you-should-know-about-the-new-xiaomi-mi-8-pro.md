<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Spoiler: There&rsquo;s a little surprise on the back!</span></p>
<p>Have you heard of the new Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro? If not, you&rsquo;re probably not alone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/reviews/who-is-xiaomi-and-how-good-are-its-mobile-phones">Xiaomi line of phones</a> are new to the UK market. But they&rsquo;re sure to take the country by storm.</p>
<p>Coming in at an affordable price and offering some seriously high-tech features, there&rsquo;s a whole load to love here. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to take a look at one of the best on offer &ndash;&nbsp;the Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro.</p>
<p>Here are six things you need to know first.</p>
<h2>1) It Has a Cool, Transparent Back</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19546" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TC4syxtqZB2ob16xLgxu6J6skweE-6KG4XfRooNktNX3LhUUub7Z3DyAOkl7ClagOEWFCnBlrfXEGGazFHMiX5V3=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The design is minimal and cool. You&rsquo;ve got the slick, stripped back style on the front with an almost all-screen look. But it doesn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>Flip the phone over to the back and it&rsquo;s a whole different ball game. There&rsquo;s a little transparent panel, through which you can see the inner workings of the phone. Well, actually, you can see dummy chips; the real ones are not visible. Still, it&rsquo;s a fun gimmick! The rest of the design is relatively basic but it&rsquo;s enough to do the job &ndash;&nbsp;plain and simple.</p>
<h2>2) The Screen is Pretty Huge</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19549" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4F4dn-EN2ty-ncGnj8UilmeOXTpSojZOqgZGqRDq4uVpNqCUAK3VRU-wRVkofc-CAHuB1wK1kOWamCXFm0kZhA6dMg=s0" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Of course, these days, mobile phone displays are all about size. It matters.</p>
<p>Luckily, Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro comes in with a pretty sizable 6.21-inch AMOLED display. There&rsquo;s also an 18.7:9 aspect ratio which gives you a great viewing platform for video and games.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you&rsquo;re not going to be disappointed here; the Full HD resolution should be enough for most people. Of course, there are Quad HD displays out there in the market if you want to go the extra mile.</p>
<h2>3) It Boasts an In-Screen Fingerprint Scanner</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bVRzApm2bTT6OL2DH54wKhA87Ij-Gwa_YFgROrP8am-gEkz2A28KDNJ3SV5asPilNYxDibcR8oGIeaBD5h2iRU2f=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So what about smartphone security then?</p>
<p>Well, much like most of the high-end mobiles on the market, the security is top notch. There&rsquo;s an in-display fingerprint scanner, which you can use to unlock the phone in an instant.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&rsquo;t end there. If you don&rsquo;t fancy using the fingerprint technology, there&rsquo;s also face unlock too. While the face scanner isn&rsquo;t quite as high-end as, let&rsquo;s say Apple, it&rsquo;s still pretty snazzy.</p>
<h2>4) The Cameras Are Made by Sony and Samsung</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/630swagb-BjUupi1fbWvqQQ2PuRJUJDqrAAFUIFiupP7o_PksraAGXiy1UoeSJhmtSPZXHNfxNBhsNKWZteId8w=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fancy bagging a premium smartphone camera? You&rsquo;re in luck.</p>
<p>Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro has two 12MP cameras on the rear setup &ndash;&nbsp;one of which is made by Sony and the second by Samsung.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 2x zoom effect in the Camera app for getting closer to the action. And as though that wasn&rsquo;t enough, there are oodles of features to choose from, including portrait mode and more. It&rsquo;s a fun little camera package.</p>
<h2>5) The Operating System Feels Unique</h2>
<p>When it comes to user experience, there are a few things that you should know.</p>
<p>You get the Android 8.1 Oreo operating system, which may not be the latest (Android 9 Pie is), but still packs a serious punch with plenty of enhancing features.</p>
<p>Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro also boasts the Mi UI overlay, making the interface feel entirely unique. It&rsquo;s colourful and playful at the same time. Unlike other Android interfaces, there&rsquo;s no app drawer here at all. Everything lives on the home screen.</p>
<h2>6) Gamers Might Just Fall in Love With It</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real trend emerging among modern-day mobile phones&hellip;</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s all about gaming.</p>
<p>Luckily, when it comes to power, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed here at all. Under the hood, there&rsquo;s the very latest Snapdragon 845 chipset with a remarkable 8GB of RAM. It&rsquo;s a super speedy combo.</p>
<p>That means that the device should be well tailored to some of the latest games and apps. Of course, you&rsquo;ll have to test it for yourself to find out!</p>
