<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Possibly the two best value-for-money smartphones.</span></p>
<p>The new year brings some very exciting news for Samsung lovers. If you fancy nabbing yourself a snazzy-looking Galaxy handset but are on a tight post-Christmas budget, there&rsquo;s just the thing. The latest budget phones, Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017), are set to launch early this year.</p>
<p>Aside from the flagship handsets that typically come in any given year, Samsung now offers a mid-range and value-for-money product to accompany. Both new low-cost smartphones offer comparable features and design to the top-end Galaxy S7, but won&rsquo;t even come close to breaking the bank. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>A More Affordable Galaxy S7</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of the Galaxy S7, we have some great news for you. The design of the two latest Samsung phones is just as stunning as the brand&rsquo;s flagship model. The Galaxy A3 and A5 (2017) come complete with same signature metal frame, glass back and stylish look.</p>

<p>Like many modern handsets, the Galaxy A3 and A5 (2017) will be available in a dazzling array of colours. In fact, customers will be able to choose from Blue Mist, Gold Sand, Black Sky and, wait for it&hellip; Peach Cloud.</p>
<h2>The Three Best Features</h2>
<p>But enough about looks. What can you expect in the way of handset features, if you get yourself one of these amazing value Samsung smartphones, eh? Here&rsquo;s a cheeky little rundown for you:</p>
<p><strong>They&rsquo;re Water Resistant</strong></p>
<p>Rather surprisingly (given the low cost of these handsets), both the Galaxy A3 and A5 (2017) will actually be dust and water resistant. The main shout here is that both can be submerged in water for a whopping 30 minutes and still work afterwards! Accidental drop in the toilet? Just dry it off. And maybe give it a wash&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>They Have </strong><strong>Fingerprint Scanners </strong></p>
<p>Just because these phones come with a budget price tag, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that Samsung has scrimped on features. Quite the opposite. The fingerprint scanner, which is now extremely popular amongst higher-end devices, is one of the major perks of these two new Samsungs.</p>
<p><strong>Their Cameras Are Totally Awesome</strong></p>
<p>While both smartphones feature amazing cameras, there is a <em>slight</em> difference in quality. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) boasts a 13MP rear and an 8MP front camera, while the Galaxy A5 (2017) outshines with an impressive 16MP camera on both sides. The front-facing cameras are accompanied by new hands-free snapping functionality for all of your selfies.</p>
<h2>Fast and Faster</h2>
<p>Of course, before you set your heart on one of these handsets, you need to know just what you&rsquo;re getting for your money. Samsung Galaxy A3 and A5 (2017) will run Android Marshmallow out of the box, the last but one generation from Google. That&rsquo;s where the similarities begin and end because there are a few differences in terms of power and storage here.</p>
<p>Samsung A3 2017 boasts a decent 1.6GHz octa-core chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. If you want something a little more powerful, Samsung A5 2017 comes with a 1.9GHz octa-core chip, 3GB of RAM, and a large 32GB of storage. You can boost your storage on both handsets, though, up to 256GB via a microSD card.</p>
<h2>Save the Date</h2>
<p>Of course, the thing that you&rsquo;re certain to be wondering right now is when you can nab one of these handsets. Well, you won&rsquo;t actually have to wait all that long. Hurrah! Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) are scheduled for a 2 February launch.</p>
