<p><span class="postStandFirst">A new budget-friendly Nexus phone is rumoured to be in development, and it is said to be powered by a 64-bit processor from Chinese chip-maker MediaTek. While it won&rsquo;t have the power of top-end flagships like the HTC One M8 or Samsung Galaxy S5, the budget Nexus phone may well be able to offer the same value for money as the Moto G.</span></p>
<p>Since its inception, the Nexus range of smartphones has been a vessel for the "pure Google experience"; it&rsquo;s also been home to some of the most powerful phones on the market, but now, it seems like the Nexus range may be about to diversify.</p>
<p>According to G4Games, a new budget Nexus phone is rumoured to be on the way, but instead of being designed to take on top-end flagships like the HTC One M8 or the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s5">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, this new Nexus device will purportedly be a mid-range phone.</p>
<p>What sets it apart, though, is that it&rsquo;s rumoured to have a brand new processor made by Chinese manufacturer MediaTek. While this processor will be cheaper to use than, say, a Snapdragon chip, it&rsquo;s rumoured to be a surprisingly high-end chip, which will be at least quad-core, and which will, quite shockingly, have <em>64-bit</em> architecture (just like the iPhone 5s).</p>
<p>In a mid-range phone, that&rsquo;s a surprising feature indeed!</p>
<p>Of course, we must bear <em>two</em> things in mind when contemplating this rumour: firstly, it is just a rumour, right now, so until official information is forthcoming, we need to take it with a pinch of salt; and secondly, even if the rumour is true, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that this mid-range budget Nexus phone will reach British shores. Google has long wanted to get back into China, and a MediaTek-powered phone could be the key to doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Still, if it <em>is</em> true, then we could have a phone on our hands that can finally match the value for money offered by the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-phones/motorola/motorola-moto-g">Moto G</a>. We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this story, so stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
