<p>Planning to get yourself the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-gold">iPhone Xs,</a>&nbsp;Xs Max&nbsp;or <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xr-64gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone XR</a>? Or have you already bagged yours and just want to know how to get more out of it?</p>
<p>These brand new Apple devices come with some rather cool new features that you&rsquo;re going to want to get your head around as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So, where on earth should you start? Luckily, Apple has the answer! The team released a short video online that gives you the down-low.</p>
<p>From how to navigate your new iPhone to how to use the dual SIM feature, the clip gives you all the information you could possibly need in one neat little package. Watch it here:</p>

<h2>Getting Around iPhone Xs and XR</h2>
<p>Since the new iPhone models no longer have a home button, you may wonder how you can open and move around your phone. Of course, it&rsquo;s hardly rocket science. During the video, you can find out how to swipe up to open your phone and use touches to move around. Basically, the video will give you all the tools you could possibly need to start using your brand new iPhone the moment you unbox it.</p>
<h2>Face ID on iPhone Xs and XR</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re totally new to the world of Face ID, the quick video will give you all the details you need. Setting up the security feature is perhaps the hardest part of the whole thing (and even that is painfully simple!). The clip shows you how to get it right the first time around. Next up, you get some helpful hints when it comes to <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/how-to/how-to-set-up-and-use-face-id-on-iphone-x-and-later-generations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to use Face ID</a> to do various tricks on your new iPhone. It&rsquo;s that easy!</p>
<h2>Depth Control on iPhone Xs and XR</h2>
<p>One of the most impressive features when it comes to the iPhone Xs, Xs Max, and XR is the camera. Apple have no qualms telling you all about how awesome its latest offering is. If the depth control feature has you feeling a little muddled, this video has you covered. You will learn how to use it properly to take an amazing portrait shot. Nice.</p>

<h2>Dual SIM on iPhone Xs and&nbsp;XR</h2>
<p>In all the hype, there&rsquo;s one new Apple feature that you might have overlooked. If you want to have two phone numbers in your iPhone, you can. That means that you no longer need to carry around your work and personal device. You can consolidate and combine them into one handy phone &ndash; if you want to! When you get an incoming call, you get a small note under the caller ID that tells you which number they are calling you on. Give it a go.</p>
