<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Will Apple's Android-mocking adverts make you switch to iPhone?</span></p>
<p>Ask yourself one simple question: What do the geniuses at <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a> want more than anything else? Well, the answer is glaringly obvious - they want all those pesky Android users out there to switch devices and join the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank">iPhone</a> revolution. Duh!</p>
<p>Of course, this is something that Apple has been trying to convince us all to do since the first iPhone launched. Still, it seems that the tech mega-company has recently decided to up its game in a bid to sway people&hellip; and has done so at Android&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<h2>The Apple &lsquo;Switch&rsquo; Page</h2>
<p>So, what are the good people at Apple doing to try to convince people to make the leap? Well, recently, it launched a &lsquo;<a href="https://www.apple.com/switch/" target="_blank">Switch</a>&rsquo; webpage. The aim seems to be: calm any fears around making the move from Android to Apple. Here&rsquo;s just a snippet:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you. That means things like your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps &mdash; including Google Apps. And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>New iPhone Adverts</h2>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the only way Apple&rsquo;s trying to lure people into switching to an iPhone. On Monday, the company released a series of new adverts to the same effect. In each 15-second video, Apple gives a reason why it thinks that the iPhone is, indeed, a superior choice to &lsquo;your phone&rsquo;, i.e. Android or Windows.</p>
<p>So, what adverts can you look out for? Well, there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Security&rsquo; video takes a dig at Android for supposed vulnerability to data theft. Then there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Smooth&rsquo; advert, which shows off iPhone&rsquo;s silky performance, next to a laggy one. And&nbsp;the &lsquo;Contacts&rsquo; advert reveals how easy it is to switch from Android to iOS.</p>
<p>Are these Apple adverts enough to sway you?</p>
