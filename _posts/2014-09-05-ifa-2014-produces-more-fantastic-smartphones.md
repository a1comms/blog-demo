<p><span class="postStandFirst">We&rsquo;ve already seen what Sony and Samsung have shown off at IFA 2014, but what about everyone else? What have other manufacturers like Motorola, HTC and Nokia brought to the party? Let&rsquo;s take a look!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>IFA 2014 is in full swing, and we&rsquo;ve seen some rather high profile smartphones show their faces to the public; we&rsquo;ve seen new offerings from both Sony and Samsung, but there are more manufacturers out there than just those two.</p>
<p>So, what other cool new stuff have we seen at IFA 2014?</p>
<h2>Motorola</h2>
<p>First up, we have a couple of sequels, although they&rsquo;re a specific <i>type</i> of sequel, namely the kind that has the exact same name as its predecessor (although for the sake of not being utterly confusing, we&rsquo;ll stick a &ldquo;2014&rdquo; on the end of each name). Yes, the Moto X 2014 and the Moto G 2014 have made their debut!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the Moto G 2014 first, and in spite of sharing the same name, a few key improvements have been made, to offer even <i>more</i> value for money. While the processor (a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400) and the battery (a 2070mAh battery) remain the same, the Moto G 2014 comes with stereo speakers on the front of the phone, a bigger 8MP camera and, most excitingly of all, a microSD slot so you can expand your internal memory for extra pictures, videos and music. In short, the best budget phone in the universe just got even better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Moto X 2014 has also been updated, but rather than aiming for mid-range smartness, Motorola has aimed this one squarely at the superphone market. Thus, it has a 5.2-inch 1080p screen, a bigger 13MP camera, and a hugely faster Snapdragon 801 processor, clocked to 2.5GHz. Oh, and the voice control has been beefed up, allowing you to now choose your own voice prompt to interact with the phone, instead of having to say &ldquo;OK Google&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basically, imagine all the genuine intelligence that made the first Moto X so compelling, then imagine it in the body of a fully-fledged superphone.</p>
<p>And <i>then</i>, imagine how excited we are to try it out...</p>

<h2>HTC</h2>
<p>Next up is Taiwanese manufacturer HTC, who hasn&rsquo;t launched a new top-end phone. Instead, it has launched a new mid-ranger, but it&rsquo;s a mid-ranger that nonetheless seems to be a little intriguing. It&rsquo;s called the HTC Desire 820, and it is, quite simply, the company&rsquo;s first <i>64-bit</i> phone. We&rsquo;re not entirely sure why HTC would use a mid-ranger as its first 64-bit phone, but given that the specs feel at least a little bit high-end, it&rsquo;s probably not a huge surprise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at an octa-core Snapdragon 816 processor and 2GB of RAM, plus a 5.5-inch 720p screen and a 13MP camera, so we&rsquo;re going to go out on a limb and call this a mid-range superphone. Don&rsquo;t prove us wrong, HTC!</p>

<h2>Nokia</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to a phone that, unlike all the others on this list, is <em>not</em> powered by Android. No, what we&rsquo;re looking at here is the next entrant into the Windows Phone pantheon - the Nokia Lumia 730. All in all, the specs are pretty nice, with a 4.7-inch screen and a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor, but what makes the Nokia Lumia 730 interesting is how Microsoft&rsquo;s positioning it in the market.</p>
<p>In short, with a 5MP camera on the front of the phone, it&rsquo;s being billed as a&ldquo;selfie phone&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll see how well it takes off, but with that selfie camera and the funky colours it&rsquo;ll be available in, we can see it taking off!</p>

<p><strong>Yes, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. With these beauties, and the new stuff we&rsquo;ve seen from Sony and Samsung, this year&rsquo;s IFA is turning out to be a successful one. We can&rsquo;t wait to get our hands on these and see how they perform in the real world!&nbsp;</strong></p>
