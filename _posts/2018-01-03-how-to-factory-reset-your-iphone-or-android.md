<p>Is your phone clogged up with all kinds of nonsense that you no longer need? Or are you looking to sell your phone, and make sure all your data is wiped and removed first?</p>
<p>From apps and games, to old photos and loads of contacts, the amount of stuff on your device may feel a tad overwhelming! Going through and deleting it all, app by app, contact by contact, would simply be too much hassle to ever complete.</p>
<p>Never fear. When all else fails, you can factory reset your phone, removing and erasing everything in one go. Quickly and easily. Here&rsquo;s how to do just that:</p>
<h2>How to Factory Reset Your iPhone or iPad</h2>
<p>Resetting your iPhone or iPad isn&rsquo;t as hard as you may imagine. Apple has made the reset function system easy to find, and easy to use. All you need to do is follow these simple steps to get started:</p>
<p><strong>1) Back Up Your Phone</strong></p>
<p>Back up your iPhone or iPad onto a Mac or via iCloud (should you have it set up already). If you have a load of photos or music that you want to keep safe, this is the best possible option. You can even save your text messages, contacts and apps.</p>
<p><strong>2) Head to &lsquo;Factory Reset&rsquo; </strong></p>

<p>Next, you need to head to the &lsquo;Factory Reset&rsquo; feature on your iPhone or iPad. Go to <strong>Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings</strong>. Once you&rsquo;ve hit that last setting, you just need to do one final thing&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>3) Enter Your Passcode</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you may or may not be asked to enter your passcode to confirm that you&rsquo;d like to erase all your data. Some version of iOS may ask for your Apple ID password as well, so be ready for that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re done! After you&rsquo;ve gone through this process, you should find that your iPhone or iPad reboots, and is as good as new once again. Hurrah!</p>
<h2>How to Factory Reset Your Android Phone</h2>
<p>Of course, resetting your Android smartphone may vary from phone to phone. However, in general, here are the basic steps that you should follow. There are just two:</p>
<p><strong>1) Back Up Your Phone</strong></p>
<p>You may have a whole load of things on your Android smartphone that you want to keep for all of eternity. Should that be the case, make sure that you&rsquo;ve backed up your phone. You could save your pictures to your computer and make sure that you have your music stored somewhere safe.</p>
<p><strong>2) Head to &lsquo;Factory Reset&rsquo; </strong></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re 100% sure that you want to reset your Android phone, the process is pretty simple. Go to <strong>Settings > Backup and Reset > Factory Data Reset > Reset Phone > Erase Everything</strong><em>. </em>Then, you should find that the phone restores to its original settings. Simple!</p>
<p><em>Note: the name of settings might differ from one Android smartphone to the next, but look for similarly named instructions.</em></p>
