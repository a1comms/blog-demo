<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Black Friday is coming!</span></p>
<p>Calling all bargain-hunters! The most wonderful time of the year is almost upon us. Yes, you guessed it, the pre-Christmas sale season is just around the corner. That means that you&rsquo;d better be ready ahead of time if you&rsquo;re going to get the biggest deals. Here&rsquo;s just about everything that you need to know.</p>
<h2>When is Black Friday (and Cyber Monday)?</h2>
<p>Wondering when you can snag some amazing deals? You won&rsquo;t have to wait that long. This year&rsquo;s Black Friday lands on Friday 23rd November while Cyber Monday comes right afterwards on Monday 26th November. If you&rsquo;re in the market for one of the latest new smartphones, waiting until these crucial dates could be the way to go.</p>
<p>At Buymobiles, we&rsquo;re going to have some serious treats coming your way. Our dedicated <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/black-friday">deals page</a> will have all the deets about the offers we have in store for you when the time comes.</p>
<p>Checking it on the big day (well, days!) means that you will be the first to know all about the epic discounts and deals we&rsquo;ve got for you.</p>
<h2>What Smartphones Will Be on Offer?</h2>
<p>While there&rsquo;s going to be a wide range of deals available, which ones should you be keeping your eyes peeled for? Ah, we&rsquo;re glad you asked. Let&rsquo;s take a look at three of the best phones out there right now and why you might want to keep them in mind when the most important shopping days of the year finally come around.</p>
<h5>iPhone XR</h5>
<p>Available in six different colours and sporting a flawless minimal design, iPhone XR is a force with which to be reckoned. The 6.2-inch Liquid Retina screen is stunning, to say the least, while the nearly bezeless (all-screen) look means that it fits the bill in a modern smartphone lineup. Oh, and it also has a massively impressive battery offering up to 16 hours video playback. While it may be the most affordable modern iPhone, it still packs a punch.</p>

<h5>Huawei Mate 20 Pro</h5>
<p>Sticking with the minimal design theme here, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is a premium handset if ever we saw one. Perhaps one of its greatest features (and there are loads!) is the camera setup. The triple-threat camera with a remarkable wide lens on the rear is about as impressive as it gets. Plus, there&rsquo;s a 25-megapixel selfie cam too. The Mate 20 Pro also has some quirky features, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which do a whole lot when it comes to setting the device apart from the crowd.</p>

<h5>Samsung Galaxy S9</h5>
<p>While Samsung has stuck with the same design style we saw on the popular Galaxy S8, there&rsquo;s a load more going on under the hood here. Yes, the upgrades that have been made on the Galaxy S9 are all about the technology, rather than the look. And that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a seriously powerful phone. The device has a single-sensor 12-megapixel camera that takes excellent low-light pictures. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s a variety of photography features you&rsquo;re going to want to explore here too. It&rsquo;s one of Samsung&rsquo;s best devices, for sure.</p>
