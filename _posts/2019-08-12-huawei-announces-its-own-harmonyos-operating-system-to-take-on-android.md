<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Introducing&hellip; HarmonyOS!</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, the rumours are true. The officials at Huawei have announced that the company is developing a brand new operating system.</p>
<p>The system &ndash; named HongMeng in China &ndash; will be called HarmonyOS. Here&rsquo;s what we know about it so far.</p>
<h2>Sending out a Strong Message</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to the new operating system than meets the eye. The move comes in the wake of fraught relations between the Chinese brand and Android.</p>
<p>Back in May, Huawei&rsquo;s Android licence was temporarily suspended after the American government put the company on the trade blacklist. Eek.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, things are stable between the two companies. Huawei officials have not said that the phones will be making the switch. Woohoo!&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that the announcement of this new operating system sends out a strong message. If Huawei has no choice but to survive without the support of Android operating systems, it can (and will) do so.</p>

<h2>The OS Will Run on Smart Devices</h2>
<p>Instead, HarmonyOS will be used for some other Huawei smart devices including the brand&rsquo;s watches and speakers. Smart devices are increasingly popular, which could explain why the company&rsquo;s focus is on these devices right now.</p>
<p>Huawei&rsquo;s Richard Yu spoke at the Huawei Developer Conference in Dongguan, China, about the brand&rsquo;s plans for the future. He said that the operating system would allow developers more flexibility when it comes to making apps for a range of devices.</p>
<p>Of course, only time will tell what that actually means in practice and how it will work.</p>
<h2>And, Perhaps Phones&hellip; in the Future!</h2>
<p>So, what about Huawei phones? Will they be getting the Harmony OS in the future?</p>
<p>While there has been a load of rumours going around, there&rsquo;s no official word yet.</p>
<p>The newly announced operating system could &ndash;&nbsp;potentially &ndash;&nbsp;be used on Huawei smartphones. However, that may present some minor issues for users.</p>
<p>For one thing, the modern-day phone user expects an endless range of snazzy apps. Developers would have to embrace the new operating system (and make apps for it!) if it were to compete with the likes of Android and iOS.</p>

<p>Since this is something that&rsquo;s out of Huawei&rsquo;s hands, there&rsquo;s no saying whether or not it would happen.</p>
<p>Despite this obstacle, we can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that Huawei will start using its own operating system on phones at some point.</p>
<p>The fact that the brand is investing in this type of software certainly says something. With that in mind, who knows what the future holds?</p>
