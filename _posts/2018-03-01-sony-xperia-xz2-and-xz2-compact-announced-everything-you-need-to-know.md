<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">New design, new features and great cameras.</span></p>
<p>Announced a little earlier than any of us could have expected, the Sony Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact have now been revealed.</p>
<p>As these are the company&rsquo;s flagship devices, we&rsquo;ve been expecting rather big things from them. Here&rsquo;s what we know so far.</p>

<p><em>Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact feature video:</em></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YmHUbzYg04" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Since Sony released the Xperia range, not much has changed. The design, in particular, has stayed much the same across many devices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so refreshing to see a little makeover in the form of the Xperia XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact. Packed with a larger display and some curved edges to boot, these two smartphones look far fitter for the modern age.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the Sony Xperia XZ2 comes sporting a Gorilla Glass 5 coating along with some 3D curved glass.</p>
<p>The Compact version of the phone is a little less glamourous with a hard-coated polycarbonate finish. It really does look like the standard device's little brother or sister&hellip; and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>But wait, what about the screens? Well, the XZ2 has an impressive 5.7-inch screen, which comes with an 18:9 HDR display. Again, the Compact phone has a little less to offer here, but still has a 5-inch Full HDR screen. Essentially, both the phones has the same screen technology, so you won't be compromising on quality, just size.</p>
<p>There are slightly different colour options when it comes to the two phones too. The Sony Xperia XZ2 will come in Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, and Petrol Blue, while the smaller phone will be available in Black, White Silver, Moss Green and Coral Pink.</p>

<h2>Specs and Features</h2>
<p>The Sony Xperia XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact feature the likes of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, which should please many fans out there. Aside from that, they both have a standard 4GB of RAM. Both phones have plenty of space too with 64GB of storage.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of other flagship devices, Sony has popped the fingerprint sensor on the back of the device. The sensor sits just below the camera lens and should be easy enough to use. The XZ2 can also recognise the &lsquo;Okay, Google&rsquo; command, even when the screen is off.</p>
<p>The Xperia XZ2 alone will have the dynamic vibration system. This is another interesting feature, although it&rsquo;s not entirely clear how useful it will actually be. The XZ2 will vibrate when you&rsquo;re playing games on the device or watching videos.</p>
<p>Some reviewers have already likened this vibration feature to DUALSHOCK (PlayStation's controller - <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/heres-how-to-play-your-ps4-on-your-smartphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see how to play your PS4 on your Sony phone</a>) and it&rsquo;s plain to see that it&rsquo;s going to be very similar. Xperia Xz2 will also have a cool wireless charging feature.</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>Both of the new flagship devices boast the same cameras here, which may be a relief for those on a budget. Sony has claimed a &ldquo;world&rsquo;s first&rdquo; with the 19-megapixel rear-facing camera. According to reports, the snazzy cam is capable of recording 4K HDR.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Super slow motion feature, which is where the Sony Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact really up the game. It&rsquo;s touted to be the best on the market right now.</p>
<p>The front selfie camera has an acceptable 5-megapixel to play with. Perhaps the Sony developers could have improved this, but it clearly wasn&rsquo;t their main focus unlike the main camera.</p>

<h2>Release Date and Price</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a bit of a mystery! There&rsquo;s no word just yet on how much the device will cost so we don&rsquo;t have all that much to go on.</p>
<p>These phones&rsquo; predecessors came in at &pound;599 and &pound;499, which means that the latest devices may be in the same ballpark. With both devices now announced, you can register your interest with us here, Sony Xperia XZ2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, all we know right now is that both devices will be available to pre-order from 23rd March this year!</p>
