<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is this the cutest bit of tech you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</span></p>
<p>If you fancy yourself as an Apple geek, here&rsquo;s a something that will simply melt your heart. Over the years, you may have watched the transformation of Apple products - from rather large, bulky electronics, to the super-sleek gadgets we know and love today. It&rsquo;s been quite a journey.</p>
<p>Still, imagine you could relive some of that glorious 1980s nostalgia, while retaining all the fun features that the latest gadgets offer? It would basically be the dream.</p>
<p>Well, if you happen to have an Apple Watch, that dream might just be a reality. As you probably know, there are loads and loads of stands for your watch that you can buy. The price of these tiny products ranges so very dramatically that you may not know where to start at all. If you just can&rsquo;t get enough of all things Apple, though, we might have just the product for you.</p>
<p>Say hello to the Elago W3 Stand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12959" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/elago-w3-stand.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>The name of the Elago W3 Stand may not inspire all that much awe. It <em>does</em> sound very techy, which is likely to put a load of people off before they&rsquo;ve even seen it. When you cast your eyes on the stand, though, I&rsquo;m certain you will change your mind. You see, the tiny little Apple Watch stand looks exactly like an original 1984 Macintosh desktop computer. Awesome, right?</p>

<p>Sadly, this stand doesn't come with a miniature mouse or keyboard. But who cares when your Apple Watch stand looks this retro!&nbsp;And, guess what, it serves as a charger too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple set-up. Slide your Apple Watch into the silicone stand and it will start powering up, thanks to the built-in charging cable. We recommend removing your Apple Watch strap to make the Elago W3 Stand to appear even more like a miniature but oh-so legit Macintosh.</p>

<p>If you want to take things to the very next level, you should know that this retro gadget supports the Apple nightstand mode. That means that you can use the watch as an alarm clock which takes the form of a retro desktop. So many levels of geekiness right there!</p>
<p>You might think that a niche product like this one would set you back a small fortune. After all, it&rsquo;s a cool design that&rsquo;s sure to pique every Apple fan&rsquo;s interest. Well, you may be surprised to learn that Elago sells this little beauty for just &pound;20 via Amazon UK. It&rsquo;s available for both the Apple Watch Series 1 and 2.</p>
