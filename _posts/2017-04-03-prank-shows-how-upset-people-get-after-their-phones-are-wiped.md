<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Hilarious prank or just plain mean? Watch and decide.</span></p>
<p>If someone took your phone and, in an instant, wiped all your data, what would you do?</p>
<p>While we may not like to admit it, most of us would freak out. I know I would. That little device in the palm of my hand holds everything from my photos, to my music, to my calendar and emails. It&rsquo;s pretty darn essential, actually.</p>
<p>Well, recently the good people (or <em>bad</em> people - you decide) at Kodak played a prank on some unsuspecting UK civilians.</p>
<p>Pretending to be showing off a super-fast phone charger, a Kodak representative asked people in the street whether they could borrow their phone for just a quick moment.</p>
<p>Apparently, there were a load of people willing to hand over their smartphones, in the hopes of being wooed by this new, fancy technology&hellip;</p>

<p>There was just one tiny catch. The moment people handed over their phones, a seamless sleight of hand switched it with an identical, yet blank device. We don&rsquo;t know <em>how </em>the Kodak trickster managed conceal so many fake smartphones up his sleeves, but we do know that it looked as though each person&rsquo;s phone was completely void of its memory in just seconds. Yikes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more entertaining than trying to figure out how this prank worked is the reaction from each victim. Watching all their beloved photos disappear forever, many of them were absolutely beside themselves with horror. All those selfies, all those family pictures, and blurry bar snaps; gone forever. You can completely understand their despair.</p>
<p>Just look at the pain behind this guy's eyes.</p>

<p>The jokers at Kodak didn&rsquo;t just do this to mess with people. That would be rather cruel, although seriously entertaining. There was a hidden message behind Kodak&rsquo;s video, and that&rsquo;s that 1 in 3 people have lost photos on their phone in the past. So, rather than saving all your pictures on just one device, you should print them using&hellip; *drum roll*&hellip; Kodak stores. Genius.</p>
