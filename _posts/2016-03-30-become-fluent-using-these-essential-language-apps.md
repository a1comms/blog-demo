<p>At some point in their lives, everyone has fantasised about speaking a second language fluently. Historically, that fantasy has sadly remained just that for many people, unless they&rsquo;ve committed to a language class to learn the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to advancing technology, specifically mobile phone technology, many of us now have access to anything we want, whenever we want it. Including language learning resources.</p>
<p>So the dreamers who fantasise about mastering a new language, but could never find the time, money or feasibility to take on a teaching class, can do it the easier way and download a <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/apps/the-top-ten-free-android-apps">free app</a> to start grappling with the basics of a new language.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a multitude of available language apps on the market, but below I&rsquo;ve listed a sample of the ones I&rsquo;ve trialled and enjoyed the most.</p>
<h2>Google Translate</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really an application for practicing language skills, as such. What it is, is a basic translator tool that&rsquo;s great for individual words and simple sentences.</p>
<p>When it comes to expressions and idioms, Google Translate will interpret the sentence literally, word for word, rather than providing the equivalent turn of phrase.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9998" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Google-Translate.jpg" alt="Google Translate - Become fluent using these essential language apps" width="600" height="521" /></p>
<p>For example, in English, there&rsquo;s a very common expression that goes, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens before they hatch.&rdquo; The French counterpart goes, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell the bear skin before you kill the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you can see, if Google translated either expression into the other language, it might be accurate, but the meaning behind the expression would be lost and confusing.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8" target="_blank">Download Google Translate for iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download Google Translate for Android</a>.</p>
<h2>Busuu</h2>
<p>More suited to quick learners, Busuu tends to work through exercises at a speedy rate, rather than trying to embed information by repetition.</p>
<p>Tailored for learning up to 11 different languages, including Spanish, German and French, Busuu features vocabulary and grammar lessons, audio dialogues and interactive tests. You&rsquo;ll learn how to spell words, select the correct translations and match written answers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9997" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Busuu.jpg" alt="Busuu - Become fluent using these essential language apps" width="600" height="519" /></p>
<p>Busuu also gives you a platform to submit your exercises and have native speakers give you feedback. It&rsquo;s an excellent set up that&rsquo;s bound to improve your grasp.</p>
<p>Since Busuu functions perfectly offline, you won&rsquo;t need an internet connection to practice!</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/busuu-learn-to-speak-spanish/id379968583?mt=8" target="_blank">Download Busuu for iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.busuu.android.enc&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download Busuu for Android</a>.</p>
<h2>Memrise</h2>
<p>Like Busuu, Memrise also focuses on the power of native speakers, with thousands of videos recorded by users to help you on your way.</p>
<p>An aspect I find particularly helpful, is the apps ability to reinforce new words. When you progress up the levels, Memrise brings with it previously learnt vocabulary to ensure you don&rsquo;t forget anything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9996" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Memrise.jpg" alt="Memrise - Become fluent using these essential language apps" width="600" height="528" /></p>
<p>Memrise also features multiple game modes to stimulate different aspects of your memory, encompassing a wide range of learning styles that include review and strengthen, rapid recall and visual learning.</p>
<p>The app claims it can boost your brain to learn 44 new words every hour&hellip; You better get started!</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/memrise-learn-languages-free/id635966718?mt=8" target="_blank">Download Memrise for iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download Memrise for Android</a>.</p>
<h2>Duolingo</h2>
<p>And finally, my personal favourite: Duolingo.</p>
<p>Not only is it completely free of charge, it&rsquo;s surprisingly fun to use with a diverse selection of exercises to work through, to improve your vocabulary, orthography and pronunciation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9995" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/Duolingo.jpg" alt="Duolingo - Become fluent using these essential language apps" width="600" height="517" /></p>
<p>The exercises are generally pretty quick, and are easy to navigate on your mobile or tablet. Anyone of any age should be able to pick up a device and start learning with Duolingo.</p>
<p>Reminders, set to your daily goals, will ensure you come back to the app to keep practicing, and the reward system will no doubt keep you keen too.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8" target="_blank">Download Duolingo for iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Download Duolingo for Android</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKnKj23-jLAhWC1xoKHdkqDWcQFgg-MAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fduolingo-learn-languages-for-free%2F9wzdncrcv5xn&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNJ5M7g-ZqFmPqjmvMHXfIO2zulA&amp;sig2=ZjoWCLQ_TsUhPuAnqCJFQw" target="_blank">Download Duolingo for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;re plenty of applications on the market to choose from, all you need is to try a few and find the one that is right for you.</p>
<p>After mastering the basics, I would recommend visiting the country whose language you&rsquo;re learning, to pick up a feel of local accents which will likely be different to the ones you hear as you practice. Though, these days, you might find and exchange group online to converse with native speakers.</p>
