<p>The Cure, The Killers, Stormzy&hellip; This year&rsquo;s Glastonbury is all set to be one of the most unforgettable festivals of our generation.</p>
<p>If the lineup gives you flutters in your stomach and you&rsquo;ve got your ticket at the ready, there&rsquo;s one thing you should know.</p>
<p>Not only is the event going to host some of the greatest artists ever, it&rsquo;s also going to be uber connected.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the UK&rsquo;s first 5G-connected fest.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20881" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2019/06/glasto-ee-festival.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<h2>The First 5G-Connected Festival</h2>
<p>5G is the latest generation of mobile internet offering super-fast download and upload speeds, less latency and a smoother experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it &ndash;&nbsp;the service is leading the way when it comes to how we use our modern smartphones.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already bagged one of the top-of-the-range 5G mobile phones, we&rsquo;ve got news for you.</p>
<p>Luckily, EE customers can use their snazzy new device (and its ultra fast connectivity) in the rockin&rsquo; fields of Glastonbury.</p>
<p>This year, the festival is smashing new records to bring you the quickest internet speeds.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: EE is the festival&rsquo;s official technology partner for the sixth year in a row.</p>
<p>Plus, for the first time in the festival&rsquo;s history, the network will be putting up five temporary masts, which will be broadcasting 2G, 3G, 4G and new 5G.</p>
<p>So, whatever generation of internet you happen to be using, your phone will be able to connect quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>Sharing Is Caring (With 5G-Powered WiFi)</h2>
<p>While you&rsquo;re in the midst of Glasto &lsquo;19, you might want to spare a thought for your less-than-lucky friends who will be missing out on the weekend&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So, why not send them a quick peek of the action? Sharing pictures, videos, and more with your pals won&rsquo;t drain your data allowance while you&rsquo;re at this year&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>Picture the scene. You snap a picture of Stormzy's (sure to be) epic set and share it on your Insta story in seconds. Boom. Done.</p>
<p>Yes, festival-goers will have the chance to access 5G-powered WiFi all weekend long. What&rsquo;s more, they won&rsquo;t need to have a 5G compatible mobile to use this service.</p>
<p>That means that everyone can experience the true speed of the next gen mobile internet, regardless of what device they happen to have.</p>

<h2>More Power to Festival-Goers</h2>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t end there. EE will also be making sure that festival-goers are powered up at all times.</p>
<p>Since there&rsquo;s nothing worse than your battery dying in the middle of &lsquo;Friday I&rsquo;m in Love&rsquo; (can you imagine?!), this year&rsquo;s tech partner has the answer.</p>
<p>The EE Recharge Tent will be on site during the fest, allowing everyone to juice up their devices for FREE!</p>
