<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Tinder Select is what the rich and famous are using to date, apparently.</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an avid swipe-righter, there&rsquo;s one thing you may have wondered: why on earth have you never spotted Jennifer Lawrence on Tinder?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the type of question that will keep you awake until the wee hours of the morning, am I right? Your radius is set to maximum, you spend enough time flicking through the options, and according to The Mirror, <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/after-britney-spears-joins-tinder-4195598" target="_blank">some celebs are indeed on Tinder</a>. Yet no celeb matches. What gives?</p>
<p>Wonder no more, friends. There&rsquo;s probably a very good reason that no beautiful celebrities are popping up on your Tinder app. According to an unnamed source, there&rsquo;s a secret version of Tinder us regular chumps knew nothing about. The alternate account, called Select, is supposedly Tinder&rsquo;s VIP section, where top models can rub shoulders with CEOs and the like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13484" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3SYPfkUPt8WLD26Q00pc1lm_6ua0uPHIsV8MKuFhlNQAt0f9uQY61DIKgqA4CXsK-Uksx6vK_UBydlyIXc_sm-jW=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Apparently, Tinder Select isn&rsquo;t even a different app. Oh no, it&rsquo;s part of the regular one, just hidden behind a protective layer that most of us can&rsquo;t access. Once someone has been confirmed as a Select Member, they can choose to switch the exclusive layer on, and slip secretly into the VIP section you&rsquo;re not invited to.</p>
<h2>How Can I Get Invited to Tinder Select?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve just read all of the above, and are now thinking, &ldquo;Wow! I want in!&rdquo;, hold your horses right there. You should know that becoming a Select Member is not as easy as you might have hoped. In fact, it sounds ridiculously difficult and mysterious.</p>
<p>One way you can apparently become a member is if Tinder &lsquo;invites&rsquo; you to become one. That means that the powers at Tinder HQ think that you&rsquo;re important, rich, or famous enough to be one of their elite.</p>
<p>Failing that, another Select Member can invite you to be part of the crew. Presumably, Tinder officials still have to agree that you fit the bill.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13483" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iN5tb5WySM-C1O3AJxAmhJJ_fikFE5c8Y2myk9SHt0EeZE87lHO56VeD-cavP079SQui5W6top7waeCZOZZltWNt=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But what, exactly, are the criteria that Tinder is looking for? Unsurprisingly, no one really knows, though many have speculated that it&rsquo;s about being super-hot, wealthy, and influential (like other elite dating sites such as <a href="https://www.theinnercircle.co" target="_blank">The Inner Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.beautifulpeople.com/en-UK" target="_blank">Beautiful People</a>).</p>
<p>Another theory is that your <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054871/whats-your-tinder-score-inside-the-apps-internal-ranking-system" target="_blank">Tinder Elo score</a>, which says how popular you are on the app, has a bearing on acceptance too. Of course, Tinder is keeping its lips very tightly sealed when it comes to this, not yet confirming that Select exists.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question: no one knows exactly how to get you on the inside. And if you&rsquo;re having to ask, you&rsquo;re probably not going to receive the invite&hellip; Sorry, not sorry.</p>
