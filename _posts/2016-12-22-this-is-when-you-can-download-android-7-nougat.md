<p>Everyone's been making a lot of buss around Google's latest mobile OS - Android 7 Nougat - but how much do you really know about it?</p>
<p>What you may not realise is that Android 7 is actually out already on millions of smartphones. But your phone may not be ready for it yet&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/android-nougat-the-latest-and-tastiest-from-google">Android 7 Nougat features</a></p>
<p>That's because Nougat is being rolled out for different devices at different times. The question is: when will it be ready on <em>your</em> Android phone?</p>
<p>We've found out the latest information on the Android 7 release date for all the top handsets, from the biggest brands like: Samsung, Sony, LG and more. You can find out more about when your smartphone is due to get Nougat below.</p>
<h2>Google Devices Release Date</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xn9iq3lG_w" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you have either the new Google Pixel or the Google Pixel XL, you&rsquo;ll notice that Nougat is already preloaded onto your device. If you don&rsquo;t have either of those phones, don&rsquo;t panic. The update is now available to download on the Nexus Player, as well as following Google devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nexus 6P</li>
<li>Nexus 5X</li>
<li>Nexus 6</li>
<li>Nexus 9</li>
<li>Google Pixel C</li>
</ul>
<p>Google have imposed a two-year cut off for this upgrade. In short, that means that if your device is older than two years, you can't download Android Nougat. So if you own a Nexus 5, you will, sadly, have to do without.</p>
<h2>What About Other Android Mobiles?</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all very well and good if you happen to have a Google phone or tablet, but not everyone does. If you have an HTC, Samsung, LG, or other Android device, you may find that the update takes a little longer to reach your device. The fact of the matter is that the phone makers have to tweak the OS to suit their devices.</p>
<h2>Android Nougat for Samsung Release Date</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12739" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/N-OS-Beta-Program_Main_1.jpg" width="600" height="383" /></p>
<p>Samsung users can already get a taste of Android Nougat prior to the official release date. It may surprise you to hear that both Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge have access to a Nougat beta version. To use it, though, customers need to download the Galaxy Beta Program app and create a Samsung account. Oh, and your phone has to be unlocked.</p>
<h2>Android Nougat for Sony Release Date</h2>
<p>Both the Sony Xperia X and Xperia X Compact have got Android Nougat abroad in countries including Russia and Australia. With that in mind, it would make sense that the UK update will be following shortly. It has already begun rolling out for Sony Xperia XZ.</p>
<p>Sony Xperia Z3 will eventually receive a developer version of the software, but will not be getting the full upgrade at all. Here&rsquo;s a full list of the Sony phones that will be getting the update at some point in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xperia Z3+</li>
<li>Xperia Z4 Tablet</li>
<li>Xperia Z5</li>
<li>Xperia Z5 Compact</li>
<li>Xperia Z5 Premium</li>
<li>Xperia X</li>
<li>Xperia XA</li>
<li>Xperia XA Ultra</li>
</ul>
<h2>Android Nougat for HTC Release Date</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12740" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/htc-10-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Lucky for our friends across the pond, HTC has already begun rolling Android 7 out to unlocked HTC 10 and HTC One M9 units. As for us unworthy Europeans, HTC has confirmed it will bring Google's latest software to the HTC 10, One A9 and One M9 by the end of December. There's not long left, so HTC better get into gear!</p>
<p>If you're the unlucky owner of an HTC One M8, you won't be getting Android Nougat for Christmas this year, or the next we're afraid. You'll have to upgrade to a newer phone.</p>
<h2>Android Nougat for Moto Release Date</h2>
<p>The good news is that Android Nougat is already available for the Moto Z and Moto Z Force. What&rsquo;s more, the mid-range or budget Moto phones (such as the Moto G4, Moto G4 Play and Moto G4 Plus) will all be getting the update soon as well, although no official Android Nougat release date has been set right now.</p>
<h2>Android Nougat for LG Release Date</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12741" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/LG_G5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="472" /></p>
<p>Last year, LG updated its flagship mobile phones with the latest version of Android within a quick two months of Nexus. That's very quick in the Android game. To date, LG hasn't provided much in the way of information around seeding Android 7 out to devices, but we believe that devices like the LG G5 will receive it within a similar timeframe.</p>
<h2>Android Huawei for Moto Release Date</h2>
<p>The flagship Huawei Mate 9 is currently the only model run Android 7. Both Huawei Mate 8 and Huawei P9 are scheduled to have their software updated by March 2017 as well. These are the other Huawei devices that will be updated later on in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huawei P9 Plus</li>
<li>P9 Lite</li>
<li>Huawei Nova</li>
<li>Huawei Nova Plus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Android 7 Nougat Features</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12738" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/12/android-nougat-7.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>Now that you have at least a vague idea of when your particular device will have the update, let&rsquo;s talk for a minute about what Android Nougat will include.</p>
<p>One of the thing that many users are excited about is the multi-window feature. Yep, at last, you will be able to run two apps at the same time and use both of them on just the one screen. The update also includes Doze Mode 2.0, which is essentially a deep sleep mode for your phone. When you don&rsquo;t use the device for a while, it will drop into this mode which is certain to save a whole load of your battery life. Winning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not all! There will also be a new quick settings menu, bundled notifications, and a faster performance than previous updates. What this all means is that once you get Android Nougat on your device, you should be able to do a whole lot more with your phone than ever before. It might even be worth the wait after all. Watch this space!</p>
