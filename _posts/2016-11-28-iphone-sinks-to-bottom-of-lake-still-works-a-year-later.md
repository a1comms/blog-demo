<p>We&rsquo;re not sure what it is about iPhones that drive people to destroy them in such devastatingly creative ways. From dropping them off the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/iphone-7-drop-test-from-the-worlds-tallest-building">world&rsquo;s tallest building</a> to using one as <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/watch-will-this-giant-gummy-bear-shield-your-iphone-from-an-arrow" target="_blank">target practice</a>, tech junkies are always coming up with new ways to torture and ruin these devices.</p>
<p>Sadly, as we&rsquo;ve seen in the past, it&rsquo;s rare that iPhones manage to survive these feats (except the case involving <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/watch-what-happens-when-an-iphone-7-drowns-in-liquid-rubber" target="_blank">liquid rubber</a>). That&rsquo;s why we decided not to bring you the same old Apple sob story. Instead, we&rsquo;ve got an uplifting tale of stamina and survival that restore your faith in technology.</p>
<p>This story starts back in the dark ages, otherwise known as 2015, when one Michael Guntrum was on an ice fishing trip. Of course, he&rsquo;d taken along the essentials: his fishing gear, some warm threads and, of course, his trusty iPhone 4. All was going well, until the hands of fate intervened.</p>

<p>Sometime into the trip, the worst thing that could&rsquo;ve happened, did in fact happen. Michael was holding his iPhone when it suddenly slipped from his cold hands and plunged helplessly into the Kyle Lake. Needless to say, it sank to the very bottom in just a few seconds.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmichael.guntrum.56%2Fposts%2F637259773086011&amp;width=500" width="600" height="194" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever accidentally dropped your phone into the loo, you&rsquo;ll know that heart-wrenching feeling of horror. Well, imagine your toilet&rsquo;s the size of a lake and you&rsquo;ll know how Guntrum felt.</p>
<p>It seemed that there was no hope for the phone. Short of diving to the bottom of an icy lake in search of it (which is probably not advisable), there was nothing Guntrum could do to get it back. So, he went home and left it be.</p>
<p>Presumably, over the course of the next year, he got on with his life while stoically mourning the loss of his beloved iPhone 4. I like to imagine him staring out of his window on rainy, overcast days, yearning just to see it one more time.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, life for Guntrum and his iPhone 4 wasn&rsquo;t over just yet. Kyle Lake was drained this year, which presented an opportunity for Guntrum, who set out on a mission to locate his lost love using a metal detector. As you&rsquo;ve guessed by now, he did of course find it, entrenched in the lake bed.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that there&rsquo;s no way an iPhone could lead a watery life at the bottom of a lake for a year and still switch on to tell the story. Well, you&rsquo;d be wrong. You see, Guntrum popped the phone in rice for a couple of days (to absorb any moisture) and, through quick thought and good luck, his iPhone 4 worked!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12469" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/11/JS114506997-frozen-iphone-2-xlarge_transWqpbAtgKJyHaMBh-yZTXbZIlGok6fihUFBLl2BCRaec.jpg" alt="js114506997-frozen-iphone-2-xlarge_transwqpbatgkjyhambh-yztxbzilgok6fihufbll2bcraec" width="313" height="500" /></p>
<p>It just goes to show that not all iPhones can be destroyed so easily. While we don&rsquo;t suggest submerging any device in water for the course of a year, or even a second, this remains an inspiring tale.</p>
