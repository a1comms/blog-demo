<h2>What is EE Home Broadband?</h2>
<p>Think that all broadband deals are the same? You need to think again. When you look into the various offers that are out there, you'll see that some give you more than others. If you&rsquo;re the type of person who uses the internet 24/7, having a broadband service with unlimited usage could be the way to go. Here&rsquo;s what EE has to offer.</p>
<h5>EE Home Broadband: Easy Setup</h5>
<p>One of the things that stops so many people from switching providers is the fear that it will be difficult. Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash;&nbsp;none of us have the time or patience to mess around with setting up a whole new system. Luckily, the EE Home Broadband service could not be simpler to get started. You simply need to connect up the Hub, switch it on, and go.</p>

<h2>How to Get the Deal</h2>
