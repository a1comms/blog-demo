<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Netflix, the heavyweight in video streaming, now has some growing competition to contend with. Enter NOW TV and Amazon Prime.</span></p>
<p>Friday nights in were once spent with a couple of rented movies from Blockbuster, a bag of enamel-hungry popcorn and a tub of overpriced H&auml;agen-Dazs.&nbsp;For me, the only thing that&rsquo;s changed, is my local Blockbuster is now my local Morrisons. And rather than physically renting movies, I stream them.</p>
<p>The inception of on-demand video streaming, from services like Netflix, means we don&rsquo;t have to drag ourselves around a rental store anymore, clad in our onesies and slippers, to watch the latest films and TV shows. They live right where we want them to &ndash; the TVs in our homes.</p>
<p>Like any good idea, though, a lot of enterprises are being attracted to it. For Netflix, this means the competition is heating up. For you and me, it&nbsp;creates a headache. Who do I pick? What&rsquo;s the difference? Is this better than that? Yardy yar...</p>
<p>The truth is, many of the top video streaming services are similar. But, as you&rsquo;ll find out, each has its unique features that will appeal to different people. After reading through this, you should be able to identify which one is for you. And, <em>spoiler alert</em>, it might not be Netflix.</p>
<h2>Netflix: the one that's watching its back</h2>
<p>Netflix is currently the most popular&nbsp;video stream platform out there, with over 70m users worldwide.&nbsp;But with more services beginning to establish themselves as worthy competition, should Netflix be watching its back?</p>
<p>It offers an eclectic selection of movies, TV shows (including Netflix originals like House of Cards) and documentaries. One criticism I&rsquo;ve heard is the choice of movies isn&rsquo;t all that great, with very few new releases or classic blockbusters.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8561" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Netflix-House-of-Cards.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Netflix-House-of-Cards.jpg alt=&rdquo;Netflix Original House of Cards&rdquo;>" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p>However, the assortment of available TV shows and movies for kids, as well as the option for a separate, restricted children&rsquo;s profile, is definitely a big bonus if you&rsquo;re entertaining little ones.</p>
<p>There are three levels of subscription - &pound;5.99, &pound;7.49 and &pound;8.99 a month. The two higher tiers open up HD and Ultra HD content, respectively, as well as an increase in the amount of screens you can stream to, from one, to two and four. All can be cancelled at any time.</p>
<p>A one-month trial means you&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to test-drive Netflix, before committing any money. But make sure you manually cancel your membership as your trial comes to a close (if you don't wish to continue), otherwise it&rsquo;ll auto-renew and start charging at one of the above prices.</p>
<h2>NOW TV: the&nbsp;one that's free for three months</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more flexibility, NOW TV will suit you more than Netflix's constraints. There are three types of passes available to subscribe to, each offering different types of content: Sky Movies, Entertainment and Sky Sports, with no premium for HD quality.</p>
<p>A NOW TV Sky Movies Pass provides access to over 1000 films and up to 30 new premiers every month &ndash; yes, that&rsquo;s a new movie every night. It costs &pound;9.99 a month and can be cancelled at any time, although if you choose a six-month subscription, you&rsquo;ll save 40%. You can start a free 14-day trial to&nbsp;see if it's for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re more interested in catching up on shows like Game of Thrones, then a NOW TV Entertainment Pass is the one. You get all the must-see TV (from 13 pay channels) and over 250 box sets... Just remember to eat and sleep in between binges. The Entertainment Pass is yours for just &pound;6.99 a month, or, like the Movies Pass, 40% off when you opt for a six-month subscription.</p>

<p>But, why pay at all, when you could bag yourself a cheeky three month NOW TV Entertainment Pass for free, with the purchase of a 4GEE WiFi or tablet plan on an EE Extra deal. Using your tablet and double-speed data EE SIM, you&rsquo;ll be able to stream your favourite shows and even enjoy them on-the-move.</p>
<p>Lastly, not forgetting the sport-lovers, NOW TV also lets you watch the biggest matches on your TV, using a Sky Sports Pass. For this, you can pay per day (&pound;6.99), week (&pound;10.99) or month (&pound;31.99). It&rsquo;s a little pricey, but it beats paying for a full sports subscription if you&rsquo;d rather pick and choose what you watch.</p>
<h2>Amazon Prime: the one with that guy Clarkson</h2>
<p>Since acquiring the services of a certain petrol-head, who we&rsquo;ve learnt is not to be deprived of his dinner, lest you incur a <em>fracas </em>of bruising proportions, Amazon Prime has brought itself into stronger contention with the competition.</p>
<p>Along with free next-day delivery and a limited music streaming platform, Amazon Prime opens the door to unlimited streaming of a wide range of movies and TV shows, including some Amazon originals like Ripper Street, and Jeremy Clarkson's forthcoming motor show, which reportedly cost in the region of &pound;160m to secure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8563" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Jeremy-Clarkson-on-Amazon-Prime.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/02/Jeremy-Clarkson-on-Amazon-Prime.jpg alt=&rdquo;Jeremy Clarkson on Amazon Prime&rdquo;>" width="600" height="257" /></p>
<p>Similar&nbsp;to&nbsp;Neflix, flicking through the selection of content can be a little underwhelming at times, however the sheer volume of choice means that you&rsquo;re sure to find plenty worth watching. And, currently unique to Amazon, users can download videos on their iPhone, iPad or Android device for watching offline.</p>
<p>Of course, Amazon Student is a huge appeal for anyone still in education, as the normal Amazon Prime price of &pound;79 per year is reduced to a very reasonable &pound;35. Again, you don&rsquo;t have to dive right in, a 30-day free trial will give you all the time you need to assess whether Prime is worth the pennies.</p>
