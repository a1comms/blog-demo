<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Once you see it, you can't <em>un</em>see it. However much you try.</span></p>
<p>Is it just me, or do you ever experience that moment when you plug your phone in to charge, and just wish the cable looked a lot less like a cable, and a lot more like an umbilical cord?</p>
<p>No? Well apparently a Japanese &lsquo;artist&rsquo; did, after creating what can only be described as the most repugnant monstrosity the mobile industry has ever seen; somehow out-fugly-ing even the Nokia 7280.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_10671" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-10671" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/06/Nokia-7280.jpg" alt="Nokia 7280" width="600" height="375" /> Nokia 7820 &ndash; worst mobile phone ever?[/caption]</p>
<p>The video below reveals just how terrifying this umbilical phone charger is, as you watch it slowly pulsate, seemingly digest a poor and defenceless iPhone, complete with realistic, yet oh so very unsettling, slurping effects.</p>
<p><strong>Content Warning: this phone charger is the very stuff your worst nightmares are made of.</strong></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already broken into a cold, tremoring sweat, then wait until you hear how much this abomination costs&hellip;</p>
<p>Available to purchase on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/jp/listing/123441193/grow-cable?ref=shop_home_active_1" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, this &lsquo;Grow Cable&rsquo; will set you back a horrifying &pound;4,689.77. And that&rsquo;s without taking into account the cost of the ensuing therapy sessions you will so desperately need.</p>
<p>The seller describes their umbilical charger as followed, &ldquo;The iPhone cable shaped as an umbilical cord, which keeps moving while it&rsquo;s charging&hellip; I designed the looking of this cable as an umbilical cord, which mother feeds energy to her baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this mobile phone accessory isn&rsquo;t nearly as pointless as <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/jack-pen-is-this-the-most-pointless-mobile-accessory-ever" target="_blank">Jack Pen</a>, which we so kindly reviewed earlier in the year, but it does reach levels of terror no one knew were possible for a phone charger.</p>
