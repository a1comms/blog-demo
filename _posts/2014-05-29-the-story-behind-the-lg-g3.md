<div id="stcpDiv"><span class="postStandFirst">LG has spoken out on the design choices made during the development of the LG G3, and they help to explain why the phone is the way it is. Going by the mantra of &ldquo;we want to beat Samsung&rdquo;, LG set about crafting a phone that would stand out, with its laser-assisted autofocus camera and its magnificent Quad-HD screen surpassing anything else on the market. Whether it will be enough to beat the Samsung Galaxy S5 remains to be seen, but thanks to the choices LG made, it certainly has the prowess to attempt it!</span></div>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4308" alt="14103666858_3eec717bdf" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/06/14103666858_3eec717bdf.jpg" width="490" height="500" />The LG G3 has now been officially unveiled, and it&rsquo;s become readily apparent that LG has made some intriguing design decisions while coming up with their latest superphone. It would be rather interesting to find out <em>why</em> the designers made those decisions.</div>
<div>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Thanks to an article on Engadget, we now have a lot more insight into LG&rsquo;s design philosophy, and the thought process that led to one of the most powerful and unique smartphones the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>It turns out that the overriding principle behind the LG G3 was actually remarkably simple, and can be summed up in five words: LG wants to beat Samsung. That&rsquo;s an understandable goal, as one of the reasons that the LG G2 perhaps didn&rsquo;t perform as well as expected in the market is because it was going up against the Samsung Galaxy S4. That was in 2013, though, and in 2014, LG are facing an even bigger barrier to mass-market mega-success, in the shape of the wildly popular Samsung Galaxy S5 (not to mention the water-resistant Sony Xperia Z2, and the HTC One M8 with its unique, depth-sensing Duo Camera).</p>
<p>Clearly, then, LG couldn&rsquo;t afford to go with half-measures on the LG G3; they couldn&rsquo;t just make a phone that matched rival phones, but one that offered something unique by, in certain key areas, <em>surpassing</em> them. What&rsquo;s surprising is that one of those key areas was helped to become unique by, of all things, <em>vacuum cleaners</em>.</p>
<p>Or rather, to put it more accurately, self-propelled robot vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>The people behind those robot vacuums were testing out infra-red lasers, to let the devices figure out how far away they were from walls, furniture or pets, and those infra-red lasers (while not being much use in the vacuums themselves, as it turned out), have found a home in the LG G3&rsquo;s camera, where they help the autofocus to work a lot faster, giving it an edge over rivals.</p>
<p>The other obvious selling point is the screen, as it&rsquo;s the first smartphone from a major manufacturer to use a Quad-HD screen, making it sharper than <em>any</em> other phone on the market! Brilliantly, LG also says this new screen resolution does not come at the expense of battery life, thanks to software trickery that keeps the screen&rsquo;s refresh rate down when it&rsquo;s not being interacted with, thus increasing the standby time form the 3000mAh battery.</p>
<p>The article also goes into detail about the physical design of the phone, and answers the question of why it has a faux-metal shell, instead of an <em>actual</em> metal shell. Put simply, LG wanted a phone that didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; feel to it, and since metal shells can hurt the phone&rsquo;s signal (as happened with the old iPhone 4) while also heating up an awful lot during wireless charging (which the LG G3 supports), the best option was to go for a premium-grade plastic housing.</p>
<p><strong>The results of the company&rsquo;s design decisions speak for themselves. The LG G3 is not only gorgeous, but it&rsquo;s enticingly powerful, and that screen is, quite frankly, <em>glorious</em>. Whether it will be enough to beat the mighty Samsung Galaxy S5 remains to be seen (and a head-to-head between these two phones is just <em>begging</em> to be done), but it feels like LG has a real chance of doing just that!</strong></p>
