<p><span class="postStandFirst">The Moto E has now been officially unveiled, and it does for sub-&pound;100 phones what the Moto G did for mid-range phones. With a snappy dual-core processor, a 4.3-inch screen, a microSD slot and (shockingly) a water-resistant coating, the Moto E might just be the best ultra-budget phone ever made!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4538 aligncenter" alt="Moto E" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/05/moto-e.jpg" width="442" height="500" /></p>
<p>When it comes to mid-range phones, the Moto G is the king of the castle, but what about <em>ultra-budget</em> smartphones, smart devices that come in <em>under</em> &pound;100? Well now, there&rsquo;s a new king in that category, as well...</p>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>As you may have been expecting, it&rsquo;s the Moto E, which has now been announced by Motorola.</p>
<p>The best thing about the Moto G is that it offers a list of features that are way beyond what one would have previously expected from a mid-range phone, with a 720p HD screen, and a surprisingly fast processor. In essence, the Moto G redefined what was possible from a mid-range phone.</p>
<p>And that is <em>precisely</em> what the Moto E does for sub-&pound;100 phones.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the specs aren&rsquo;t quite as good as the Moto G; what you&rsquo;re looking at here is dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor that&rsquo;s clocked to 1.2GHz, a 4.3-inch screen with a resolution of 960x540 pixels, and a 5MP camera. However, the Moto E does also come with 1GB of RAM, so while it&rsquo;s never going to worry the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5, the performance will be surprisingly good for such a cheap phone.</p>
<p>It also includes a microSD slot (a feature that has been making a comeback in recent times, even appearing in the HTC One M8), but there&rsquo;s one feature that stands out above all others.</p>
<p>Yes, the Moto E is also, in a move that <em>none</em> of us saw coming, water-resistant. It might not be <em>quite</em> as water-resistant as the Sony Xperia Z2, because it just has a water-resistant <em>coating</em>, but it&rsquo;s utterly <em>brilliant</em> to see that feature appearing on a sub-&pound;100 phone!</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no release date for the Moto E as yet, but if you&rsquo;re searching for a smartphone under &pound;100, then stay tuned for more news, because you do <em>not</em> want to miss this one!</strong></p>
