<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Ever since the birth of the smartphone, one of the most popular experiences&nbsp;has been listening to music. In today's modern, on-demand orientated world, new and improved ways of listening to your favourite tunes have emerged, in the form of&nbsp;streaming services. But which do you choose? We look at three of the best, in a Music Apps Head-to-Head.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Apple Music - <span style="color: #de007d;">&pound;9.99 a month</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8260" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/apple-music.png" alt="Apple Music" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>First up, we have Apple&rsquo;s offering, simply called Apple Music. Priced at &pound;9.99 per month (and with a three month free trial), Apple Music offers a huge selection of songs and artists to choose from, as well as the Beats 1 online radio station, and the Connect blogging platform, allowing artists to connect with their fans directly through the service.</p>
<p>You can even get a family plan for &pound;14.99 per month, so your whole family can stream music through the service without having to buy their own subscription!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Google Play Music - <span style="color: #de007d;">&pound;9.99 a month</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8265" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/google-play-music.png" alt="Google Play Music" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Google Play Music takes a different approach, as it has two tiers of service. First of all, there&rsquo;s the free version; anyone with a standard Google account can upload and store up to 50,000 songs online, at no extra cost, and stream those songs through a dedicated player.</p>
<p>The streaming part of the service is covered by the All-Access service, charged at &pound;9.99 per month (with a 30-day free trial), which lets you stream any of the 35 million songs in the Google Play catalogue, ad-free.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Spotify - <span style="color: #de007d;">&pound;9.99 a month</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8266" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/01/spotify.png" alt="Spotify Music Streaming" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Finally, we come to perhaps the most well-known name in the world of music streaming: Spotify. It&rsquo;s unique in that it offers a streaming service for free (Google Play Music doesn&rsquo;t offer streaming without the All-Access pass), as well as it&rsquo;s premium service for &pound;9.99 per month.</p>
<p>Combined with a huge catalogue of music (and special deals, for students as an example), it&rsquo;s easy to see why Spotify has gone on to become one of the most well-known and popular music platforms online.</p>

<p>Premium packages for all three of these services all come in at the same price, so the choice is yours, over which one best meets your needs. Audio quality is excellent across the board, and each service offers unique benefits (Google+ integration with Play Music, Beats 1 radio and family plans with Apple Music, and free streaming plus support for external hi-fi set-ups with Spotify). So, if you&rsquo;re a music fan, you&rsquo;re spoilt for choice!</p>
