<p><span class="postStandFirst">With super-fast quad-core processors, amazing 1080p displays and the ability to take images that rival full digital SLR cameras, have we reached the pinnacle of mobile technology?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/smartphones/htc-one/overview/HTC-ProductDetail-Overview-Container4-03-bg.png" width="536" height="384" /></p>
<p>Recently we have seen the release of several superphones from big manufacturers like Sony, with its waterproof Xperia Z; HTC and the stunningly beautiful One; and Samsung with the upcoming next generation Galaxy S4. These phones are amazing devices, each with beautiful eye-wateringly high-quality displays of 1080p resolution, quad-core processors packing PC-speed chipsets, and cameras capable of taking incredible photos and videos.</p>
<p>With all this up-to-the-minute technology packed inside our smartphones the question on our lips is.. Where does it all go from here? Well, as ever with our gadget-obsessed species, the answer is upwards.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years smartphone technology has been advancing at a rate of knots with each manufacturer competing for who has the highest resolution display, who&rsquo;s device is faster and which one can take the most pictures in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>One such technology in mobile devices which has already seen a huge improvement, and will certainly see further evolution, is battery life. The average smartphone today will just about last the day with standard useage, but new advances in Lithium-Ion could soon see us using smartphones that last weeks on a single charge. What's more, us impatient souls can also hope to see smartphones which have the ability to be charged lightning fast and completely wirelessly, so we have to wait even less time for our precious handsets to re-juice.</p>
<p>In their current incarnation, mobile handset displays are at their optimum with regards to resolution and pixel density. This is simply because the human eye cannot process a difference in pixels per inch beyond 300. However, changes in display technology are on the horizon with new visual developments including bendable screens,Corning's Photo-voltaic Glass and dual displays which incorporate LCD and e-ink technology.</p>
<p>Another side of mobile evolution is storage. Most devices come with a fairly healthy amount of built-in storage or, if not, at least the option to increase onboard storage via a memory card.&nbsp; But we are now seeing the genesis of better data networks and the ability to store information in the 'cloud', meaning we will need less and less space on our mobiles, perhaps only a small amount for buffering.</p>
<p>This year the battle for wearable tech will ensue as Google comes ever closer to releasing it's Google Glass phenomenon, an augmented reality-based product that works in conjunction with your Android smartphone or tablet. Elsewhere, we have heard rumours of an iWatch from Apple, a smart watch that works with your i device. With these types of technology comes the ability to control our devices differently, perhaps in a Microsoft Kinect-type way, thus bringing more versatility to our mobile worlds.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting mobile evolution&nbsp; is the ability to print your own device. With production of 3D printers now in overdrive it is not unreasonable to think that, one day, you may be able to order the specific design you want for your handset and have the company send out your printed device for easy self-assembly. In fact, Nokia has already released its design schematics to certain companies for customers to order 3D-printed covers for its own Lumia smartphone range.</p>
<p><strong>Wherever the future takes us one thing is certain... We are limited only by our own imaginations.</strong></p>
