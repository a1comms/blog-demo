<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Wizarding World needs you. Yes, you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not you ever got that letter from Hogwarts, it&rsquo;s time to step up and grab your trusty wand.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;calamity&rsquo; is coming and it&rsquo;s your job to do something about it &ndash;&nbsp;with a little help from AR, of course.</p>

<h2>Harry Potter Wizards Unite</h2>
<p>A brand-new game has just hit the app stores. Harry Potter Wizards Unite gives gamers the chance to live out their fantasy of casting spells, defeating the Dark Arts, and more.</p>
<p>The story of the game is straightforward and mystical enough. There is an unknown threat out there and wizards (i.e. players) have to complete certain tasks to stop it.</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, Pok&eacute;mon Go, this AR-based game combines reality with computer generated content.</p>
<p>It uses the camera of your phone to show you a slightly enhanced version of reality; one complete with magical elements such as beasts, wizards and landmarks. Plus, there&rsquo;s an in-app map that shows you where all these things are.</p>
<h2>How to Play the Game</h2>
<p>Before you do anything, you need to download the app to your smartphone. It&rsquo;s free but be aware that there are in-app purchases here.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve completed the download, you can open the app and get started right away.</p>
<p>First of all, you will need to create yourself a wizzardy profile, including a picture and your house (Hufflepuff for life!).</p>
<p>You can create a Ministry of Magic ID simply by taking a selfie and then customising it with fun extras, such as a wizard&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>Next, it&rsquo;s time to open up the map and see what magical elements are in your local area.</p>
<p>You should see a range of icons on the map and will need to walk to each location to see what the icon means. Plus, here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the various gaming elements.</p>

<h5>Inns and Greenhouses</h5>
<p>You can head to inns to get tasty (AR!) dishes. Each dish you get will give you extra energy to cast spells. Plus, you can head to greenhouses to get special ingredients, which you can use in spells later.</p>
<h5>Confundables</h5>
<p>These all-important icons look like badges. Your aim is to head to a confundable, cast a spell on it, and capture it. You can then add it to your in-game registry.</p>
<h5>Fortresses</h5>
<p>The fortresses offer a multiplayer element to the game. You will need to team up with four other players to take part in these battles. If you win, you can gain some powerful objects.</p>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Should you come across beasts or wizards during your travels, you may need to combat them. You will have to use spells and things in your registry to fight these critters.</p>
<h5>Landmark events</h5>
<p>These are major battles which play a part in the main game story. You should keep your eye out for when these events take place as they could make you super powerful.</p>
<h2>Grab Your Wand and Get Started!</h2>
