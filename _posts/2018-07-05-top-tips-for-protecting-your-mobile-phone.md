<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">To case or not to case? That is the question.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. You&rsquo;ve risked it for a biscuit and not put a case on your mobile phone, or even a screen protector for that matter&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on a night out trying to take a group selfie and your phone is sent flying across the dance floor.</p>
<p>You retrieve your phone, only to discover that it has a lovely cracked corner. Wonderful.</p>

<h2>1) &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Fine, I Never Drop My Phone&hellip;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Said all the people who break their phones.... Although many of us think this way, here&rsquo;s a few daily scenarios where it could all go wrong for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the loo > It slips out your hand and falls into oblivion!</li>
<li>Getting into or out of your car > It falls out your pocket onto concrete</li>
<li>Nights out > Your phone gets knocked out your hand, onto a wet and hard dance floor. Nice</li>
<li>Taking a bath > It could slip under the water like a submarine. Game over</li>
<li>Cooking at home > Your phone can easily get knocked from the work surface. Crash bang onto the tiles</li>
<li>Music festivals or packed crowds > Look out for pickpockets!</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just a few little scenarios where your phone's life could be in danger.</p>
<p>But what actually happens when you do drop your phone nowadays. How bad does it get? Well, if you're lucky enough (or careful enough) not to have ever done it, here are some videos to give you an idea.</p>
<p>Check out what a small drop could do to your iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>

<p>And, see how this Samsung Galaxy S9 faired being dropped from dizzy heights by a drone!</p>
