<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">We bet you didn&rsquo;t know these iPhone tricks.</span></p>
<p>There are few things that the iPhone can&rsquo;t do these days. Still, there are many little tips and tricks you may not have thought of. If you want to make the most of your phone, here are some things you may wish to try!</p>
<h2>1) Turn Your Wallpaper Trippy</h2>
<p>Sick and tired of looking at the same old wallpaper on your phone? Well, if you want to be <em>really </em>unique, this is the trick for you. Head to <a href="http://heyeased.weebly.com">heyeased.weebly.com</a> where you can download trippy, moving wallpapers for your phone. Your mates will be amazed when they see the back of your device wiggling and jiggling away.</p>
<h2>2) Add Folders to Your Dock</h2>
<p>You likely already know that you can pop an app in your &lsquo;Dock&rsquo; (the bottom strip of your screen) by dragging and dropping it, but did you know this? You can also &lsquo;Dock&rsquo; an entire folder in the same way! If you need easy access to more than four little apps, this is 100% the way forward for you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how easy this really is. Once you&rsquo;ve made your folder (by dragging and dropping apps together!), you just need to long-hold it and drag it down to the bottom of the screen. The folder will lock to the Dock meaning that you can access it whenever you need. Simple!</p>

<h2>3) Clear Out Old Apps</h2>
<p>First of all, we have a little bad news for you. Once you get iOS 11, you may find that some of your older, less up to date apps stop working. Eek! That&rsquo;s no fun. The last thing you want, though, is to keep a bunch of apps that are basically useless (and, quite literally, a real waste of space!). So, what should you do?</p>
<p>Head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>General </strong>> <strong>About </strong>and then hit the &lsquo;<strong>Applications</strong>&rsquo; button. There you should find a whole list of apps that will become redundant with the new update. Get rid of them now to save yourself time and storage in the future.</p>
<h2>4) Unlock Your Phone Like a Boss</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it &mdash; we&rsquo;re all busy people and some of us just don&rsquo;t have the time to press a button. It&rsquo;s a waste of our precious energy. So, if you want to make unlocking your phone easier than it is now, there&rsquo;s a simple trick that you can use.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>General </strong>> <strong>Accessibility </strong>> <strong>Home Button </strong>and then press &ldquo;<strong>Rest Finger to Open</strong>&rdquo;. When you&rsquo;ve done so, you will find that you can unlock your phone just by resting your finger lightly on the Home Button. Phew! Nothing could be easier.</p>

<h2>5) Text With Absolute Ease</h2>
<p>If you spend what feels like most of your waking hours typing out loads and loads of text, you need this next trick. Head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>General </strong>> <strong>Keyboards </strong>and then press <strong>Text Replacement</strong>. From there, you will be able to add some text shortcuts so that you can easily send people long messages without having to type them.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re forever writing out the phrase &ldquo;Cool, I will call you when I&rsquo;m almost there&rdquo;, you could set a shortcut to type that when you press &ldquo;C3&rdquo;. At first, using these codes may seem a little odd but the more you use them, the more natural it will become.</p>
