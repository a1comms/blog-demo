<p>This page is the <strong>quickest</strong> way to get the <strong>latest</strong> updates on your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that iPhone 7 is an amazing phone, and hugely popular as a result!</p>
<p>Because of this, UK availability of iPhone 7 has been limited since its launch, not quite meeting demand... That being said, we&rsquo;ve been working hard with our partners, EE and Three, to ensure a steady a flow of stock as possible!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a position where our iPhone 7 stock and availability levels are good across most&nbsp;colours, storage sizes and networks. If, despite this, you haven't received your iPhone 7 yet, it's likely your order is still in processing as we work through the backlog of orders; you'll be contacted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On iPhone 7 Plus, we're still facing stock challenges. As is the rest of the market, including Apple. We're receiving some deliveries, although not enough to fulfill all orders.</p>
<h2>Latest iPhone 7 Stock Levels &ndash; EE</h2>
<p>We have good supply of&nbsp;the majority of iPhone 7 models.</p>
<p>iPhone 7 Plus stock is in much shorter supply. We're receiving small, irregular deliveries. Apple's own website is currently stating anywhere between 2-3 weeks.</p>

<h2>Your Questions Answered</h2>
<p><strong>When will I know that my phone&rsquo;s in stock?</strong></p>
<p>Check this post daily for the latest and quickest iPhone 7 stock updates. But as soon as we ship your order for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">free delivery</span>, we&rsquo;ll send you an email and text confirmation to let you know it&rsquo;s on the way. We&rsquo;ll also send you a notification on the day it&rsquo;s due. For more information around deliveries, check <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/help/delivery">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why have I not received a confirmation email?</strong></p>
<p>We send all of our customers an order confirmation email, though these can sometimes get filtered into your junk or spam folder. Please ensure you check these folders and add <a href="mailto:no-reply@buymobiles.net">no-reply@buymobiles.net</a> to your contact list to ensure you get all of our communications.</p>
<p><strong>The phone lines are busy, what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>We apologise if you can&rsquo;t get through to us on the phone, or via email or social media. We&rsquo;ve been very busy recently, but&nbsp;we&rsquo;re trying our best to answer as many calls, emails and other contacts as quickly as we can. The best place for regular iPhone 7 stock updates is right here, in this post.</p>
<p><strong>Are phones sent out in order of being placed?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to prioritise orders on a first-come, first-served basis. If you&rsquo;ve got a place reserved on the list, we recommend keeping it in order to get your order as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Should I cancel and look elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>We would recommend you don&rsquo;t. Cancelling could further delay your wait, since we believe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> UK retailers are experiencing iPhone 7 stock constraints. By ordering with us, you&rsquo;ve reserved a place on the list and will be treated as a priority.</p>
<p><strong>I have sent in my ID for verification, when will I receive my phone?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to complete any ID verification checks within 24 hours of receipt. You&rsquo;ll be notified via email to confirm once this has been done (add <a href="mailto:no-reply@buymobiles.net">no-reply@buymobiles.net</a> to your contact list to ensure you get all of our communications). Subject to availability and acceptance by the network, we&rsquo;ll then ship your handset.</p>
<p><strong>Why has my order been paused?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that your order has been paused because the network would like to review your account, which can typically take up to around an hour.</p>
<p>As a separate reason, you might have placed an order for a new contract phone, when in fact you&rsquo;re eligible for an upgrade. If so, we need to know whether you&rsquo;re happy to take on a new line with a new number, or you&rsquo;d like to upgrade and keep your existing number.</p>
<p><strong>Why is my tracking reference number not working?</strong></p>
<p>Our courier, UK Mail, operates late into the night to ensure you get fast, free next-day delivery. That means that your phone may be registered quite late at night. So, we advise checking from 10:00PM onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Why has my order been declined?</strong></p>
<p>The networks can&rsquo;t share reasons for declining your application, so we can&rsquo;t shed any light on this unfortunately. However, should you wish to find out more, you can contact the network directly who may overturn its original decision. In such a case, you&rsquo;ll be provided an Agreement Number to get your order with us pushed through.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change my address on the order?</strong></p>
<p>Our free delivery service is available at your home address where your payment details are registered to. For more information around deliveries, check <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/help/delivery">here</a>.</p>
