<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">You spoke and we listened. After reading our comparison of video streaming services, you wanted to hear more about NOW TV, and here it is.</span></p>
<p>Brought to you by the entertainment giant Sky, NOW TV offers a trilogy of on-demand streaming services, categorised by movies, TV shows and sports.</p>
<p>Each is a stand-alone deal and can be bought as such. So rather than paying for &lsquo;the whole package&rsquo;, you only pay for the content you want to consume. It&rsquo;s video streaming at its most flexible.</p>
<p>The three types of NOW TV subscriptions are a Sky Movies Pass, an Entertainment Pass and a Sky Sports Pass. Let&rsquo;s talk more about what each one has to offer.</p>
<h2>NOW TV Sky Movies Pass</h2>
<p>A Sky Movies Pass is the film-fanatic's&nbsp;dream come true, with access to over 1,000 movies (new and old) and up to 30 new flicks added each month, keeping the content so fresh, you&rsquo;ve got a new blockbuster to enjoy every night. Current titles include Tomorrow Land&nbsp;and Ex Machina &ndash; both of which were top-drawer.</p>

<p>For a simple rolling subscription (that can be cancelled at any time), NOW TV Sky Movies will cost you &pound;9.99 a month. If you&rsquo;re happy to commit to a little longer, you can save up to 40% on the price, paying just &pound;35.99 for a six-month pass.</p>
<p>Making a financial commitment without trying the service wouldn&rsquo;t be ideal, would it? That&rsquo;s why NOW TV offers a free 14-day trial to anyone and everyone, you just need to cancel once it&rsquo;s up.</p>
<h2>NOW TV Entertainment Pass</h2>
<p>Breaking Bad over Superbad? The Walking Dead instead of Sean of the Dead? If your weakness is addictive TV shows like these then what you need is a NOW TV Entertainment Pass.</p>
<p>With one, you can watch 13 pay TV channels that aren&rsquo;t available on Freeview, and enjoy all the new shows and award-winning dramas. You can watch content live or catch-up, and work your way through a staggering 250 box sets at whatever pace you want to set.</p>

<p>Sounds great, right? You haven&rsquo;t heard the best bit yet. Usually, a NOW TV Entertainment Pass would cost you &pound;6.99 a month. However, for a limited time only, when you buy one of our <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/contract-tablets" target="_blank">tablets </a>or <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/mobile-broadband" target="_blank">mobile broadband</a> devices on an EE Extra tariff, you can claim a free three month pass, and binge on all the TV shows you want &ndash; straight from your new tablet.</p>
<h2>NOW TV Sky Sports Pass</h2>
<p>The trouble with buying a long-term sports package, is that the games you really want to watch are often few and far between, and a lot of the mid-week content is pretty unappealing. Is <em>anyone</em> really&nbsp;watching the Pro Kabaddi League on a Wednesday night?</p>
<p>What if you could access sport as&nbsp;and when you wanted it? A NOW TV Sky Sports Pass allows you to do just that, in the form of a &pound;6.99 Day Pass, a &pound;10.99 Week Pass and &pound;31.99 Month Pass. So when your team reaches the FA Cup Final, or you want to watch England take on the Aussies in the Ashes, one of the above passes will keep the sport you want rolling for as long as you need it.</p>
