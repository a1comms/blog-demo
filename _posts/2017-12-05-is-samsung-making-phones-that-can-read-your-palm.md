<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Throwing the future of smartphone security wide open, and putting psychic palm readers out of work. It can only be Samsung.</span></p>
<p>Smartphone security is something of an arms race these days. First, we had the simple passcode (ah, the good old days!). Then, the fingerprint scanner and iris scanner came along to make the former all but obsolete. Next, Apple came tumbling along with its facial recognition feature and changed the game once again.</p>
<p>Needless to say, security on smartphones is serious business and every manufacturer out there wants the most advanced feature for their devices. So, what does the future hold? It could be something&hellip; mystical.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15803" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LHgRslZPty95__ObUeiBzmSa0RgTXUP7spnproPX2pDVQPMFL2GpXxq4KJuyuHwSCKGbWL3b5rO4eF0oP6yTRcvF=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>It seems that the good people at Samsung think that palm reading could be the next big thing. Seriously. According to a recently published patent, that&rsquo;s exactly what they are working on at the moment.</p>
<p>The design shows a feature that would scan the lines on the palm of your hand to figure out whether you are the main device user. The idea is that once the device recognises your hand, it will give you hints as to what your passcode is.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15813" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gShLrQ-mAs5MXZy2kdYvCY0i-F8mw9mlKAiPtosgk0Ry_NC3buNYUvCH9dkPD3Xso3cUwYEq4mzUTf8D4VP1VSg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, in theory, should you forget your Samsung passcode, all you would need to do is open your palm towards the camera of your phone. The system would then check out your unique lines and decide whether you're the right person or not. It would then give you a few hints here and there to nudge you along the way and help you recall your passcode. (Of course, a pretty major part of this would have to be that the hints are vague.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15814" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t_5ku5YO1blBTZPyPB8dm8u8XWTESNdwUspkluLeIEGXYb2GxAEoKl_Xi_2MTtYRAC6X4NJVKGveMi8neoj6XZ_G=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>But wait a minute, what if someone has a picture of your palm? While there&rsquo;s no information in the patent about it, the likelihood is that Samsung would use depth-sensing technology to combat this problem.</p>
<p>It could work much like Apple&rsquo;s Face ID, the idea that the tech would only work with a real life hand to unlock the device. The camera would be able to detect depth and check that it is a 3D hand and not merely a 2D image. Phew.</p>
<p>So, will we be seeing this tech on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/samsung-galaxy-s9-rumours-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung&nbsp;Galaxy S9</a></span>? Well, the jury&rsquo;s still out on that one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that filing a patent is merely protocol. The guys at Samsung may just be testing the feature to see if there&rsquo;s anything in it. That means that we may never see this security system on future devices. Then again, it could happen. Stranger things have. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
