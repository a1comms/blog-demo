<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This is the droid you're looking for&hellip;</span></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably been counting down the days, and crossing off the dates on your calendar. Yes, as winter is very much upon us now, there&rsquo;s one big event looming. That&rsquo;s right &mdash; I&rsquo;m talking about 15th December, a.k.a. Star Wars: The Last Jedi day.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise, there&rsquo;s one gift you should stick on your Christmas list this year...</p>
<p>Try to contain yourselves, guys, because Sphero has just released a bad-ass, smartphone-controlled R2-D2 droid. That means you can have your very own franchise-themed robot under the tree this year. Meet R2-D2 and your other favourite droids in this video:</p>

<h2>Works with the Free Sphero Star WarsTM App</h2>
<p>As you may already know, R2-D2 wasn't the first Star Wars themed droid to hit the market. There&rsquo;s also a BB-8 from The Force Awakens available to buy.</p>
<p>These droid creations work with the Sphero Star WarsTM App, which is available for both Apple and Android, meaning you can control and activate your R2 unit from the comfort of your own smartphone or smart device.</p>
<p><em>Although, you may need to have the most up-to-date version of your operating system installed.</em></p>

<h2>Realistic Movements, Lights, and Sound</h2>
<p>So, what can you expect should you get this little droid? Well, one of the best things about the toy (can you even call it that?) is the fact that it offers so-called &lsquo;authentic movement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If you watch the videos of the app-enabled R2-D2 in action, you'll see that it moves much like the real deal from the films. The droid has both bipod and tripod stances, and even waddles from side to side too. Check out what R2 can do, in this neat video:</p>

<p>Aside from that, there are front and rear LED lights which are fully functional and perceptive. Plus, the integrated speaker, means that R2D2&rsquo;s signature beep and boop sounds come straight from the gadget itself. In case you&rsquo;re wondering, it honestly does not get more realistic than this.</p>
<h2>Watch Star Wars with R2-D2</h2>
<p>In the depths of your wildest dreams, have you ever imagined that you would be able to sit down and watch your favourite Star Wars episode with R2-D2 sitting beside you? Well, now you can.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting features that the droid has to offer is the &lsquo;Watch with Me&rsquo; feature. When you pop on an episode from the Star Wars saga, the droid will react in real time to everything that&rsquo;s happening on the screen.</p>
<h2>Oh, and Droid-to-Droid Action</h2>
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;ve got any friends who also have a Star Wars themed droid, R2-D2 can interact with them. Get these two little robots in the same room and watch them have a full-blown conversation. (Well, as full-blown as a conversation can be when it mostly consists of incomprehensible sounds.)</p>

<h2>R2-D2 Price and Release Date</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s good news if you&rsquo;re hoping to get your hands on the R2-D2 Droid in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>The little app-enabled gadget has actually already been released and can be ordered online now! Yes. Of course, a high-end toy like this one was never going to be cheap, but it's available online right now for &pound;128.04.</p>

<p>Why not pair your R2-D2 droid with a new smartphone, say, something from a galaxy far, far away. Like Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>
