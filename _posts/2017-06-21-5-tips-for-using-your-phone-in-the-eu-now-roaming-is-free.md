<p>Under some new laws, mobile phone roaming is now free in the EU. Hurrah! That means no more heavy charges for UK holidaymakers when posting sunny selfies abroad.</p>
<p>However, there are five things we think you need to bear in mind now that you can roam like home in the EU.</p>
<h2>1) Beware of Borders</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re traveling in the EU, you might think that the only signals you can pick up are native ones. Um, not quite.</p>
<p>When near a geographical border, there&rsquo;s a chance you could inadvertently pick up a signal a neighbouring country&rsquo;s signal. The problem is, if that country isn&rsquo;t covered by the new EU laws, you could incur extra charges. Better to be safe than sorry!</p>

<h2>2) Internet Speeds May be Slower</h2>
<p>Despite roaming charges disappearing, you should know that using your phone abroad may mean slower data speeds. If you&rsquo;re on EE, you&rsquo;ll get 4G internet no matter where you are in the EU. Phew.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Three, though, you may have to settle for 3G. Either way, you should find that you have a decent enough signal to do things like check Facebook and find where you are, using a maps app.</p>
<h2>3) Check Which European Countries Are Covered</h2>
<p>While you may think that it&rsquo;s just EU countries included in the recent roaming changes, the best network providers are offering extra destinations.</p>
<p>Get an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee" target="_blank">EE Max Plan</a> and you benefit from free roaming in 48 EU countries, plus an extra five worldwide, including USA, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Beating that, <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/three" target="_blank">Three Advanced plans</a> now give you free roaming in 60 worldwide destinations.</p>

<h2>4) Avoid Going Over Your Allowance</h2>
<p>When using your data abroad, make sure you don&rsquo;t go over your allowance. The cost of doing so might be more than in the UK.</p>
<h2>5) Avoid Calling the EU from Home</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the new legislation confuse you! It applies when you&rsquo;re in Europe. Not when you&rsquo;re at home. You&rsquo;ll still be charged extra for calling EU countries from the UK, and so it&rsquo;s better to use Skype or the like to get in touch with people on the continent.</p>
