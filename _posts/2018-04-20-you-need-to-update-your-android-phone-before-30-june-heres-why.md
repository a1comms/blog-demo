<p>If you&rsquo;re an Android phone user, there&rsquo;s something you should know. If your device is running an OS older than Android 5.0 Lollipop, you need to update it as soon as possible. Failing to do so could make using the internet very hard (or impossible) on your device. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<h2>So, What's the Deal?</h2>
<p>Without getting too technical about it all, the way that online payments are processed is going through some minor changes.</p>
<p>Last year, the PCI Security Standards Council announced that payment processors and merchants would need to upgrade their certificates by 30th June this year.</p>
<p>Then, at the start of February, it was announced that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 b would start to depreciate, i.e. stop working&hellip;</p>
<p>That deadline is fast approaching. If website owners fail to update their certificate to TLS 1.2 by the end of June, it could mean that payments stop working. That could be a huge problem for eCommerce sites and, in fact, any site that uses a payment system. Yikes.</p>
<p><em>But if you&rsquo;re just a regular person using the internet, how will all this affect you? Well&hellip;</em></p>
<h2>What Does This Mean for Android Phones?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17241" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8ZD3tyZJMNpl_dkTBjnr9SuWna1WOAqUKbC0aDgI_PDLWK2IkfFZik8vCZ7kmKolIPHDxbwKMpq7rUg2TCcwriA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s not 100% clear which Android operating systems will support the TLS 1.2 certificate. While we do know that everything after <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 5.0 Lollipop</a> should be fine, there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation about whether earlier versions of the system will work or not.</p>
<p>Of course, only a small number of users still run an older version of Android, but it&rsquo;s still worth checking to see whether this will affect you. When the changes come into effect this summer, it could mean that you&rsquo;re unable to make payments online on your phone.</p>
<h2>What Should You Do About It?</h2>
<p>Worried that your phone has an older version of the Android operating system? The easiest thing you can do about it is update it right now.</p>
<p>On most Android devices, you can do this by heading to <strong>Settings > About Device > Update</strong>. If you&rsquo;re able to update, there should be an option that allows you to install Android 5.0, or a later version.</p>
<p>Sadly, if your Android phone is quite a few years old, you may find that it won&rsquo;t support 5.0 or any later versions of the OS. In that case, there&rsquo;s nothing else for it - <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&rsquo;s finally time to upgrade your phone</a>.</p>
