<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Tick-Tock, its Apple o&rsquo;clock&hellip;</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time of year. Not just for the mobile industry, which has received its first batch of flagships for 2016, and is full of promise for many more... but also for a closely related industry, the wearable cousin of smartphones.</p>
<p>You guessed it, smartwatches. And none are quite as exciting as the rumoured successor to the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Aptly named Apple Watch 2, the Cupertino giant&rsquo;s second foray into the world of smartwatches is going to be the benchmark setter for all future wearables.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Rumours point to a new design, one that will feature a thinner body, less of a frame and more screen. This we like, because the competition is growing in size and features, and Apple will need to cater to market demand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s speculated that Apple may opt for a circular watch face, this time round (pun intended), rather than the soft-edged square as featured on the first generation.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Apple Watch 2 is expected to use a new type of display, called &ldquo;micro LED&rdquo;. This technology was acquired by Apple back in 2014, and can be up to 30 times brighter than OLED displays. This would come in handy for use outside in bright conditions.</p>
<p>One other key screen feature that people are talking about, is the development of the haptic sensor, in order to create a 3D Touch experience similar to that on iPhone 6s. The display on Apple Watch is already pressure-sensitive, though functions are limited.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Other additions to the device may include a GPS chip, which will allow for the Watch 2 to become a truly bona fide sports tracker. Naturally the new Watch is expected to feature a bigger battery, more powerful processor and be available in a new range of materials and colours.</p>
<h2>Straps</h2>
<p>In our opinion, the one rumour that&rsquo;s eclipsing the rest is, aside from being a long shot, light straps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been rumoured that Apple Watch 2 may be available with a light-up watch strap, which would give you an extra way of receiving notifications as they translate across the strap, and could lead to some incredibly inventive themes.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch 2 Release Date</h2>
<p>We wish we could say today, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s not the case. Though it shouldn&rsquo;t be much longer now, as Apple Watch 2 is heavily speculated to be in production, ready for an unveiling alongside a new iPhone in September.</p>
