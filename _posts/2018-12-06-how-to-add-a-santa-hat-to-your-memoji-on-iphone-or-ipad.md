<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">'Tis the season to Memoji!</span></p>
<p>The holidays are coming&hellip; So, why not celebrate the festive season by giving your Memoji a little Christmas twist? You can actually pop a Santa hat on top of your Memoji&rsquo;s head in no time at all. So, for a second, stop whatever you&rsquo;re doing and do this instead!</p>
<h2>Which devices support Memoji?</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, you need to know whether your particular Apple device has Memoji on it. You will need one of the latest iPhones or iPads before you can start using this fun and quirky little extra. Here are the devices that support the feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone X</li>
<li><a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xr-64gb-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone XR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone XS</a></li>
<li>iPhone XS Max</li>
<li>2018 11-inch iPad Pro</li>
<li>2018 12.9-inch iPad Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, if you happen to have an iPad or iPhone that predates the ones listed here, you won&rsquo;t be able to use Memoji. The feature needs Face ID and iOS 12 to work, which means that devices without it simply don&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>

<h2>How to give your Memoji a Santa hat</h2>
<p>Ready to give your Memoji a little festive makeover? It won&rsquo;t take you all that long. Slipping a holiday hat on your character is as easy as one, two, three. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Messages app</strong> and then hit the <strong>Animoji symbol</strong> (hint: It&rsquo;s a monkey face!). Next, you need to tap the little &lsquo;<strong>+&rsquo; button</strong> next to the list of ready-made Animoji. You will then be taken through a step-by-step way to create your very own character in mere minutes. It&rsquo;s much-like the old SIMs character-maker.</p>
<p>When you have created a character that you love or one that looks like you, it&rsquo;s time to go to the headwear category. Scroll down until you see the Santa hat. It&rsquo;s quite near the bottom of the page so make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>Since the hat colour won&rsquo;t automatically be red, you may not spot the hat right away as it will look different. Change the tone using the colour picker at the top of the page. You can, of course, go for the traditional bright red or mix it up with something deeper or darker.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done all of the above, your Memoji will be ready for the holiday season. You can start using it right away by sending it to your friends or using it when you FaceTime.</p>
