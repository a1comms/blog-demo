<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Text and call wherever there's WiFi!</span></p>
<p><span class="postStandFirst">EE has launched WiFi Calling, a new service that allows you to make calls and send texts over your WiFi, even without any coverage.</span></p>
<p>Designed to benefit those in low-signal areas, <a href="http://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/network/wifi-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EE&rsquo;s WiFi Calling</a> service is rolling out to selected devices from 10<sup>th</sup> April.</p>
<p>To begin with, WiFi Calling will be available on the following mobile phones: iPhone 5s, 5c, 6 and 6 Plus. As well as EE branded Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S5 devices.</p>
<p>Unlike other communication services like WhatsApp and Skype, EE&rsquo;s WiFi Calling integrates itself into your dialler, for a much more streamlined experience. In other words, you can use your mobile phone as normal, even when your signal is patchy.</p>
<p>Keeping things simple, WiFi Calling won&rsquo;t introduce any changes to your bill, as both minutes and texts come straight out of your allowance. Out of allowance calls are charged at your standard rate.</p>
<p>WiFi Calling is available across all EE pay monthly and small business plans, with 4GEE Corporate plans in line to get it this summer.</p>
<p>Below are instructions on how you can get WiFi Calling up and running on your mobile phone.</p>
<h2>How to set WiFi Calling up for your iPhone</h2>
<ol>
<li>First of all, you need to check if your iPhone 5s, 5c, 6 or 6 Plus has the latest software, which can be done by heading to Settings > General > Software Update.</li>
<li>Once your iPhone is up to date, make sure you&rsquo;re connected to your WiFi, then head to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calls > then turn Allow Wi-Fi Calls on.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re connected to your WiFi, you&rsquo;ll notice the script &lsquo;WiFi Calls&rsquo; at the top of your screen. Hurrah! You&rsquo;re good to go.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to set WiFi Calling up for your Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t received a text message informing you that WiFi Calling has been enabled on your Samsung Galaxy S6 or S6 edge, then text &lsquo;WiFi Calling&rsquo; to 150.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll then receive a message to confirm that WiFi Calling has been activated. This can take up to a few hours.</li>
<li>Next, you need to connect to your WiFi, then hit Settings > Application > Phone > WiFi Calling. Tap the little box and a pop-up window will ask you to enable WiFi Calling. Press &lsquo;ok&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;ll notice a WiFi Calling indicator at the top of your display.
