<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Tips and tricks to boost your iPhone speed and performance.</span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a slow smartphone, am I right?</p>
<p>Sadly, this happens to the best of us! As devices get older, they will often start slowing down, much to your irritation.</p>
<p>So, if your iPhone is beginning to show signs of feeling old and tired, here are some tricks you can try to speed it back up. Back to the good old days when it was fresh out of the box.</p>
<h2>1) Don&rsquo;t Force-Close Your Apps</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16365" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2gWsmgrRR4xz-PB7ckO9LHJDyqqJpdvYaocVxDHPVhmiUMs1gih09E_NfvooltahSE2DJzrKTZ7vjEUDAYq8PqY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many people believe that force-quitting all their apps (by double tapping the home button and swiping apps up) will make their iPhone run faster and save battery. Sadly, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>In reality, it takes much more power to close and then re-open apps than to leave them running in the background. Trying this misguided &lsquo;hack&rsquo; may mean your iPhone runs slower and kills battery.</p>
<h2>2) Kill Any Unused Apps</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16366" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hWBB2tJVVi_STh8cjHsu3Qk1DgtyT1LRs0fX_NcEZ75MbZWXKIc_oB7Ob9IieA8S2ICQa3pVf5_JvMEcL-ubGzU=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While quitting your apps won&rsquo;t make much difference, deleting them absolutely will.</p>
<p>Every now and then, it pays to go through your app list and delete the ones that you don&rsquo;t use. After all, there&rsquo;s no use clogging up your device with useless downloads, right?</p>
<h2>3) Power Siri Down</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16367" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UXCThOKkxldXVKTNIG_iTALd1NPlSSX1xDn1EXbm6I0fb8wFvb3DXcpd7VbN-3BOFpxeM7oiiFWEhBF3YWviasb5LA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spoiler: Siri may be playing havoc with your phone! It could be that your device is slow thanks to suggestions from Siri.</p>
<p>To stop that from happening, you just need to do one thing. Head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>Siri &amp; Search </strong>and then toggle off &lsquo;<strong>Suggestions in Search</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Suggestions in Look Up</strong>.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>4) Update Your iPhone ASAP</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16368" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1SnedX2ZNbah6qvCTSei0giv1N1oXFNMDs9HJTUXDhucTs1KQEJeLYzNo8yDF4_jYmTHfXt8HrfQNlQjQ88kruFo=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When was the last time that you updated your iPhone? If you&rsquo;ve been ignoring that little red notification, it may be time to change your ways. Updating the software on your device is likely to fix any bugs that could be slowing it down.</p>
<p>To update your iPhone go to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>General</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong></p>
<h2>5) Clear Your Cookies and Cache</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16369" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RUb2xMC9eKe7XxDbYQB83aEpek3fF53rQ-XC2AXr1O-0Cm149IEL9HvSckxNhM5T3fcCigF3w3IYR7ZWAjOR18-C=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Getting rid of cookies and clearing your cache is sure to free up some space and make your phone work faster than ever.</p>
<p>Head to the settings page to clear out your Safari app. With other apps, you may need to go to their individual help/settings pages.</p>
<h2>6) Switch Off Automatic Downloads</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16370" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F0GwZn4VQQuQ6ZeVr8WmyMslAFWCRJemie13G2Hn5ou2zNnJqrPbYlHtWWYTXT5naqdOfOFyrNU_0n_TCI4jBu4i=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t even know that this feature is switched on. It allows your iPhone to automatically update apps whenever new ones are available.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that your phone will slow down during the download periods. Which could be at any time! Go to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>iTunes and App Store </strong>and then toggle off the <strong>Automatic Downloads</strong> feature.</p>
<h2>7) Give Your iPhone a Rest</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16371" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Opyb8jvdTceMe37Xx5xqqsSt5u4FtEPPnAhp2cD1DKv47YwFFKtYT_VeVyfKXnQHT_JdR7S2QBeZr8kNPmhdSg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>It may sound like a radical move as so few of us actually turn our devices off these days, but you may want to try it. Powering off your phone now and then could help to boost its power and make it work a little quicker than it does now.</p>
<p>To turn it off, just hold down the power button for a few seconds, and slide the on-screen toggle to the right.</p>
<h2>8) Erase Your Content</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16372" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bygZDEvXcGmfB47VDjwlZo9KyiBDrkMrQ5zdK29A7x2LhZ3625jaXJZMpH-guwV1AnErRhHeR_ty52cj9B4FeFyW=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had it up to here <em>*holds hand high above head*</em> with your iPhone being slow and annoying, here&rsquo;s one final option. Erase your data. Yes, it&rsquo;s a wild one, but it&rsquo;s sure to make a rather major difference.</p>
<p>Just go to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>General </strong>><strong> Reset</strong> > <strong>Erase All Content and Settings&nbsp;</strong>and watch the magic at work. Remember to back your iPhone up before you resort to this move.</p>
