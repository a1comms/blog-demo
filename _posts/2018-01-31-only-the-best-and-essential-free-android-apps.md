<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Don&rsquo;t spend a penny or waste precious phone space: these Android apps are all free and essential.</span></p>
<p>Does it ever feel like there are simply too many apps in the Google Play store? And you just don&rsquo;t know where to start?</p>
<p>Finding the best free Android apps is anything but easy, mainly because there&rsquo;s so much choice out there. In fact, there over 1 million apps to choose from!</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re ready to fill your Android mobile phone with all the essential free apps, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. From news, to messaging, to music streaming and lots in between, we&rsquo;ve sought out the very best Android apps so that you don&rsquo;t have to. You can download all of them free today.</p>
<h2>1) Google Opinion Rewards</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13427" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rDx1al7A6m7USO5INUy2p1Fgm53Klso4ujSjTXblvd3mE7Jj3Ohoc_we4Y1QqGh4vCG2L5jRtULfM8t-jCJt3V8=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, your opinion is a valuable commodity. Companies want to know what <em>you </em>think about everything from current affairs to the products they sell.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a spare few minutes a day (seriously, that&rsquo;s all it takes!), using the Google Opinion Rewards app could be a mini goldmine.</p>
<p>This essential Android app allows you to answer surveys and win credits for doing so. You can then spend the credits in the Google Play Store on anything from albums to games. Absolute no-brainer!</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Google Opinion Rewards</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>2) Groupon</h2>

<p>Why pay over the odds for things when you can get a cheeky discount? If you&rsquo;re part of bargain-loving Britain (I know that I am!), Groupon is one of the best free Android apps you can download.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got the Groupon app, you just need to set your location and start browsing the deals. From cheapo meals out, to services such as waxing and haircuts, there&rsquo;s sure to be something you&rsquo;ll love here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a hint: don&rsquo;t bother sifting through all the deals to find what you need. You can choose which category you want to search by pressing a tab at the top of the app. Plus, there&rsquo;s a search bar if you want something really specific.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groupon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Groupon</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>3) Google Duo</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16507" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i2dAKaHEnl6cxzwO_wykW5RdFNChqFYPyP53gUY7u0SJgxOnXyNvIP1HRuMkZFNdcQgv42Kmf3nDmclNVvDA2QY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Video chatting is nothing particularly new. (Oh hello, Skype, FaceTime, Facebook Video&hellip;) Still, there are a couple of small things that make Google Duo an essential Android app. For one thing, the setup is very simple. You download the app, enter a code that&rsquo;s sent to you via text, and start using the features. That&rsquo;s it. There&rsquo;s no hassle about making an account or logging in via Facebook.</p>
<p>The other feature that really does make this app stand out is the &lsquo;Knock Knock&rsquo; calling system. As soon as someone starts to video call you, you get a live stream of them on your screen (yes, <em>before </em>you&rsquo;ve answered!). That means that you can start the call immediately by tapping the accept button and chit-chatting away.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Google Duo</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>4) Periscope</h2>
<h2><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GGXmWYv6PU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></h2>
<p>If a picture&rsquo;s worth a thousand words, a live stream must be worth about a million, right? If you&rsquo;ve not got Periscope yet, where on earth have you been?</p>
<p>The live streaming social network, by none other than Twitter, is one of the greatest ways to see what people are doing around the globe.</p>
<p>Once you download Periscope, you&rsquo;ll need to sign in using your Twitter account information. After that, though, you will have a world of streams and &lsquo;saved&rsquo; videos at your fingertips. Browse the channels - from music to comedy - and find something that brightens your day.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.periscope.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>5) WhatsApp</h2>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re starting a group chat or just sending media to your friends, there&rsquo;s no doubt that WhatsApp is the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>While there are many different messaging apps on the market, this essential Android app is by far the most popular. What&rsquo;s more, it offers fun little extras, such as the ability to assign a picture to a group and change the background of your chat screens.</p>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, the messaging app is 100% free to download and works with your number to access your contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>6) Evernote</h2>

<p>Forget carrying a scrapbook in your pocket, Evernote is the app that makes note-taking as simple as can be.</p>
<p>Download this free app on your Android device and your laptop right away. The two apps will work in sync, so when you note something down on your phone, it will automatically appear on your laptop too.</p>
<p>In fact, Evernote is an essential app that works across a whole wide range of gadgets, which means that you can sync up everything from your to-do list to the beginnings of your first novel. Easy peasy!</p>

<h2>7) Pocket</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OSGHHLvpwI?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>With so many great articles and blogs online these days (no need to mention any specifics), you must hardly know where to start. The truth of the matter is that there&rsquo;s more reading material out there that any of us can handle.</p>
<p>When you happen to come across something interesting, though, you don&rsquo;t always have the time to sit down and give it your full attention. The Pocket app solves this problem for you in one simple way: it allows you to save articles and the like for later by digitally folding them up and popping them in your pocket.</p>
<p>Pocket lets you either save things from your browser or from other apps, such as Twitter. When you head back to the app, you can pick up where you left.</p>
<p>This free Android app is available across a whole load of gadgets so you really have no excuse for not having it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pocket</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>8) Duolingo</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OebgtUjLg4?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not about to sit here and lecture you on the benefits of learning a second language. Not only is this skill useful for travel, but it will also help to keep your mind active and alert well into later life. But, you know that, right?</p>
<p>What you might not know, though, is the fact that learning a language doesn&rsquo;t <em>have </em>to cost you a small fortune. Sure, there are expensive classes and programs out there that claim to help you become fluent in no time at all, but what if your finances are tight?</p>
<p>Ah, well, that&rsquo;s where Duolingo comes into play. The free Android app can help you learn a whole array of languages through games, flashcards, and tests. It&rsquo;s super simple to use and feels more like a fun little game than a full-on &lsquo;educational app&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From French to Russian, all you have to do now is choose a lingo to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Duolingo</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<h2>9) 1Password</h2>
<h2><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcly2-b1W20" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h2>
<p>Trying to remember all your passwords can be something of a nightmare. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I end up having to try about five different ones anytime I happen to get &lsquo;locked out&rsquo; of an app or page.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier if you just had to remember <em>one </em>password rather than a whole bunch of them? If you&rsquo;re already screaming &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s an essential Android app that you need to download for free right now.</p>
<p>As the name would suggest, 1Password is the app that remembers all your niggly little passwords for you. All you have to do is unlock the app using either your thumbprint or a password of your choice. Note: The service is free to use for the first 30 days, but then you will have to pay a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>1Password</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>
<h2>10) TED</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13432" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OVSy2Tf5SU5O_jaFIjdc9OlZSfj1tzLg6mukb3CTLsGbOAZ8wHL7gIqio-h2vmpUDteRzWHme4c8aA-WOX7CNUE6=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Technology, Entertainment, and Design come together in one beautiful little package. If you&rsquo;re ready to expand your mind and learn some new (and, frankly, cool) stuff, TED is the best free Android app to help you along the way.</p>
<p>This essential Android app gives you access to more than 2,000 utterly fascinating TED talks. It&rsquo;s really hard to define what subject matters they cover, since you can find everything from speeches on feminism, to explanation on how certain gadgets work.</p>
<p>Plus, if you can&rsquo;t decide what to watch first, it&rsquo;s worth dipping into the TED Radio Hour to find out what&rsquo;s new. With all this free information and content at your fingertips, you&rsquo;ll never be bored again. You&rsquo;re welcome!</p>

<h2>11) Quartz</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13340" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5l3tMZ4o9RVK_lbaRE2bH5sGJgj5dfbBy3O97WJAL_0IPZ245JNqzXKGImfDwusD3iuUK7kL7SXKPZ7QPVfzO5U=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>These days, there are so many ways of consuming the news and media that it might all feel a little overwhelming. That&rsquo;s where the free Android app, Quartz, comes into play.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where a friend texts you all the latest news updates as they happened. Sounds pretty convenient, right? Well, that&rsquo;s pretty much Quartz in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Quartz is arguably one of the best free Android apps for news, since it curates all the latest headlines and sends them direct to your smartphone in text message form. You can even interact with the app with text-like replies, to learn more about a story or move onto the next piece of news. Staying clued up on current affairs has never been easier or more enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Download Quartz for free</strong></p>
<h2>12) Android Pay</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t be the only one who <em>still</em> feels like James Bond, whenever I hold my phone against a card reader to pay for something?</p>
<p>Using Android Pay, you can use your phone to pay for items in stores, when using the London Underground and to check out quickly in apps. It literally replaces your wallet and it&rsquo;s free to use.</p>
<p>For anyone concerned about security, don&rsquo;t be, Android Pay doesn&rsquo;t share your card number when transacting, but generates a virtual one. And you won&rsquo;t need to enter your card pin at any point.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Pay</a> for free</strong></p>

<h2>13) Google Allo</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXEkoXgb4bI?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>On the surface, Google Allo is just another messaging app. Since you&rsquo;ve probably already downloaded the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, you might ask whether there&rsquo;s any point in nabbing this free Android app. Well, there&rsquo;s one major difference between all the other chat apps and this one: a little thing called Google Assistant.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re chitter-chattering with your bestie, you can also ask Google pretty much anything you want. For example, if you want to find a theatre near you, you just have to use the &lsquo;@goolgle&rsquo; tag during the conversation and ask. The Google bot will answer your question without interrupting the flow of your conversation.</p>
<p>There also more ways to express yourself, with fun stickers, doodles, emoji and text.</p>
<p><strong>Download Google Allo for free</strong></p>
<h2>14) Prisma</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13334" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5L5CzHjBs3IdA-09ksRauLo4DzcMhCu-j71_fjaiGi9yVw5PdEww4NlETm7bDEabZJ6ZlJTj8ETk6w8Ldw2OS6IchA=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Getting the perfect Instagram snap is something of an art form these days. So, what better free Android app to download than the rather wonderful Prisma?</p>

<p>If you have yet to give this top Android app a whirl, it might just be time you got on it.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neuralprisma&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a> for free</strong></p>

<h2>15) Spotify</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13328" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NPfEp9P4_y1HRZ15pc-0xEKtuO4iPki7Dpn5IjCYsIkh2dYE8jqOQiAc6kqFR4FqEON-Y0TV4F9HA46IJqch-ms=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it: Spotify has changed the way that we consume music.</p>
<p>Back in the day, you&rsquo;d like an artist, head to the local HMV, and buy yourself their album. While some people still love the nostalgia of that ritual, few of us bother with it these days. Instead, the free Spotify app allows you to stream (almost) all the music in the world at the tap of your screen.</p>
<p>You can use the free version of the subscription or upgrade to premium if you want an advert-free listening experience. Want to listen when you&rsquo;re offline? You can also save songs so that you can listen to them without using your data or Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> for free</strong></p>
<h2>16) Google Wallpapers</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13336" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PeGiuhrPNmbJnqFahGZJLaSzrYrt9c8iNQQN2FKt41Zq3Rr8VgfPsn3WJNdTf07onSUp6Rb0U-2j8Da8lf7anO4e=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>When it comes to personalising your Android phone, there are generally two ways to go. First off the bat, you can be the type of person who uses a picture of their pet, significant other, or indeed their child as a phone background. That way, whenever you use your phone you see the thing or person you love most in the world. (For me, this is my cat).</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other option, of decorating your phone background using a professional-looking wallpaper. Without paying of course. What you want is Google Wallpapers, one of the most essential Android apps, which comes packed full of a wide variety of backgrounds, including some stunning pictures from Google Earth. Your phone will never look the same again.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wallpaper&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Wallpapers</a> for free.</strong></p>

<h2>17) Pushbullet</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SdAzP-5sUw?ecver=2" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>There are times when it&rsquo;s simply not convenient to use your phone to reply to a chat message or text. That&rsquo;s why you have to get yourself the Pushbullet Android app. Once downloaded, you can use it to sync both your SMS messages and in-app messages (a la WhatsApp and the like) to your laptop. That means that you can quickly and easily reply to anyone at any time without even needing to pick up your phone. Genius.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushbullet</a> for free</strong></p>
<h2>18) Strava</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b63tLbiTiko?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a keen runner or cyclist, Strava is the best Android app for you.</p>
<p>Strava uses the GPS on your phone to track your progress when running or, indeed, cycling around a particular route. Doubtless, one of the greatest things about this app is the fact that it works with just so many different wearables. If you have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, the likelihood is that you can use the Strava app with it!</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve completed a particular route, you can even share it on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Go on&hellip; Let the world know how damn fit you really are.</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a> for free</strong></p>

<h2>19) Uber</h2>

<p>Hailing a cab is a thing of the past with Uber.</p>
<p>In all honesty, the free Android app really has changed the way that many of us travel. With just the touch of a button, you can call a cab to come pick you up wherever you are. You can then watch the little car icon as it drives toward your location and the minute-by-minute timer goes down.</p>
<p>The Android app syncs with your bank, so payments automatically get deducted after your trip. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the &lsquo;split fare&rsquo; feature means that you and a friend or group can share the cost of the journey easily and without any arguments.</p>
<p>Of course, security is kind of a massive deal for Uber, which is why you can see your driver&rsquo;s name, face (in picture form), and registration number before they even pick you up. The rating system also means that you can give direct feedback about your driver after your trip. Taxi, please!</p>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a> for free</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to a particular city, getting from place to place can be something of a logistical nightmare. If you don&rsquo;t want to waste time reading bus timetables or trying to decipher underground maps, here&rsquo;s an essential Android app for you.</p>
<p>Citymapper is very straightforward to use and can get you where you need to be in the quickest possible time. All you have to do is pick your city, enter your location and where you want to go, letting this free app do the rest. Right away, Citymapper will plan the fastest route for you, using all the available forms of public transport. It will even give you live travel times so you never miss the bus, train, or underground ever again.</p>

<p>While file-sharing might not be the most exciting of subjects, it is something that&rsquo;s useful to many of our day-to-day lives. Whether you&rsquo;re sending your mum a photo album or sharing a presentation with a colleague, Dropbox is one of the best Android apps you can get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, quick, and easy to use: choose what files you want to send to another Dropbox user, click a button and, voil&agrave;, it&rsquo;s done. Nothing could be easier.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many (<em>many!) </em>messaging apps in the Play Store. However, if you want one which allows you to host group conversations, video chat, and even send some cool stickers to boot, this might be the best free Android app for you. For a long time, Hangouts has set the standard when it comes to messaging.</p>
<p>Like many of Google&rsquo;s free apps, Hangouts is ultra-straightforward. Simply download it, sign in, and start chatting away. Unsurprisingly, you&rsquo;ll need a Gmail address to use this essential Android app. Once signed in, you can access and chat with your Gmail contacts whenever you please.</p>
<p><strong>Download </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Google Hangouts</strong></a><strong> for free</strong></p>

<p>Go to your local coffee house and you&rsquo;ll see the same thing: people everywhere lost in their phones. While we can&rsquo;t blame them (because we totally love phones!), it feels like the once-cherished book is dying out&hellip; That&rsquo;s unless you have Google Play Books!</p>
<p>As the name would suggest, Google Play Books is an essential Android app for fellow bookworms. You can buy books from a whole range of stores (i.e. <em>not </em>just the Google Play Store) and read them on this free app. What&rsquo;s more, you can also download free books and enjoy them for the sweet, sweet price of nothing at all.</p>
