<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Premium power vs. great value. What will you decide?</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re about ready to upgrade to a new phone, you might be thinking about which is best for you.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s a whole load of super snazzy devices on the market. Two of the best happen to be brand-new iPhone Xs Max and the already-popular <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P20 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Are you undecided? Then you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>When it comes to the design of these two devices, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are some striking similarities. In fact, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find two devices more alike in looks than the P20 Pro and the iPhone Xs Max. Both are clean and minimalist. They each have an almost-bezeless design with a small notch at the top of the screens.</p>

<p>You might need to play &lsquo;spot the difference&rsquo; to notice the minor variations here. There&rsquo;s a small home button on the P20 Pro but you won&rsquo;t find one on iPhone Xs Max at all. The colours are also different. The P20 Pro comes in <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-twilight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twilight</a>, whereas iPhone Xs Max comes in Silver, Gold, and Space Grey.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>Screen size and quality are kind of a big deal these days, and here&rsquo;s where the Huawei loses out. The device sports a 6.1-inch 1080 x 2240 OLED display. It&rsquo;s not bad and, for most phone users, it should be impressive enough. However, iPhone Xs Max takes things to a whole new level. It boasts a 6.5-inch screen with a Super Retina HD OLED display, which is the same type of incredible tech that we saw on iPhone X.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the comparison really starts heating up. iPhone Xs Max has a remarkable camera offering: You&rsquo;ve got a dual-lens rear camera with a 12MP wide lens and a 12 MP telephoto lens working in sync. There&rsquo;s also a 7MP selfie camera on the front. Smart HDR allows you to bring more light and darkness into photos without losing clarity. You&rsquo;ve also got the improved Bokeh and Depth Control, which will help will it comes to taking portrait.</p>

<p>Huawei P20 Pro&rsquo;s camera is a truly awesome one. There&rsquo;s no denying that fact. The rear setup has a 40MP f/1.6 monochrome sensor, an 8MP telephoto sensor, and a 12MP f/1.8 RGB sensor. On the front, there&rsquo;s a 24MP selfie cam, too. You&rsquo;ve also got the 5x Hybrid Zoom and low-light picture features. Plus, the camera is AI assisted which should mean that you get a clear and crisp image every time.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>So, what else does each device offer? Well, let&rsquo;s start with the Huawei. The P20 Pro is packed with some of the latest smartphone features. For example, it has super-fast charging, a fingerprint scanner, and an easy-to-use operating system. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed when you choose a mobile like this one. However, it&rsquo;s plain to see that the majority of the focus of this device is on the camera.</p>
<p>iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, is a whole different offering. You&rsquo;ve got your Face ID, an improved version of Siri, and new AR gaming features. All the above means that it&rsquo;s going to be a pretty awesome device all-in-all. Thanks to the new and improved screen, a whole lot more should be available when it comes to picture quality and things like AR, Animoji and the new Memoji.</p>

<h2>Storage and Power</h2>
<p>When it comes to the minor details, the Huawei has a decent offering. There&rsquo;s the octa-core Kirin 970 chipset, 6GB of RAM, and a 4000 mAh battery. All of which means that the device should be fast performing and have a battery that will last long enough for most people&rsquo;s needs. In short, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem here at all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17070" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JHudj0FYeEePNzZV-q1WspJjmZnKivciPyvVYfab1OinQaQS-jdDLEnMycz318n7k5BeK4EGEEORuGJnUVu0BY=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s no word on how large the iPhone Xs Max battery will be, but Apple say that it will give users a whopping 15 hours of video playback. There&rsquo;s also the 6-core CPU and a 4-core GPU processor, as well as the new and improved A12 Bionic chip. It&rsquo;s supposed to be one of the fastest and most efficient iPhones to date, but only time will tell.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s one thing that will likely sway a whole load of people &ndash; the price. So, how much will iPhone Xs Max and Huawei P20 Pro cost you?</p>
<p>iPhone Xs Max really is the best-of-the-best right now. So it has a premium price tag to reflect just that. SIM free, the 64GB storage version iPhone Xs is &pound;1099.</p>
<p>You can spread the cost on a contract voice deal, and get a load of minutes, texts and data, with prices starting from &pound;72 a month with &pound;0 to pay upfront.</p>
<p>The P20 Pro is considerably more affordable, available SIM free at &pound;799. There are plenty of great contract voice deals, too, starting at &pound;32 a month with &pound;0 upfront.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got all the details, which mobile phone will you choose? Well, iPhone Xs Max is the newer, more advanced device. At least, in terms of its main features.</p>
<p>However, it does cost a little more than Huawei P20 Pro, so it depends whether you&rsquo;re willing to pay extra for that level of quality.</p>
<p>The Huawei is still a fantastic enough mobile with a killer camera, with the added bonus of saving you some cash over iPhone Xs Max.</p>
