<p><span class="postStandFirst">The LG Optimus L3 II is a stylish feature-packed handset that offers both functionality and value for money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/lg/lg-optimus-l3-ii"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.buymobilephones.net/prodimg/lg_optimus_l3ii.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="268" /></a>The Optimus range from LG has gone from strength-to-strength, combining value and functionality in some great looking devices.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buymobilephones.net/mobile-phones/lg/lg-optimus-l3-ii">LG Optimus L3 II</a>&nbsp;improves on every aspect that made the original&nbsp;LG Optimus L3&nbsp;such a big hit, offering a faster processor, improved operating system and sharper looks, to name but a few updated features.</p>
<p>Powering the device is a Qualcomm 1GHz Snapdragon processor which, coupled with Android Jelly Bean 4.1, makes for a super-smooth user experience. LG has included some fantastic software additions to Jelly Bean in the form of Quick Memo, a function which allows the user to write on top of any screen and is then saved as an edited screen shot - very useful when you need to take down information quickly.</p>
<p>The handset itself is very neat and compact, offering a 3.2 inch LCD screen, with great viewing angles, which sits nicely in the minimalist frame of the phone. A great little design feature is the addition of an LED light found around the home key, which flashes when notifications are sent to the device.</p>
<p>On the rear of the Optimus L3 II is a capable 3 megapixel camera which takes clear pictures and has some unique software, such as LG's own 'Cheese shutter' which allows the user to take photos via simple vocal commands.</p>
<p>The handset also has on-board memory expansion via microSD of up to 32GB and there is a removable 1540 mAh battery, meaning that the device will have plenty of power to run all day-to-day tasks without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>Great looks, and with well-balanced software and specs, the LG Optimus L3 II is a perfect lower-end device offering real value for money.</strong></p>
