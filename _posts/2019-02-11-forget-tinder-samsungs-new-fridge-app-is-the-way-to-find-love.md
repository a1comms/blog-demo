<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Is the way to <em>your</em> heart through your stomach?</span></p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is just around the corner and if you&rsquo;re currently looking for love, there&rsquo;s a brand new dating app you&rsquo;re going to want to hear about.</p>
<p>One in five relationships now start online in the UK, according to national <a href="https://infogram.com/uk-online-dating-statistics-1grv02gkwz1lm1x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stats</a>, which means that the odds of finding the one are better than ever. Hurrah &ndash;&nbsp;love is soon to be in the air!</p>
<p>The world of online dating is rapidly expanded and getting even more niche! From Twindog to <a href="https://glutenfreesingles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gluten-Free Singles</a>, there&rsquo;s a wide selection of ultra-specific dating platforms that you can try for yourself.</p>
<p>The latest to join the ever-growing list comes from Samsung, who wants to help you find love based on the contents of your fridge.</p>

<h2>Say Hello to Refrigerdating</h2>
<p>Refrigerdating is the coolest new dating app &ndash;&nbsp;literally.</p>
<p>To get started, you simply have to take a snapshot of exactly what&rsquo;s inside your fridge. Then, you share it with an array of food-loving singletons online.</p>
<p>Your potential matches will see the fridge pic (#FridgePic) and swipe left or right on the picture. In theory, it means that you can match with people who are like-minded or, at least, have a similar palette to you. Simple.</p>
<p>The process couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Once you&rsquo;ve gone through the initial setup and taken that all-important picture, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refrigerdating will then hook you up with a variation of fridges, of different tastes, to pick and choose from,&rdquo; says an official <a href="https://www.refrigerdating.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> from Samsung on the Refrigerdating site.</p>

<h2>Samsung Family Hub</h2>
<p>The app also works in sync with the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/refrigerators/family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Family Hub Fridge</a>, which costs in the region of &pound;2,500.</p>
<p>The smart fridges have an array of neat features, such as a touchscreen and an ingredient-tracking camera that mean you see when you&rsquo;re running low on the essentials no matter where you are or what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Luckily, if you&rsquo;ve not got a cool 2K lying around, you don&rsquo;t <em>have </em>to have one of these smart fridges to start using the app.</p>
<h2>Finding Love With the App</h2>
<p>Needless to say, finding that special someone can be a struggle no matter what platform you use.</p>
<p>Luckily, the people at Samsung have shared some handy tips to get you started.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s the most obvious tip &ndash;&nbsp;you must <em>not </em>style your fridge. It has to be 100% authentic, which means no hiding your naughty ready meals behind a bunch of kale!</p>
<p>Other tips include looking for people who actually have different tastes to you and sharing a little more about you when you start talking online.</p>
