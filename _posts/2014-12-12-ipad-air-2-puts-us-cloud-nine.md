<p><strong>People rave about the iPad Air 2, so it&rsquo;s time for us to take a look at Apple's uber-thin tablet, and find out exactly what people love about it. Is it the super-slim body? Is it the 8MP iSight camera? Is it the gorgeous screen? All of the above? Let&rsquo;s find out...</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6154" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/ipadair2c.jpg" alt="ipadair2c" width="800" height="820" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that Apple has an almost indefinable &ldquo;cool factor&rdquo;, which helps to propel all of their devices to new heights (i.e. huge sales), but when it comes to tablets, to the iPad range, which is the coolest tablet of them all?</p>
<p>Simple. It&rsquo;s the iPad Air 2, one of the thinnest tablets ever made! But is it any good?</p>
<p>Actually, no, scratch that, that&rsquo;s a redundant question. It <em>is </em>a good tablet. It&rsquo;s a very good tablet, in fact, but what makes it so nice to use? Let&rsquo;s take a look...</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6155 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Picture2-1024x366.png" alt="Picture2" width="960" height="343" /></p>
<p>We always love to see devices, be they smartphones or tablets, into which the manufacturer has packed a super-fast, hyper-powerful processor. That&rsquo;s why we love phones like the LG G3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5, and it&rsquo;s also why we love the iPad Air 2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to quantify how powerful that A8X processor is (Apple is notoriously reticent to release official speed stats), but there&rsquo;s no doubting the end result; the iPad Air 2 is supremely fast, and the performance is incredibly smooth and responsive. The speed is listed as being 40% faster than its predecessor, and it really does show (and the 64-bit architecture helps to dish out even more speed, while keeping things nicely efficient, to keep the battery life up to 10 hours).</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6156" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Picture3-1024x804.png" alt="Picture3" width="960" height="753" /></p>
<p>With a tablet, the main way you interact with the device is through the screen, so it had better have a <em>good</em> screen.</p>
<p>The iPad Air 2 has a <em>very</em> good screen...</p>
<p>Apple started with a 9.7-inch Retina Display (with a resolution of 2048x1536 pixels), and then fused the three separate layers of the screen down into one layer. That made it thinner, but it also imbued it with even richer colours and better contrast. On top of that, Apple also gave it an anti-reflective coating, and the rend result is, quite frankly, one of the nicest tablet screens we&rsquo;ve seen in ages!</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Security is absolutely paramount in modern devices, and the iPad Air 2 uses a technique that an increasing amount of devices have started to use: biometric security, or more specifically, security based around your <em>fingerprint</em>. Not only does that allow you to unlock your iPad Air 2 with just one touch, but it also lets you make secure purchases through iTunes, iBooks and the App Store!</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s unusual to see a tablet being sold on the strength of its two cameras... well, in fact, it&rsquo;s somewhat unusual to see a tablet that even <em>has</em> two cameras, since most tablets just have a front-facing camera for things like Skype.</p>
<p>The iPad Air 2 does have one of those, of course (and it&rsquo;s a nice one, too), but it <em>also</em> has an 8MP iSight camera on the back. It feels a bit odd to say that you can use your tablet to capture beautiful, sharp photos, but we can&rsquo;t deny that it feels a little bit brilliant to say it, too!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6157 size-large" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Picture11-1024x643.png" alt="Picture1" width="960" height="602" /></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the big defining feature of the iPad Air 2. In fact, it&rsquo;s the thing that gave the iPad Air 2 its name because, like the Macbook Air before it, the iPad Air 2 is <em>super-thin</em>. At only 6.1mm thick, it&rsquo;s one of the slimmest and sexiest tablets money can buy!</p>
<p><strong>And that, in a nutshell is the iPad Air 2, one of the most gorgeous and accomplished tablets currently available. It&rsquo;s slim, it&rsquo;s sexy, it&rsquo;s awesomely powerful, and above all else, it&rsquo;s just <em>nice to use</em>. This one comes highly recommended! </strong></p>
