<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Resist the urge... Do not try this at home.</span></p>
<p>From Kim Kardashian to your aunt Hilda, just about everyone has tried their hand at capturing the perfect selfie.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is now one of the most popular ways in which we share photos of ourselves. No longer do we have to wait for someone to take a natural shot of us while we&rsquo;re out and about. Oh no, now we can spend hours on end posing in front of the mirror trying to achieve the perfect angle and lighting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would say that &lsquo;mirror selfies&rsquo; are the most awkward of the lot. Locking yourself in the bathroom, trying out a series of different poses, will probably never qualify as a productive use of your time, sadly. No matter how strong your pout game is.</p>
<p>Still, some would disagree, as proven by the latest, and possibly most brainless, selfie trend to emerge yet.</p>
<p>Rather than the conventional method of holding a smartphone and snapping away, which is clearly just <em>way</em> too mainstream these days, some millennials are attempting to take a selfie while simultaneously high-fiving themselves&hellip; No, no this is not a joke.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has coined the term &lsquo;extreme selfie-ing&rsquo; yet, but they should and high-five selfies are the reason why&hellip; Attempting to take a photo, whilst clapping your hands together, is only going to spell disaster for your smartphone. Unless you stack a pile of cushions, you&rsquo;re asking for a smashed screen or&nbsp;potential phone fatality.</p>
<p>So, how did it all start? Well, we have Seth Schneider to thank for the high-five selfie craze, pictured above. Since its inception, countless Twitter users have shared their effort at reproducing one, often with unsurprisingly disastrous results&hellip;</p>

<p>One Twitter user changed the game, taking high-five selfies to a new level of stupidity.</p>

<p>With over 120,000 RTs and 450,000 Likes, Schneider&rsquo;s original Tweet has gone nothing short of viral. Ever since, the Twitter&nbsp;has been alive with the sound of smartphones shattering on bathroom floors.</p>
<p>Tempted to try a high-five selfie yourself? No, you&rsquo;re good? OK, maybe next time.</p>
