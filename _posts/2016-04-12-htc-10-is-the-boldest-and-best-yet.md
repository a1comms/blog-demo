<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Join us as we take a look at the newly unveiled HTC 10, the Taiwanese manufacturer&rsquo;s latest flagship, designed to bring the fight to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5...</span></p>
<p>Unlike companies such as Samsung, HTC chose not to show off their newest phone at Mobile World Congress (or host a live event of any sort). Since then, we&rsquo;ve been waiting to see that new flagship, and now, it&rsquo;s here!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the HTC 10!</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The best way to describe the look of the HTC 10 is it&rsquo;s simultaneously similar and <em>dissimilar</em> to HTC One M9, and a whole lot sexier.</p>
<p>The first point is that the build quality is, as ever, utterly superb; the HTC 10 feels rock solid in-hand. It feels like a premium phone with no cut corners, figuratively speaking, because the edges have actually been chamfered.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10125" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/HTC-10-Design.jpg" alt="HTC 10 Design" width="600" height="483" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One standout feature is, much like HTC phones of yore (and unlike the One M9), HTC 10 has hardware buttons just below the screen. That&rsquo;s hugely appreciated, as it frees up room on the 5.2-inch screen (and joy of joys, it&rsquo;s a Quad-HD screen)!</p>
<p>So, in short, the HTC 10 looks gorgeous, and feels even better to use.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>People have tall expectations of modern, flagship smartphones, when it comes to power, with phones like the <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black">Samsung Galaxy S7</a> demonstrating how exactly they should perform.</p>
<p>HTC 10 most definitely lives up to those expectations. It comes with a super-fast quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor, and backing that up is a whopping 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combine that with Android 6 Marshmallow, and it makes for an <em>incredibly</em> responsive phone, completely without stutter or lag.</p>
<p>Basically, HTC 10 handles as beautifully as it looks.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Previous HTC phones have been a mixed bag, when it comes to their camera; experiments like their UltraPixel and Duo Cameras have been interesting, but they never really managed to grab the public consciousness.</p>
<p>And thus, HTC has gone with something more traditional this time out; the HTC 10 comes with a 12MP camera, with laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS), and a lens with a nice wide aperture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10126" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/HTC-10-Camera-1.jpg" alt="HTC 10 Camera" width="600" height="254" /></p>
<p>So, basically, you can expect superb photos from it, but you can also expect superb selfies from the <em>front-facing</em> camera.</p>
<p>HTC has dubbed it an &ldquo;UltraSelfie&rdquo; camera; it&rsquo;s got a 5MP sensor, the same big aperture as the main camera, <em>and</em> it&rsquo;s the first front-facing camera to boast OIS.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll sum it up with three words: best selfies <em>ever</em>.</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>There is one area where HTC phones have always trounced the opposition: sound.</p>
<p>With those BoomSound stereo speakers, the sound output of HTC phones utterly mullers the competition, and this is still true of HTC 10!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10127" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/04/HTC-10-Sound-1.jpg" alt="HTC 10 Sound" width="600" height="254" /></p>
<p>In fact, HTC 10&rsquo;s sound is better than ever, with a new set of amplifiers that are twice as powerful as before, the ability to encode 16-bit audio to 24-bit (i.e. studio quality), and newly improved speakers (as in, the stereo speakers are now split up into woofers and tweeters, just like big speakers).</p>
<p>In short, when it comes to sound quality, basically nothing can beat HTC 10!</p>
<p>And so, we can say with some certainty that the HTC 10 is utterly fantastic. It looks great, it&rsquo;s insanely powerful, the camera&rsquo;s great, and the sound quality from its speakers is second-to-none. Looks like a new gladiator has just entered the arena with the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5...</p>
