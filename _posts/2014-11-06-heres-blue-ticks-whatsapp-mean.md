<p><span class="postStandFirst">WhatsApp has been gifted a new feature that notifies users when their messages have been read, by displaying two small blue ticks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-6003 aligncenter" alt="WhatsApp" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/WhatsApp1-575x1024.jpg" width="460" height="819" /></p>
<p>It would seem that Facebook, who owns WhatsApp, has inconspicuously slipped into our favourite messaging service and left us all a little surprise.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve used WhatsApp today, I&rsquo;m sure you know exactly what I&rsquo;m alluding to. That&rsquo;s right, those two little blue ticks. Now, what exactly are they doing there?</p>
<p>As always, a single grey tick simply notifies you that your message has been sent.</p>
<p>Two grey ticks inform you that your message has been sent, and has been received by your intended recipient.</p>
<p>Well, to be a little scrupulous, those little grey ticks only really tell you that the recipient&rsquo;s phone has received your message, not that they have read it necessarily.</p>
<p>And that brings us back to the incongruous blue ticks that we&rsquo;re all seeing as of today. Of course, they indicate that your message has been sent, received and read.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-6004 aligncenter" alt="WhatsApp Blue Ticks" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-13.02.34.png" width="574" height="159" /><span class="caption">Image: courtesy of whatsapp.com</span></p>
<p>In the case of group chats, which I&rsquo;m sure many of you have (no doubt labelled with some in-joke and cringeworthy name, like I do), the two blue ticks indicate that everyone in the group has read the latest message.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the voyeur of the group, who often pretends you're too busy for idle chit-chat on WhatsApp, your game is well and truly up, my friend.</p>
<p>So, for the good or the bad, it&rsquo;s going to be harder for all of us to avoid our WhatsApp friends. Time to revert back to the stock messaging app on our smartphones?</p>
