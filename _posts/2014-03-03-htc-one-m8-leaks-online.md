<p><span class="postStandFirst">HTC seems to be struggling to keep an airtight lid on its upcoming flagship smartphone, as more HTC One M8 leaks bubble to the surface.<br />
</span></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S4 may well have been the best-selling Android phone of 2013 but its rival, the HTC One, was just as accomplished and just as gorgeous. Now we&rsquo;re just waiting to see what the landscape will be like in 2014; after all, we&rsquo;ve already seen the sleek beauty of the Samsung Galaxy S5, so it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until we get an official look at the successor to the HTC One.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll have to make do with&nbsp;<em>unofficial</em>&nbsp;looks at the next HTC flagship (codenamed the HTC M8), such as the latest leak, being reported on by&nbsp;Engadget.</p>
<p>Will the next HTC handset be as awesome as the flagship HTC One?</p>
<p>There are a number of intriguing details to note, but perhaps the most exciting, for power users, is that the next HTC flagship will see the return of a technology not seen in recent HTC top-enders: expandable storage, in the form of a microSD slot!</p>
<p>Most intriguingly, the HTC M8 appears to have&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;cameras on the back. It&rsquo;s been suggested that these two cameras will work in concert, and produce an image which is an average between the two (making the resulting photo sharper). Combine that with a brushed aluminium finish, and the end result is a&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;desirable phone.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no word on whether the new HTC flagship will be water-resistant (as is the case with both the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the new Sony Xperia Z2), but we are really hoping that&rsquo;s the case.</strong></p>
