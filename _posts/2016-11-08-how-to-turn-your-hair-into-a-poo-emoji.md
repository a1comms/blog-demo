<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">This might be the strangest thing you watch today.</span></p>
<p>With a new line of emojis coming out, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to talk about our favourite mini messaging illustrations. While there are lots of cute and colourful emojis that we all simply adore, there is just one that stands out from the rest: the little pile of poo.</p>
<p>When the folks at Apple first released the poo emoji, they probably had no idea just how popular it would become. Who knew that we were in such dire need of this simple little symbol? It may look like a brown pile of, well, poop, but it has grown to mean much more to millennials.</p>
<p>The poo emoji is a way to express thoughts in a way that&rsquo;s truly comprehensive and meaningful. If we disagree with something or someone, why waste words when a smiling dollop of poo will do? If we want to add a dash of humour to a funny comment, nothing quite says <em>I&rsquo;m hilarious</em> like adding a poop emoji.</p>
<p>Given how significant this emoji has become in the modern world, you may want to pay tribute to it in the best possible way. After all, they do say that imitation is the greatest form of flattery.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> can you imitate the notorious poo emoji, without, erm, making a mess, shall we say?</p>
<h2>How to Turn Your Hair into a Poop Emoji</h2>
<p>Never fear, as always, YouTube has the answer. The Super Deluxe channel apparently recognised that the public has been crying out for a tutorial, and they did not fail to deliver. They <em>knew </em>that in the deepest, darkest corners of our minds, we&rsquo;d dreamt that this day would come. The day when we could finally turn our hair into a poop emoji.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to be blessed with long, luscious locks of hair, you need to check this out. Basically, you can turn your hair into a rather convincing lookalike of that emoji we all know and love. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Take a look at the video:</p>

<p>Essentially, what you need to do is braid your hair, twirl it up so that it makes a poop shape, and then stick on a few, homemade features, being the eyes and mouth. Nothing could be easier, right? We&rsquo;re pretty sure all your friends, family, and even some people you barely know will be impressed by this, so what are you waiting for?</p>
