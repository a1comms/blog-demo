<p>Feel the heat of battle and the feeling of a medieval sword fight, without the risk of serious injury. This VR gaming suit is looking to change the way we experience gaming.</p>

<h2>The Suit</h2>
<p>The Hardlight Suit is designed to fit almost any body type, with comfortable straps to help get the right fit and give you more flexibility when playing more active games.</p>
<p>The suit has built-in tracking, to enable your movements and actions to be traced more accurately while you game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made up from several components and only weighs about 1.6 kilograms, which is around the weight of a light jacket.</p>

<h2>The Technology</h2>
<p>Feel a sword clash against you, enjoy a good old boxing match with friends and interact with different worlds as you become immersed in them, all in the many games you can experience in your VR suit.</p>
<p>The multiple sensors and vibration nodes across the suit give haptic feedback, meaning you&rsquo;ll feel what&rsquo;s happening in the virtual world.</p>
<p>The suit has 16 different haptic zones, meaning lots of areas on your body can experience specific actions direct from games. You&rsquo;ll feel a sword blow to your arm, or an arrow to the chest, just like you're really there.</p>

<p>Not only that, the suit technology is compatible with more than just VR platforms. It can be used with PC and console games too, meaning games can be enjoyed in both VR and just with the suit alone. The suit is compatible with most well-known VR headsets, and some can have audio mode enabled to further immerse yourself in the gaming experience.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more. Not only can you wear your suit when PC and console gaming, bossing your favourite games, you can watch movies and listen to music with the suit and VR too. Experience things on a whole new level and feel reactions in real-time as opposed to through your games controller or TV sound system.</p>
