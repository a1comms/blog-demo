<p><span class="postStandFirst">It was all smiles for Buymobiles.net last night, as we picked up the coveted accolade for the Best Online Retailer at the Mobile Choice Consumer Awards.</span></p>

<p>Over 77,000 consumers voted in this year&rsquo;s Mobile Choice Consumer Awards, choosing Buymobiles.net as the Best Online Retailer for 2014.</p>
<p>Paul Sisson, CEO of A1 Comms, said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more delighted. We work tirelessly to ensure that we provide the very best possible service to our customers, and it&rsquo;s fantastic to see the fruits of our labour recognised by winning this award.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event, which was held at 8 Northumberland Avenue in London, attracted many of the big players in the mobile industry, including EE, Three, Sony, Microsoft and of course, ourselves.</p>
<p>The Mobile Choice Consumer Awards recognise a wide range of mobile services, retailers and manufacturers, with a total of 18 different awards, including Best Network, Best Phone Recycling Service and Phone of The Year - to mention just a few.</p>
<p>British comedian and BBC Radio 4 broadcaster, Alex Horne, took on the role as the comp&egrave;re at the Mobile Choice Consumer Awards. Fortunately, Horne mollified our nerves pretty early on, with the Best Online Retailer category falling second in the running order.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly not strangers to this&nbsp;event, as we have now picked up the Best Online Retailer category four times.</p>
<p>This award joins the Online Retailer award that we won earlier this year at the Mobile News Awards, highlighting how successful 2014 has been for us thus far.</p>
