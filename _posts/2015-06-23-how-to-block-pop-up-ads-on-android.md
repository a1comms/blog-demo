<p><span class="postStandFirst">Pop-up ads. The bane of the internet, the things that <em>no-one</em> likes. They&rsquo;re especially tiresome on mobile devices, so join us as we go through some top tips on how to block pop-up ads on your Android mobile phone.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s universally understood that everyone hates pop-up ads. They&rsquo;re annoying and intrusive, and only serve to delay whatever you&rsquo;re trying to view.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few tips and tricks available to Android users, to help combat these pesky pop-up ads from bombarding you every time you open a web page.</p>
<h2>Switch to Chrome</h2>
<p>Google Chrome is one of the best web browsers available to Android, for many reasons. Prominently, it gives you the option to block pop-up ads!</p>
<p>In fact, that option should be enabled by default. It&rsquo;s easy enough to check: open up Chrome, then go to Menu > Settings > Site Settings > Pop-ups, if it&rsquo;s turned off, simply turn it on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what if you&rsquo;re&nbsp;too attached to the stock Android browser, and don't fancy deserting it?&nbsp;Go to Menu > Settings > Advanced >&nbsp;Content settings > Block pop-ups.</p>

<h2>Turn on Data Saver for Chrome</h2>
<p>Chrome has another setting called &lsquo;Data Saver&rsquo;, found in the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; menu. It compresses websites, killing things like unnecessary animations, to speed up your mobile browsing experience (and potentially reduce cost, as your data allowance isn&rsquo;t consumed as quickly).</p>

<p>Naturally, Data Saver also blocks ad content, but some web pages do render in a strange format, so it might not be for everyone.</p>
<p>You could also try installing an ad-blocker for Chrome, but as that option involves either rooting your phone or manually configuring your network settings, it&rsquo;s probably an option that only advanced users should try.</p>
<h2>Try out Adblock Browser</h2>
<p>So far, this article has more or less been an extended advert for Chrome (largely because Chrome&rsquo;s brilliant), but now we present another option: the people behind the Adblock plugin for desktop browsers have made their own browser!</p>
<p>Granted, it&rsquo;s currently only available in beta (which means joining the Google Plus group for the beta, signing up to be a tester for the app and <em>then</em> downloading the beta version to try out), but it does an excellent job of blocking pop-up ads!</p>
<p>And if that sounds like a lot of faff, then fear not, because once it&rsquo;s been thoroughly tested, the Adblock Browser will eventually be coming to Google Play, for all Android users to download.</p>
<p><strong>Pop-up ads are really annoying, but with these simple tips, you may well find that they never bother you again! </strong></p>
