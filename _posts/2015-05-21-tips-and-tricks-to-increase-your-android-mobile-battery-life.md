<p><span class="postStandFirst">Does the battery life on your smartphone leave something to be desired? Join us as we take a look at some top tips and tricks that&rsquo;ll help you squeeze more battery life out of your Android mobile phone.</span></p>
<p>Android smartphones are powerful things, with screens sharper than we ever thought possible. But all that power comes at a cost, and with Android mobile phones, that cost comes in the form of battery consumption.</p>
<p>However, there are many ways to combat this, if you know what&rsquo;s sapping your power. So without further ado, here are our 10 top tips and tricks for increasing your Android phone&rsquo;s battery life!</p>
<p><em>Note: for demonstrative purposes, we&rsquo;ve used a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. Your interface may not look exactly alike, or offer the same precise options.</em></p>
<h2>1) Set screen brightness manually</h2>
<p>One of the most power-hungry features of any mobile phone is the display, especially if you&rsquo;ve got the brightness cranked up. The solution? Turn off auto-brightness, and then manually set the intensity to the lowest <em>comfortable</em> setting. That way, it&rsquo;s still visible, but considerably less demanding.</p>

<h2>2) Decrease the screen timeout period</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re glancing at your phone regularly to check the time or notifications, then another thing to do is set the screen timeout period (i.e. the length of time it takes for the screen to turn off again) to a low option, so that it doesn&rsquo;t draw power for longer than it needs to.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6838" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Screenshot_2013-02-10-00-45-27-576x1024.png" alt="Decrease the screen timeout period " width="300" height="533" /></p>
<h2>3) Switch to a static wallpaper</h2>
<p>Animated wallpapers are cool, but the thing is that they don&rsquo;t half use a lot of juice (not to mention processing power that would be better put to use elsewhere). Switch to a static image for your wallpaper, and you&rsquo;ll notice immediate improvements.</p>

<h2>4) Turn WiFi/data off when it&rsquo;s not needed</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re out and about, and you know you&rsquo;re not likely to connect to WiFi anytime soon, switch it off. It&rsquo;s draining battery unnecessarily. And if you&rsquo;re really struggling for charge, then you could go the extra mile and switch data off. Calls and texts will still make it through, but WhatsApp and other internet-based services won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>5) Keep the apps you use regularly up-to-date</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably noticed how frequently apps seem to update, but what you might not know is that the vast majority of updates are in the form of speed and power-usage improvements. So, if you have an app that you use a lot, keep it up-to-date to make sure it&rsquo;s running as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6841" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Screenshot_2015-05-21-10-12-41-576x1024.png" alt="Keep the apps you use regularly up-to-date" width="300" height="533" /></p>
<h2>6) Only let apps update manually</h2>
<p>Obviously when an app updates itself, your phone downloads heaps of information from the web, and that&rsquo;s costly on your battery life. So rather than giving apps the freedom to update when they like, do it yourself, manually, when you&rsquo;re near a power source.</p>

<h2>7) Kill background apps</h2>
<p>Besides the screen brightness and leaving data turned on all the time, the other big battery-eater is &ldquo;apps that you&rsquo;re not using, but that are running in the background anyway&rdquo;. Open up your running background apps and close them down. There are even some useful app-killers on Google Play.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6843" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Screenshot_2015-05-21-10-14-35-576x1024.png" alt="Kill background apps" width="300" height="533" /></p>
<h2>8) Turn vibrations off</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your phone on silent, you have to ask yourself whether setting the phone to vibrate is really worth it. After all, the little motor that makes it vibrate uses power, and unless your phone <em>is</em> on silent, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll hear it ring.</p>

<h2>9) Turn off location services</h2>
<p>We come to a tip that will also help with privacy concerns: location services. Sure, they&rsquo;re useful for finding local places and services, but with a combo of CellID and GPS, they use a surprising amount of juice. Turn them off until you need them, and your battery life can only get better!</p>

<h2>10) Enter Power Saving Mode</h2>
<p>When the going gets tough, some smartphones like Samsung Galaxy S6 and Sony Xperia Z3 have options like Power Saving Mode. By switching it on, functions like CPU performance, screen brightness, frame rate and screen timeout are all reduced. Then there&rsquo;s Ultra Power Saving Mode, which is even more extreme, switching your display to greyscale, restricting app usage and connectivity.</p>
