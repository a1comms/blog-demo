<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">New year, lots of new phones!</span></p>
<p>With 2017 finally upon us (hurrah!), there&rsquo;s probably just one thing on your mind. New year, new phone, am I right? If you&rsquo;re thinking of upgrading your current device in 2017 to get something a little more up-to-date, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>From the next Apple iPhone to a possible comeback from everyone&rsquo;s beloved Nokia, there&rsquo;s a whole host of smartphones hitting the stores this year. So <em>what are</em> the best new phones coming up in 2017? We take a look at just seven that you should get excited for!</p>
<h2>Upcoming Phones 2017 Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>LG G6</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 edge</li>
<li>HTC 11</li>
<li>Nokia P1</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 8</li>
<li>iPhone 8</li>
<li>Microsoft Surface Phone</li>
</ul>
<h2>LG G6</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date<strong>: </strong>February - April 2017</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12867" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-12867" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/lg-g6-leak.jpg" width="600" height="337" /> Leaked image courtesy of @OnLeaks[/caption]</p>
<p>First up, let&rsquo;s take a look at LG G6! Since LG G5 was announced in February last year and released by April, it would make sense that the brand&rsquo;s next flagship device would follow the same pattern. Still, some rumours suggest that we could have the smartphone as early as March.</p>
<p>Much like the recent Samsung Galaxy S-series phones, LG G6 will likely feature a VR-ready platform and a super-fast wireless charging system. The latter feature means that users will be able to charge their phones to 50% power in just 30 minutes. That&rsquo;s certain to come in handy whenever&nbsp;you forget to charge your phone overnight.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, like most of the Android phones on this list, LG G6 is set to have a state-of-the-art Snapdragon processor; the latest upgrade on the market. But unlike a lot of 2017 flagships, it&rsquo;s not likely to be getting rid of the headphone port just yet.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 edge</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date: February - April 2017</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypwZJ0rWHFU" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Since the Galaxy S8 and S8 edge are Samsung&rsquo;s next flagship phones, it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet that they&rsquo;ll be released early 2017. In recent years, the tech giant has announced its lead devices just a little before the Mobile World Congress, which starts on 27th February this year. Rumour has it that the Galaxy S8 and S8 edge will be unveiled around then, with a possible April release date.</p>
<p>So, what will the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 edge have to offer? Well, one of the most interesting rumours concerns their design. In fact, one recent leak suggested that both phones will sport curved displays, and an &lsquo;all-screen&rsquo; design, meaning the home button will be entirely digital.</p>
<p>According to yet another leak, both new Samsungs will run a 3.2GHz octa-core Snapdragon processor, resulting in extreme speed, blowing most of the market out of the water. Interestingly, the Galaxy S8 and S8 edge are rumoured to be following in iPhone 7&rsquo;s footsteps by ditching the headphone jack... Other rumoured features include a Samsung AI assistant (to rival Siri), a fingerprint and iris scanner, and dual speakers.</p>

<h2>HTC 11</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date<strong>: </strong>February - April 2017</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12868" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-12868 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/htc-11-leak.jpg" width="640" height="357" /> Leaked from a Chinese source on Weibo[/caption]</p>
<p>April will mark a year since the release of HTC 10, and so it&rsquo;s unlikely that the company will release its successor any later than that. In fact, HTC 11 may be released even earlier, with rumours that it&rsquo;s set for a grand unveiling at Mobile World Congress 2017.</p>
<p>HTC&rsquo;s upcoming smartphone is likely to take on a whole new look. A recent leak (see above) revealed a potential HTC 11 design with&nbsp;slick metal device and&nbsp;edge-to-edge screen. It could certainly be a head-turner.</p>
<p>HTC 11 will also likely run the same beastly Snapdragon processor as Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 edge. Plus, another source leaked some detailed stats on the phone, claiming it&rsquo;ll come with a huge 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage. However, it seems unlikely that HTC 11 will have <em>quite </em>so much RAM, given that the HTC 10 had a sufficient 4GB.</p>
<p>By far the most exciting rumour about this device is the possibility of a &lsquo;Sense Touch&rsquo; feature. This snazzy new function would supposedly allow users to control the device by simply tapping the metal along the edge of the phone. Oooh, futuristic!</p>

<h2>Nokia P1</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date: Early 2017</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12869" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/nokia-p1-leak.png" width="600" height="371" /></p>
<p>The very first Android devices from Nokia are set to hit the markets this year, which is rather intriguing news for old-school tech-lovers around the globe. Yes, the brand is waving one final goodbye to Microsoft Windows and bringing out a whole new type of smartphone. What&rsquo;s more, the new upcoming flagship, Nokia P1, might just be one of the best new phones of the year.</p>
<p>So, when can you get your hands on one of these devices? HMD Global (the company that owns Nokia) has confirmed that their latest line of smartphones will be available early this year. However, right now, we don&rsquo;t have an official release date.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole load of speculation about what the Nokia P1 will bring to the table. The display is certain to be one of its main draws, with rumours suggesting it will have a 2k resolution. In terms of design, a recently leaked mock-up shows a simplistic style with just a home button, which is likely to be available in a range of colours.</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 8</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date: August 2017</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12870" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/samsung-galaxy-note-8.jpg" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>After a rather, erm, <em>difficult</em> episode with the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung has a lot to prove with the potential release of a Galaxy Note 8 in 2017. Now, the company usually announce its Note devices in early August, and so it would make a lot of sense if Samsung followed suit this year. However, there&rsquo;s been a rumour circulating that the Note 8 will be fast-tracked for an earlier release date to make up for last year&rsquo;s, erm, <em>issues</em>.</p>
<p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure, if the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 really wants to compete with the best new phones out there; it has to be the most high-tech Samsung device yet. Early rumours suggest that it will boast a 5.7-inch Quad-HD Super AMOLED screen. It&rsquo;s also likely that it will have an ultra-fast processor and a whole load of RAM. After all, these two key elements will be integral if the company wants to continue down the VR route.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date: Mid-September 2017</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaucjPhgb7I" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, one of the most anticipated phones of the year is certain to be iPhone 8. It might not feel five minutes since iPhone 7 has hit stores, but later in 2017 there&rsquo;ll be a new device in town. Apple has a habit of releasing its new iPhones in September and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that this year will be any different.</p>
<p>So, what can the company do next? One of the most intriguing rumours is the death of the home button. Some leaks have suggested that iPhone 8 will not have the physical low-set home button we&rsquo;ve all come to know and love. Plus, while the phone is not likely to get any bigger, there are whispers of a larger screen coming our way (by eliminating the home button).</p>
<p>As far as design goes, some are claiming that it will look similar to iPhone 7, while others suggest that there may be a curved glass back. Only the powers at Apple know the truth. Other features may include wireless charging (which Apple has yet to release on an iPhone) and an iris scanner.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Surface Phone</h2>
<p>Rumoured release date: Late 2017</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLjmcPO4hVY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s well worth keeping your eye out for the Microsoft Surface Phone, as 2017 may be the year it actually comes to fruition. We first heard rumours about this device back in the dark ages (well, 2012 actually) and since then there has been a lot of talk about when it&rsquo;ll appear. The latest gossip is Microsoft Surface Phone will finally <em>surface</em> late this year.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, one of the biggest rumours about Microsoft Surface Phone is that it that it&rsquo;s not just one phone, but three. According to a recent leak, there will be a consumer, business, and pro version of the device. Apparently, the pro iteration will be a genuine alternative to a desktop computer, allowing you to boost your productivity on the go.</p>
<p>As for its specs, Microsoft Surface Phone is most likely to run (you guessed it!) a Snapdragon 835 and will also boast in the region of 6GB RAM. Aside from that, it will likely feature both a keyboard and a stylus, and may feature a built-in fingerprint scanner. Nice. While we can&rsquo;t be sure when the device will be announced, it&rsquo;s definitely worth keeping in mind if you&rsquo;re a Microsoft fan.</p>
