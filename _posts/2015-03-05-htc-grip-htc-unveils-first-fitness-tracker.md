<p><span class="postStandFirst">HTC has unveiled its first fitness tracker, HTC Grip, made in conjunction with fitness firm Under Armour. With GPS and a screen built in, will this fitness tracker have the chops to take on an already competitive market?</span></p>
<p><span class="postStandFirst"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6286" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/11034448_10153685060238084_954474536225804857_o.jpg" alt="HTC Grip &amp; HTC One M9" width="1024" height="512" /></span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that fitness trackers are the next big thing. Lots and lots of manufacturers are making their own wrist-mounted accessories, all of them designed to help you track and manage your exercise regimen, and now, it&rsquo;s the turn of smartphone-maker HTC.</p>
<p>Announced during MWC, and shown off via a release on <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/htc-unveils-htc-grip-serious-performance-for-serious-athletes-300043253.html">PR Newswire</a>, HTC Grip is the latest entry into this ultra-competitive market.</p>
<p>It is designed to sync up and work in conjunction with Under Armour&rsquo;s Record app, which is available on Google Play. That&rsquo;s intriguing, because it <em>implies</em> that the new HTC Grip will work with lots of other phones <em>besides</em> the newly-unveiled HTC One M9; whether it <em>will</em> be compatible with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S6 remains to be seen, but it&rsquo;s certainly a possibility.</p>
<p>Whichever phones it&rsquo;s compatible with, however, HTC Grip does have a selection of new features that should help it stand out in this competitive marketplace.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6288" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/03/10993107_10153684678168084_3927106565047055187_o-1024x835.jpg" alt="HTC Grip" width="960" height="782" /></p>
<p>The biggest addition is GPS, which lets you capture better location-data for your run, and allows you to more accurately manage your exercise regimen. Be aware, though, that using GPS on HTC Grip will affect the battery standby time, taking it from a stated two and a half days down to around five hours.</p>
<p>Another big addition that you just don&rsquo;t see on other fitness trackers is the curved P-OLED screen. This is a brilliant addition, as it not only allows you access to real-time stats on your run, but it can also allow HTC Grip to act as a watch, further increasing its usefulness!</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re still waiting to see information about when HTC Grip will reach the UK (at the moment, it&rsquo;s only slated for release in the USA, but we&rsquo;d bet that will change), so stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
