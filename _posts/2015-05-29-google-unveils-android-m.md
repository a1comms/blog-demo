<p><span class="postStandFirst">Google has unveiled the newest version of Android, called Android M (although what the &lsquo;M&rsquo; stands for is anyone&rsquo;s guess). With a nice selection of new features, this is the coolest version of Android yet...</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-6899 size-full aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/05/Android-KitKat-630x420.jpg" alt="Android-KitKat-630x420" width="630" height="420" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again; the Google I/O conference is now in full swing, and as in previous years, Google has taken to the stage to unveil the next iteration of its smartphone platform. Yes, it&rsquo;s time to say hello to Android M!</p>
<p>According to the search giant, the focus this time round has been on &ldquo;polish and quality&rdquo;, and as such, Google has &ldquo;literally solved thousands of bugs&rdquo;. However, there are also a few new features, which will undoubtedly make Android an even more compelling proposition.</p>
<p>The first is a feature called Doze, and with that, Android can use the sensors in your phone to smartly tell when it&rsquo;s not being used; that will lead to it using less power, and thus, not draining the battery in the phone as quickly. Combine that with support for USB Type-C cables (which allow for faster charging), and battery woes could soon be a thing of the past!</p>
<p>Next up is Android Pay, an NFC payment system which will allow you to pay for things with your phone. Android Pay will also use fingerprint authorisation for purchases, so if you have something like the Samsung Galaxy S6 (if it gets an update to Android M, and we&rsquo;d bet that it will), you get an extra layer of security.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the <em>big</em> change: Google has finally changed the way Android handles app permissions! Rather than dumping security info on you when you install an app, Android M breaks permissions down to tell you precisely what an app wants to do, as and when it tries to do it; presuming that it also allows you to deny individual permissions, this puts more control in users&rsquo; hands, and is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no firm release date for Android M, as yet (nor has Google said what the &lsquo;M&rsquo; stands for), so stay tuned for more news!</strong></p>
