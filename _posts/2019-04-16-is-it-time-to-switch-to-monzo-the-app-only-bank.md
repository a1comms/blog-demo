<p>It&rsquo;s the start of the new financial year and you may be wondering how you can buck up your spending habits. While banks can be a real drag, there&rsquo;s a modern alternative out there. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Monzo is a digital app-only bank that could offer you a whole load of budgeting and personal finance benefits. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Plan out Your Budget</h2>
<p>Few words strike fear into our hearts quite like &lsquo;budgeting&rsquo; does. The thought of setting yourself a spending limit could be enough to bring you out in cold sweats.</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However &ndash; as we all know too well &ndash; managing your money means knowing what you&rsquo;re spending, where you&rsquo;re spending it and why. Gah. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thankfully, this entire process is made rather easy with Monzo. You can set out a defined time period (say a month!) and decide how much you want to spend. It doesn&rsquo;t end there. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can also choose how much you want to spend on various things. For instance, you might want to set an &lsquo;eating out&rsquo; budget if you tend to overspend there. The app will let you know when you&rsquo;re nearing you limit so you can cool it until next month.</p>
<h2>Get Travel Money With Ease</h2>
<p>Planning a holiday sometime soon? Using Monzo abroad is extremely straightforward.</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to let the bank know before you jet off and you get the same exchange rate as you would with Mastercard. </p>

<p>You can also take up to &pound;200 worth of currency out of cash points abroad a month with no extra charges. (After that, there&rsquo;s a 3% withdrawal charge!)</p>
<h2>Send Cash to Your Friends Fast</h2>
<p>While most internet banking apps allow you to send money to your payees, few are as hassle-free as Monzo. The app imports your contact list which means that you can send cash to anybody so long as you have their phone number saved.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p>You can also send money to people who don&rsquo;t have the app, but you will need to put in their bank details. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Get Handy Notifications Too</h2>
<p>On the other hand, should a friend send you some cash, you will get a push notification on your smart device in an instant. That makes things like splitting a restaurant bill a whole load easier.</p>
<p>You will also get these notifications when you make any type of transaction as a little reminder of how and when you&rsquo;re spending money. Easy. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Make the Switch</h2>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many bells or whistles a new bank has, the thought of switching accounts can be daunting.</p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Luckily, swapping your current account over to Monzo can be pretty darn easy. The site has a dedicated <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://monzo.com/features/switch/" target="_blank">switch page</a> to help you along the way. All you have to do is tell them when you want to do it, wait seven business days and then you should be sorted. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The feature is also covered by the Current Account Switch Guarantee, which means that you don&rsquo;t have to stress about losing out.</p>
