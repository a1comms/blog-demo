<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Bigger means more powerful, right? Don&rsquo;t make iPhone SE laugh.</span></p>
<p>iPhone SE is more than just a smaller, more affordable iPhone. Apple engineered it with the very same innards as its flagship iPhone 6s, using the very same A9 chipset and M9 motion coprocessor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s significant because it means the 4-inch iPhone SE is <em>as</em> powerful as the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, despite its comparatively compact size. It&rsquo;s a pocket rocket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9968" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/iPhone-SE-power.jpg" alt="iPhone SE power" width="600" height="138" /></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.antutu.com/en/view.shtml?id=8200">AnTuTu&rsquo;s report</a> of the most powerful chipsets, Apple&rsquo;s A9 component ranks second in the list, beating all but the newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820.</p>
<p>So by that reasoning we can deduce that iPhone SE, which houses an Apple A9 chip, is faster than every smartphone on the market, excluding anything running on a Snapdragon 820.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9985" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/02095608-content.png" alt="AnTuTu&rsquo;s Report TOP-10 Performance Smartphone Chips" width="600" height="297" /></p>
<p>And how many handsets in the UK house a savage Snapdragon 820 processor? One. Making iPhone SE the joint second fastest mobile phone on our market (or, rather, <em>heading</em> to our market).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty impressive achievement for a handset so small and unassuming. You&rsquo;re not merely dealing with a rehashed iPhone 5s; this is an absolute powerhouse of a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re wondering what that <em>one</em> handset is. If I asked you to guess, I think you&rsquo;d suggest <a href="http://www.buymobiles.net/samsung/galaxy-s7-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Galaxy S7</a>. Whilst you&rsquo;d kind of be right, you&rsquo;d actually be totally wrong. Wait, what?</p>
<p>The UK variant of Samsung Galaxy S7 features the Exynos 8890, which places third in AnTuTu&rsquo;s list. Other markets, like Asia, however, have been blessed with Snapdragon 820-powered Galaxy S7s.</p>
<p>But, as I&rsquo;ve stated, there is one smartphone <em>here</em> in the UK that does boast the formidable Qualcomm chipset in question. And that&rsquo;s LG G5.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9986" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/lg-g5.png" alt="LG G5" width="600" height="498" /></p>
<p>Whilst LG G5 hasn&rsquo;t yet been released (launch is due for the start of April), it will technically be the most powerful smartphone once it hits the shelves, eclipsing everything including iPhone 6s, 6s Plus and SE.</p>
<p>Other than taking home gold for its processing performance, LG G5 is also the first modular smartphone, meaning you can slide new components in and out, like a camera grip or new battery. It&rsquo;s totally rad, and if that&rsquo;s not enough to make pre-order one, we don&rsquo;t what is.</p>
<p>And now for the boring bit&hellip; It&rsquo;s worth noting that AnTuTu&rsquo;s results are average scores, not the peak highest, and running results with mobile phones could fluctuate. And technically speaking, we&rsquo;ve drawn conclusions of iPhone SE&rsquo;s performance based on its components&rsquo; performance in an iPhone 6s.</p>
