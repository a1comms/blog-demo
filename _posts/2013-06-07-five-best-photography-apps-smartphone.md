<p><span class="postStandFirst">We give you the lowdown on our five favourite photography apps so you will never miss a Kodak moment again.</span></p>
<p>Smartphones have some very powerful imaging hardware, ranging from low-light cameras to full 13 megapixel snappers, and huge internal storage capabilities mean that we snap images like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. These apps are for those that want to get the best out of their pictures&nbsp;with minimal effort.</p>
