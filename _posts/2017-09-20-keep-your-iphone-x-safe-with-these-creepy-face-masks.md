<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Apparently these weird face masks will help protect your iPhone X&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Last week, we learned all about what Apple has in store for us in the coming months. Aside from the snazzy new <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-8-plus-64gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Plus</a> models, there&rsquo;s the flagship phone that everyone&rsquo;s talking about &mdash; <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a>!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14936" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_UBvRRgO6WLkTyUxDjr5CbdqUDpRgJgJpbMD_RZeSrurZRgZh4_E0_nN3ViFZGiAvNau7tDJ-yTGkiUgY8c6Dj4=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The high-tech device will be opened using a new feature called Face ID. That means that you simply look down at your device and it unlocks as if by magic. Your eyes need to be open for this to work and you need to have used the True Depth camera to memorise your face. The point is that no one else in the world should be able to unlock your <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a>, since no one has your exact face.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14990" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C9iJaKLpVyqrU273843gUc33f8HiDoxClaBWtD8xXoLv9Qw0zAciQUD8J_yyXg3J0PImgXAvAxWEH2xBO4AHW9_a=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>While many are psyched about the new security feature of <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/coming-soon/exciting-new-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a>, some are a little&hellip; well&hellip; nervous. What if someone uses your face to unlock your device while you&rsquo;re asleep?! (Note: As we already mentioned, your eyes need to be open for this to work, so this is <em>seriously </em>unlikely!) Still, the fact that this is a little far-fetched, hasn&rsquo;t stopped the warriors of the world from freaking out.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15006" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AK9ABQkGh_qPTHyjdMV8CiFs9hkQDL3r0wByVLA6p0HcyyU8D3ETQ65I9JLgzowgirAIfG0SJs4CxQLEQ-MGkzZN=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, companies are capitalising on people&rsquo;s fears and turning them into cold, hard cash. How? Well, with the invention of security sleeping masks for Apple users. Taobao online shopping site has started selling these masks in a broad array of variations.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14997" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZkJvYYuD9S7l-WGbpLLD2UaxWvENrbD4f4Vk6rWa33TtWHnu844cfDCi2qApc9VpAEeMta2DUeIFO_s9DPbmlRbV=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The basic eye mask does just what it says on the tin. (Spoiler: It covers your eyes while you sleep) However, if that level of protection just isn&rsquo;t enough for you, there&rsquo;s a mask that covers your entire head (minus the eyes and mouth). Oh, and finally, there&rsquo;s a mask that covers your head <em>and </em>your eyes and mouth. Because that&rsquo;s not creepy at all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14994 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/face-mask.png" alt="" width="640" height="388" /></p>
<p>If you do fancy getting a mask to wear over your head while you sleep (why?!), Taobao ships them to most countries around the globe and they come in a wide range of prices. The choice is yours and we totally won&rsquo;t judge you. Well, maybe just a little.</p>
