<p><span class="postStandFirst">When Google commissioned Asus to manufacture an Android tablet for it, no one knew what a sensation the Nexus 7 would become.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/4mOujeWhNLuQzUKsUvirur-SIEQkLmoB0aC81oEYbF7NMRqFm0xsKsvMXAIIvcbYK5w=w499" alt="" width="499" height="420" /></strong></p>
<p>Android may have ruled the smartphone platform for some time but, even though many manufacturers tried to crack the tablet market none of the Android tablets were able to de-throne the mighty Apple iPad.</p>
<p>Enter the&nbsp;Nexus 7. A 7-inch slate with a powerful processor, HD screen, Near Field Communication (NFC) and stock Android operating system. The Nexus 7 was the first tablet of its kind to offer great value for money by under-cutting the iPad and offering more advanced technology in a beautiful and compact body.</p>
<p>As ever, one of the biggest draws to Nexus devices is the inclusion of stock Android, the latest and untouched version of the platform. The Nexus 7 is no different and ships with the most current Android incarnation, known as Jelly bean 4.2, which offers multi-user accounts, a better notification area, lock-screen windows and Google Now.</p>
<p>The device itself is slim, compact and weighs just 340g making the tablet very portable. It is powered by a quad-core Tegra 3 chipset which runs at 1.2GHz and is backed by 1GB of RAM meaning the Nexus 7 is one of the fastest tablets around.</p>
<p>The screen on the Nexus is wonderful to view, offering crisp and vibrant colours and great viewing angles which is ideal for watching movies, reading e-books or simply surfing the web.</p>
<p><strong>A beautiful device, which houses some great technology, a stunning and practical design and the latest version of Android, the Nexus 7 is quite simply one of the best tablets money can buy.</strong></p>
