<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The next Samsung Galaxy smartphone could be out of this world!</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again, where we look ahead to what our friends at Samsung could be bringing us in 2019.</p>
<p>Part of that are the rumours circulating around the potential Galaxy S10 and what amazing new and shiny features it will have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rounded up all the latest rumours from across the web, so you can get fully up to date on the Galaxy S10 headlines. But before all that, here's a video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC09L_iJkMVxabXrPz4I0sSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concept Creator</a>&nbsp;on how the next Galaxy smartphone could turn out.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eoj7WMX1k6w" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Pretty nice, right?</p>
<h2>Will We See a Name Change?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a betting kinda guy, you&rsquo;d probably put your money on the next flagship handsets being called the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus, or even Galaxy X.</p>
<p>Trusted Reviews seems to think Samsung might do what Apple did last year and launch a special edition Galaxy S handset on its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. But that for now, will remain as speculation.</p>
<h2>S10 Design and Display Rumours</h2>
<p>Could it be time for a <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-might-have-three-screens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foldable display</a>? There&rsquo;s a suggestion that a Galaxy X handset could have this feature. How would you feel about a foldable screen? Could be pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>According to sources cited by Trusted Reviews, the Galaxy S10 will measure in at 5.8 inches, the larger Galaxy S10 Plus will be getting a 6.3-inch display. That will make sure they measure up against the competition. However, you&rsquo;d only be getting 0.1-inch more on the S10 Plus than you would over the S9 Plus.</p>

<h2>S10 Camera Rumours</h2>
<p>This is the fun part, and with rumours circulating around a potential triple camera, you&rsquo;d be silly not to get excited. This would certainly bring the new devices on par with the now famous <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P20 Pro</a> and its triple camera set-up.</p>
<p>According to Android Authority, there might also be a 3D camera sensor, and some potential AR capability in the next Samsung camera.</p>
<p>With stiff competition from the likes of the <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/huawei/p20-pro-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei P20 Pro</a> and iPhone X, Samsung may step up its game in the camera department this time around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17642" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PF-COM5nynqrvOL5aF1t4QTgeLCe9ejCTyLEiVrASBGxeBQ7t88SmsPk89QBin7BtoozOqj2PUvKKvxf2F6pgYMe=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of chatter about new fingerprint sensor technology too. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-triple-camera-872169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Authority</a> claims that an in-display fingerprint sensor will make an appearance on the new Galaxy S10 range. This would again, be a pretty big standout feature for Samsung.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some claims from <a href="https://www.t3.com/features/samsung-galaxy-s10-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T3</a> that the new Galaxy range with be 5G ready. This would make the handsets future proof and put them right up there as one of the first 5G ready devices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt the latest Samsung devices will be sporting the newest Android tech too, which promises lots of <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/rumours/android-p-rumours-name-features-and-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">innovative and exciting features</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17641" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7E0Bkf_rcYtRmcvXKm4P84H0nnKiOzDgVV9MLk7d9pxmAVreitYPdzX5jRJPXJ7An1Z21QI9VnHbCblJIWfKlxwYxg=s0" alt="" /></p>
<h2>S10 Price</h2>
<p>As always, all the new stuff will come at a price. <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s10-release-date-specs-rumours-3456012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trusted Reviews</a> expects a base RRP of up to &pound;799 for the Galaxy S10 and &pound;899 for the Galaxy S10 Plus. This would make both models more expensive than the S9 and S9 Plus variants.</p>
<h2>S10 Release Date</h2>
<p>Although we can only speculate at this stage, Samsung has kept a tradition of launching its flagship phones around February. So, its likely that we'll see the S10 in the first quarter of 2019. This is usually around the time of the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, so be sure to keep an ear out for that one.</p>
