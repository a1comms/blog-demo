<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony's latest release in the Z series is the Sony Xperia Z3 - a slicker, more stylish and slimmer version of the previous iteration, packed with updated features to boot!</span></p>
<p>You'll find the same fantastic 20.7 megapixel camera, which has become the standard in a Sony flagship smartphone, and boasts a new 25mm G Lens and ISO 12800 sensitivity, for even better photos in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Unique power-saving technology ensures that you can work, rest and play without the fear that your handset will run dry, and IP65/68 certification is now the highest water and dust proof rating found on a smartphone!</p>
<p>Of course, there's more and, with the help of a filthy canal, a pint or two and a mash-up of nineties film Trainspotting, we've produced a video review for you. So we'll stop waffling on about this superior device and let you watch, learn and enjoy!</p>
