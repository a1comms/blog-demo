<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">The Trump-Twitter saga continues. And apparently, world leaders have special status on the platform too!</span></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here. Donald Trump has been known to tweet some pretty heavy and controversial things in his time. Take last Tuesday for example, when he stated that his nuclear button was &lsquo;much bigger&rsquo; and &lsquo;more powerful&rsquo; than that of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the &ldquo;Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.&rdquo; Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tweets like this that has led to some Twitter users speaking out and suggesting that Trump should be banned from the platform.</p>
<p>Other tweeters claim that it's these type of statements (with a side helping of potential nuclear war) that actually violate Twitter's ban on threats of violence and could put us all in danger.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter needs to block Donald Trump's account immediately.</p>

<p>However, despite an outcry for the president&rsquo;s account to be suspended, the social media platform will not be doing anything about it. The reason, according to a recent post by the social media giant, is that world leaders have a special status on the site, i.e. they are above the general rules that the rest of us must follow.</p>
<p>The folks over at Twitter recently explained via a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2017/world-leaders-and-twitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on its corporate site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Twitter said that it does review tweets by world leaders and enforce some rules, it said that blocking Trump is not on the agenda.</p>
<p>The site&rsquo;s officials had previously stated that whether or not a tweet is &lsquo;of public interest&rsquo; is taken into account when deciding whether to ban a user. Since what the president of the US has to say is very much that, it&rsquo;s clear to see why the site would not want to block him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16197" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5jm20GJOIBOUGJnJOS2a0HTODzwimHtsgZPBou5__5mG14_6fVdFfKf65G0ii9yoLgoXUzAzzdt5sFe13JNIy0-b=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>"No one person's account drives Twitter's growth, or influences these decisions," the company said in the post. "We work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind."</p>
<p>Despite the explanation, users have responded negatively to the post on Twitter. In fact, many have been expressing nothing short of anger at the decision to allow Trump to remain an active user on the site.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Twitter,<br />
Since you have made it clear you will never block Trump because he is so &ldquo;important&rdquo; we believe what WE have to say is equally important. If he can post abusive and offensive tweets at ALL of us, we should never get blocked for doing the same!<br />
Sincerely, America</p>
