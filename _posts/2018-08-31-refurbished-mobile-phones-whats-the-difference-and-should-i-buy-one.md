<h2>Why Should You Get a Refurbished Phone?</h2>
<p>Of course, it goes without saying that the biggest reason to get a refurbished phone is to save some pennies (yes!). When you&rsquo;re on a budget, opting for a brand-new flagship device may be out of your price range. Luckily, there are options.</p>
<p>Here are three simple reasons why getting a refurbished phone is a smart way to go.</p>
<h5>Better Price</h5>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting a refurbished phone, you could get a real bargain. These devices are typically even more affordable than new ones. With that in mind, it does pay off to look around and see what you can find. At <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buymobiles</a>.net, there are a range of refurbished iPhone models to get you started.</p>
<h5>They&rsquo;re Nearly New</h5>
<p>But wait, what about the condition of the refurbished phone? Don&rsquo;t panic. When you buy a refurbished product from Buymobiles.net, you can be certain that you&rsquo;re getting a high-end, Grade-A device. Each phone is nearly new and in top-notch condition.</p>

<h5>Warranty Ready</h5>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re getting a standard refurbished phone or a CPO product (hold on, we&rsquo;ll explain these terms in a minute!), there&rsquo;s one thing you know for sure. You get peace of mind. Each type of device comes with a minimum warranty period of 6 months. That means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about anything going wrong with it.</p>
<h2>What Types of Refurbished Phones Are There?</h2>
<p>So, are you considering getting a refurbished phone? One of the most popular refurbs happens to be iPhone. From iPhone 6s all the way up to iPhone X, Buymobiles.net stocks a broad range of options.</p>
<p>However, when you first start looking, you might find all the terms a little baffling. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h5>Refurbished iPhones</h5>
<p>At Buy Mobiles, a &ldquo;refurbished iPhone&rdquo; comes complete with at least six months left on its Apple warranty. Each of iPhone is tested and verified by experts to ensure that they are of the highest standards, and the software is spotless.</p>
<p>While you may see some subtle signs of use, these phones are in excellent physical condition too. They don&rsquo;t come with earphones but do come with the complete Lightning to USB charger. Choosing a refurbished phone from Buymobiles.net means that you get quality tech at a reasonable price.</p>
<h5>CPO Refurbished iPhones</h5>
<p>You might have heard about &lsquo;CPO refurbished&rsquo; iPhone devices, but what does it actually mean?</p>
<p>That little acronym stands for Certified Pre-Owned, and tells you that iPhone units have come directly from Apple =, where they&rsquo;ve been officially tested and certified.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18492" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W2ZqCrQ7H3lseQtjR9q-tqLUHTBUqJB-QyGXRzXJ7SNuHjhDgqZFFVejW-rVo6ZfF5Jc7zQ2Q7AQnB9JElPm8sK8=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>They come in pristine condition, which means that you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference between a brand-new one and the refurb.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, CPO iPhone models come with a full year warranty from Apple as well as a new box, accessories, and even a new battery. The long and the short of it is that it&rsquo;s the next best thing to getting a new phone, but will save you some money along the way.</p>
