<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">A security firm has issued global warnings that a dangerous new virus called Mazar, capable of wiping all data from your handset, is being spread across Android smartphones worldwide.</span></p>
<p>The malware, known as &lsquo;Mazar&rsquo;, gains admin rights to your phone meaning it is capable of remotely wiping all your content, making calls on your behalf and even reading your text and instant messages.</p>
<p>The virus was first detected by Heimdal, a security firm based in Denmark, who believe that the malicious Mazar has already infected 100,000 smartphones and could be spreading to other countries at a rate of knots!</p>
<p>Transmitted via text, Mazar disguises itself as a multimedia message with a link that downloads the dangerous software once opened. It will then continuously download through the infected software it has installed on your handset, meaning attackers can monitor all your smartphone activity remotely, erase data and even make calls and send texts.</p>
<p>This news comes after a University of Cambridge study highlighted the fact that 85% of UK smartphones would face an attack of this nature due to security vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Protect yourself from infection:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Never open a text or message from an unrecognised number/user<br />
&bull; Never click on a link within a text message unless you are sure you know and trust the sender<br />
&bull; Install security software on your device, such as McAfee Pro<br />
&bull; Report any unusual text activity to your network provider</p>
