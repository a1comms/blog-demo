<p>Modern technology is a glorious thing. Whenever a question springs to mind, your AI is there to give you a super-fast answer and no back-chat.</p>
<p>Yes, Siri is a serious know-it-all that&rsquo;s locked inside your iPhone.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve just got a brand-new phone and want to get chummy with your new (artificial) bestie, here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<h2>How to Use Siri on iPhone 6s (and Newer Generations)</h2>
<p>If you have an <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/apple/iphone-6s-32gb-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 6s</a> or a later generation iPhone, using Siri couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Simply hold down the &lsquo;Home&rsquo; button on the front of the device and ask the assistant any question that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of iPhone that you have, you may find that you have to wait until you see the Siri screen before posing your question.</p>

<h2>How to Use Siri on iPhone X</h2>
<p>With the latest iPhone X, things have changed just a little. Don&rsquo;t panic, though, because using Siri is as simple as ever.</p>
<p>Rather than holding the &lsquo;Home&rsquo; button, you need to press the &lsquo;Side&rsquo; button while asking your question. Other than that, you&rsquo;ll find that Siri works in much the same way as always. Give it a go!</p>
<h2>Unlock the &lsquo;Hey Siri&rsquo; Command</h2>
<p>The year is 2018 and we no longer need to bother with buttons, am I right? If you&rsquo;d prefer to go all space-aged about things, you might want to unlock the &lsquo;Hey Siri&rsquo; command on your iPhone. To do so, go to Settings > Siri &amp; Search > Listen for "Hey Siri."</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve switched this feature on, you&rsquo;ll no longer have to hold a button to ask a question. Instead, your iPhone will always be listening out for the &lsquo;Hey Siri&rsquo; command. When you say it aloud, the assistant will start up and help with any query you have. This is a great little party trick as it means that you can talk to your iPhone and make it do things without having to lift a finger. Win.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you have a device older than iPhone 6s, you have to plug your phone into a power source before you can use the &lsquo;Hey Siri&rsquo; feature. Sorry, guys! </em></p>
<h2>Bonus: Have Some Fun with Siri</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the basics down, it&rsquo;s time to have some fun with Apple&rsquo;s personal assistant.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things that you can do with Siri is have it announce your calls as they come in. To unlock this feature, you just need to head to Settings > Phone > Announce Calls and switch it on. Simple.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can change Siri&rsquo;s gender and accent? Head to Settings > Siri &amp; Search > Siri Voice. Personally, I&rsquo;ve opted for an Aussie guy, but you can go ahead and make your own mind up on this one&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally, you might also want to bamboozle the AI with some tricky, funny, or just plain random questions. Check out some of the <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/the-20-best-questions-to-ask-siri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best questions to ask Siri</a> and give it a go for yourself. From the meaning of life to questions about the universe, this assistant has all the answers&hellip; and when it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s ready with a quick-witted reply.</p>
