<p><span class="postStandFirst">Samsung has hit back at reports that Samsung Galaxy S6 will bend when pressure is applied to it, with a YouTube video showing the company&rsquo;s own bend tests.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6482 size-full" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/04/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-Bendgate.png" alt="Samsung Galaxy S6 Bendgate" width="850" height="467" /></p>
<p>When iPhone 6 first went on sale, one of the big stories around the time was something known as &ldquo;Bendgate&rdquo;, a supposed issue (now basically debunked) which saw it bending when subjected to the kind of forces that would come from being kept in a person&rsquo;s back pocket.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> issue has been proven false, it&rsquo;s time for Samsung to face a similar situation, after testing company SquareTrade has shown videos of the Korean manufacturer&rsquo;s two flagship phones doing the exact same thing (according to the testers, the phones break when a pressure of 110lbf is applied).</p>
<p>So, naturally, Samsung has hit back with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKburDQAolA">a video on YouTube</a>, showing its <em>own </em>bend tests being done on both Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge.</p>
<p>According to Samsung, there were two problems with the initial test done by SquareTrade: the phone used was tested <em>without</em> its backplate on (the backplate adds extra support and rigidity), and more force was applied to the phone than it was ever likely to be subjected to in real world usage.</p>
<p>Several commentators have pointed out that it seems strange to test a phone without its backplate, since it&rsquo;s incredibly unlikely to end up in that state in the real world, and Samsung&rsquo;s own test shows that both phones can withstand 80lbf of pressure.</p>

<p><strong><br />
It remains to be seen whether Samsung&rsquo;s own Bendgate will become an issue, although based on what happened with iPhone 6, it does seem unlikely. And as in that situation, the advice from pretty much everyone remains the same: don&rsquo;t sit on your phone, then you won&rsquo;t bend it! </strong></p>
