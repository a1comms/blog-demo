<p><span class="postStandFirst">Sony makes one of the best smartphones in the world right now, in the the Sony Xperia Z2. One of its key features is certainly its camera, which can now record video in the new 4K resolution.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/12972354304_c258f0a7fd.jpg" width="500" height="297" /></p>
<p>While many people have said that is overkill, Sony&rsquo;s Kichiro Kurozumi has gone on record to explain why a 4K camera is actually a very good thing, even if the resulting video isn&rsquo;t going to be seen on 4K displays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's no dependency on 4K TVs. [Video] will look best on those, but even when downscaled to 1080p, the higher-resolution video looks good &ndash; better than simply recording in 1080p,&rdquo; said Kumozuri, when asked whether there was any point in recording 4K video when only a handful of people have 4K displays.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s more to the 4K camera than just the higher-resolution video it produces. That increase in resolution also brings an unexpected side benefit: Kuzomuri says that with more pixels to play around with, the image stabilisation in the&nbsp;Sony Xperia Z2&nbsp;can compensate for up to 21% more movement than rivals like, for example, the iPhone 5s or the upcoming&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S5, while recording video.</p>
<p>It also helps to produce better low-light videos, which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>And so, while we already new that the camera in the Sony Xperia Z2 takes superb photos, it now turns out that it produces top-notch videos, as well. For capturing those magic moments, in moving pictures, it may end up proving to be the best phone on the market!</strong></p>
