<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Ah, the memories...</span></p>
<p>Apple fanboys will remember October 2001 all too fondly. It was, of course, the year Apple released the first ever iPod.</p>
<p>The original generation might seem pretty basic compared to today&rsquo;s uber-advanced iPod touch, but it was <em>the</em> game-changer in the MP3 player sphere. The slick design and easy-to-use functions made the gadget one of the most desirable must-haves of the early 2000s, combined with funky ad campaigns, they were just about the coolest product around.</p>

<p>To celebrate its 15-year anniversary, we&rsquo;re going to take you through a visual, nostalgia-filled tour of iPod through its best generations. Starting, unsurprisingly, at the beginning...</p>
<h2>2001 &ndash; iPod, First Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12046" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-1st-gen.jpg" alt="ipod-1st-gen" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>With just 5GB of storage and a rotating scrolling wheel, this will look positively stone-age to kids today. Indeed, the original iPod is a far cry from the colourful little gadgets currently available from Apple, but it wasn&rsquo;t long until Apple released a second generation iPod, which came complete with a touch scrolling wheel. Fancy.</p>
<h2>2003 &ndash; iPod, Third Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12047" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-3rd-gen.png" alt="ipod-3rd-gen" width="269" height="450" /></p>
<p>While the third generation iPod had the touch scrolling wheel, one of Apple&rsquo;s signature design features, it lacked much in the way of Apple&rsquo;s trademark minimalism. With four extra buttons adorning the bottom of the screen, this was an uncharacteristically messy style&hellip; Bad Apple, bad!</p>
<h2>2004 - iPod Mini, First Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12048" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-mini-1st-gen.png" alt="ipod-mini-1st-gen" width="600" height="224" /></p>
<p>The iPod Mini saw the first click wheel, something that we all became familiar with over the years. While this tiny version of the gadget <em>did </em>have less storage than users were used to, the style was undeniably enhanced. What&rsquo;s more, the Mini came in an array of pretty colours that teen users were obsessed with!</p>
<h2>2004 &ndash; iPod, Fourth Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12049" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-4th-gen.jpg" alt="ipod-4th-gen" width="482" height="450" /></p>
<p>Probably the most famous iPod design <em>ever</em>, the fourth generation gadget will forever remain the key product in Apple&rsquo;s history. The sleek white plastic design, complete with a click wheel and a small black and white screen, is probably the one everyone thinks back to as the iconic iPod.</p>
<h2>2005 - iPod Shuffle, First Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12050" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/iPodShuffle1st.jpg" alt="ipodshuffle1st" width="450" height="450" /></p>
<p>The iPod Shuffle was not much to shout about when it was first released. The plain white gadget looked like a flash drive and had limited storage. However, it cost far less than its expensive sister products and was the first iPod ever to use flash memory. It&rsquo;s compact size made it a favourite amongst runners and other sporty users.</p>
<h2>2005 - iPod Nano, First Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12051" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-nano-1st.jpg" alt="ipod-nano-1st" width="464" height="450" /></p>
<p>At just 0.3 inches thick, iPod Nano was a revelation when it first hit UK stores. This was a gadget that changed the iPod history, offering a decent amount of storage in a tiny, little box. What more could you possibly want?</p>
<h2>2005 &ndash; iPod, Fifth Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12052" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-5th-gen.png" alt="ipod-5th-gen" width="533" height="450" /></p>
<p>Just four years after the initial release of the iPod, Apple managed to completely change the way in which people listened (and bought) music. The fifth generation iPod came complete with a large colour screen, video options and, later, movies that you could download from iTunes. Your MP3 player just became your MP4 player.</p>

<h2>2007 - iPod Touch, First Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12053" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-touch-1st-gen.png" alt="ipod-touch-1st-gen" width="242" height="450" /></p>
<p>The iPod Touch was a step away from the iPod designs that we were familiar with. Instead, this version of the gadget looked more akin to the iPhone (which was released shortly before it) than to any previous generation of iPod. With a full size colour touchscreen and apps aplenty, this was a whole different experience.</p>
<h2>2007 - iPod Classic</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12054" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-classic-6th-gen.jpg" alt="ipod-classic-6th-gen" width="338" height="450" /></p>
<p>In 2007, we were all feeling a little nostalgic about the way things once were. That&rsquo;s probably why Apple went ahead and released the iPod Classic. The design was strikingly similar to the 2005 version of the gadget, but included a few major differences. Boasting a massive 160GB memory, this would be the iPod with the biggest capacity ever. Impressive, even by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<h2>2009 - iPod Nano, Fifth Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12055" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-nano-5th.jpg" alt="ipod-nano-5th" width="600" height="380" /></p>
<p>While this was happening, Apple were also playing around with the great many features that the Nano had to offer. By the fifth generation of iPod Nano, there was even a built-in camera and a loudspeaker to boot.</p>
<h2>2010 - iPod Shuffle, Fourth Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12056" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-shuffle-4th-gen-mid2015.png" alt="ipod-shuffle-4th-gen-mid2015" width="514" height="280" />Ideal for runners and the like, the fourth generation iPod Shuffle boasted few buttons and a handy clip so you could literally wear the device. In a range of bright colours, the low-cost gadget was a massive hit.</p>
<h2>2012 - iPod Nano, Seventh Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12057" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-nano-7th-gen-mid2015.png" alt="ipod-nano-7th-gen-mid2015" width="413" height="450" /></p>
<p>Basically, the seventh generation iPod Nano is a mini version of the iPod Touch. With just one home button and a full touch screen, the gadget is easy-to-use and offers many fun features.</p>
<h2>2015 - iPod Touch, Sixth Generation</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12058" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/10/ipod-touch-6th-gen.png" alt="ipod-touch-6th-gen" width="428" height="450" /></p>
<p>Finally, last year, Apple released the latest sixth generation of the iPod Touch. The gadget keeps many features from the original design but now comes in a fabulous colourful aluminium design. What&rsquo;s more, it uses an A8 chip; the same processor used by the iPhone 6. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree, it&rsquo;s a world away from the initial 2001 product.</p>
