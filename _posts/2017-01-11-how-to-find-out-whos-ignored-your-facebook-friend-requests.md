<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">I&rsquo;m not hurt. Honestly.</span></p>
<p>Since social media is such a massive part of our lives, what you do online really does impact things IRL (in real life).</p>
<p>For example, if you unfriend someone on Facebook, you can all but guarantee that they&rsquo;ll have a meltdown the moment they realise. Why? Well, because it&rsquo;s a massive social insult; one of the biggest you can commit in the social media age.</p>
<p>Still, what if things don&rsquo;t even get that far, eh? What if you send out a friend request to an old pal from school, or perhaps someone in the office, and they just straight-up ignore you. I don&rsquo;t want to shock you but it could happen. In fact, it probably already has.</p>

<p>You might not even know about it. Most of the time when someone commits this social sin, we forget about it altogether. After all, it doesn&rsquo;t show up as a notification when someone hits that oh-so-hurtful &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; button on us, so how would we know?</p>
<h2>Locate (and Destroy) People Who&rsquo;ve Ignored You</h2>
<p>Despite you never being notified that your friend request has been totally ignored, there is a way to find out. <em>(Warning: This could open up a whole can of worms when you see just who has decided you&rsquo;re unworthy of them!) </em>Here&rsquo;s how to see who&rsquo;s ignored your Facebook friend requests&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to find out the truth once and for all, it&rsquo;s surprisingly simple. First you need to click on the <strong>Friend Reques</strong><strong>t</strong> symbol (the one that looks like two little figures) at the top of your Facebook page. Then go to <strong>View all</strong> at the bottom of the drop-down list.</p>
<p>Beneath your friend requests (or, in my case, lack thereof), there&rsquo;ll be a link that reads <strong>View Sent Requests</strong>. Click that and you should see all the requests you&rsquo;ve sent which have, sadly, been ignored.</p>

<h2>Save Some Dignity</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve discovered the culprits too cool to accept your reach out for friendship, there&rsquo;s something you ought to do to save yourself any further embarrassment, and claim back some dignity. Even if it&rsquo;s just a shred.</p>
<p>Cancel your pending friend requests and pretend you never sent them. That way, if the recipients check their requests again, yours will have already disappeared into the darkest corners of the web, never to be heard of or spoken about again.</p>
<p>To remove your requests, hover over the <strong>Friend Request Sent</strong> box next to their name. A drop-down menu will appear; you just need to select the <strong>Cancel Request</strong> option. Voila! Social shame avoided.</p>
