<p><span class="postStandFirst">With the news that BT is interested in buying the two biggest networks in the UK (EE and O2), we take a look at the history of those two networks, to see why BT wants to make this move (hint: they&rsquo;re the two biggest networks in the UK), and put the whole discussion into some kind of context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6049" alt="BT" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/BT_0-1024x485.jpg" width="576" height="272" /></p>
<p>The big news of the week, so far, is BT wants back in on the mobile world; what began as a rumour has been confirmed as fact, with BT in talks with both O2 <i>and</i> EE, with a view to buying one or the other (or possibly both, although it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how that wouldn&rsquo;t fall foul of EU monopoly laws).</p>
<p>To better understand why BT is wanting to make this move, we need to take a look at the history of the mobile world, so we can put everything into context...</p>
<h2>The History Of O2</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been watching the mobile world for a while, you&rsquo;ll know that O2 wasn&rsquo;t <i>always</i> O2. As things stand right now, O2 is owned by Spanish communications giant Telef&oacute;nica, but before <i>that</i> company took over the reins in 2005, O2 (which took up that brand identity in 2002) was owned by a holding company called mmO2 PLC.</p>
<p>And what was O2 before it was named O2? Simple, it was BT Cellnet!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6050" alt="bt_cellnet" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/bt_cellnet.png" width="465" height="157" /></p>
<p>Yes, this is why BT&rsquo;s plans to buy out O2 from Telef&oacute;nica do actually make sense to anyone who was around in the industry at the time, because originally <i>was</i> part of BT, fully owned by the British comms giant from 1999 to 2002 under the remit of the BT Wireless group. Along with Vodafone, BT Cellnet (then just called Cellnet) can be traced back through history to the 80s, making it one of the earliest mobile networks in the UK, and thus, pioneers (and fun fact: BT Cellnet also pioneered mobile data, being the first network to offer GPRS in the UK).</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, once again, and we now find that O2 is the second biggest mobile network in the country, but there&rsquo;s one network that&rsquo;s bigger...</p>
<h2>The History Of EE</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6051" alt="EE" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/11/cKYnP1ZDizeo6ShHF6u5Tx82jRtuo7zjn1B_vxIZU30RmLoRxEaAzzVhuauJZP1PuAw300.png" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>That network is, of course, EE, and it became the biggest UK network by dint of the fact that EE is actually <i>two</i> networks in one.</p>
<p>EE was formed by the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, although the merger took 4 years to actually go through (it was announced in 2008, with the new EE service being actually switched on in 2012). Before that, each individual network had been going for a long time, with Orange trading under that name since 1994, and T-Mobile trading under <i>that</i> name since 2002; T-Mobile came about after a name-change for the network that preceded it, One2One. <i>That</i> network launched in 1993 and was the world&rsquo;s first GSM1800 network, as opposed to GSM900 networks O2 and Vodafone.</p>
<p>We also have to say this: considering that One2One used to be known, somewhat cruelly, as One2No-One (based on how rubbish their signal was back in the mists of prehistory), it&rsquo;s both awesome and not a little uplifting to see that they&rsquo;re now part of the biggest network in the country. It&rsquo;s a true underdog success story!</p>
<h2>The Future Of Both?</h2>
<p>So, that brings us up to date, and we need to ask the big questions: will these buyouts go through, and if they do, how will it affect us all as customers?</p>
<p>Of the two, the O2 deal seems the more likely to go ahead, since the actual price is now public knowledge (BT want to buy O2 for &pound;10billion). The EE deal, meanwhile, is in the form of &ldquo;early exploratory discussion&rdquo;, so there&rsquo;s no guarantee that one will come to fruition. If it did, though (especially if BT buys O2 first), many people have pointed out that it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed to fall foul of monopoly laws; a company buying the two biggest networks in the country is, according to many, simply not cricket!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many people would have a problem with BT taking over the running of their phones, after some behaviour in the past which has been interpreted by many as deeply anti-consumer (the biggest example being the Phorm scandal of 2008).</p>
<p><strong>Whatever happens now, though, one thing is for sure: the future is going to get very interesting indeed. Stay tuned, because we&rsquo;ll be watching this one like a hawk... </strong></p>
