<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Redheads will finally get the equality they deserve!</span></p>
<p>For as long as any of us can remember, there has been playground prejudice against auburn-haired individuals. It may have been something that was simply shrugged off, or even laughed at in the past, but it&rsquo;s a real issue. And now, the redheaded nation is speaking up about it!</p>
<p>This type of gingerism (yes, that totally is a word) is never more evident than in the technological sphere. If you take a look at standard emojis, you&rsquo;ll notice an array of hair and skin colours that mirror life&rsquo;s beautiful diversity. But not all of it. The hair colour that always seems to be overlooked is, of course, red hair.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_12994" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full wp-image-12994" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/01/no-ginger-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="255" /> Not a ginger in sight![/caption]</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the likes of Apple and other tech developers around the globe have started to diversify their range of emojis. From introducing more skin tones to creating both male and female emojis to symbolise certain jobs, they've been striving to create a more representative emoji-world. Still, the work isn't over yet.</p>
<p>A campaign to get redhaired emojis introduced to the market has been bubbling in the background for some time. In fact, a Change.org petition was set up over two years ago, asking the likes of Apple and Unicode Consortium to create more diversity in the hair department of their emojis. The petition did not go unnoticed and now has more than 21,000 supporters.</p>
<p>>> Want to sign the ginger emoji peition?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the <a href="http://blog.emojipedia.org/redhead-emoji-update/">Emojipedia</a> blog reports that a proposal has been made to the Emoji Subcommittee, with a few ideas of how the whole ginger emoji thing might actually work. It all sounds very complicated right now, but it looks like the campaign is really taking hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lack of a redhead emoji has been the most frequent complaint from Emojipedia users in the past three months,&rdquo; explains Jeremy Burge, on Emojipedia. &ldquo;This document aims to move the discussion forward on how this can be addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full petition actually goes into detail about which current emojis could also come with redhair. From the standard man and woman emojis to the facepalm and dancer emojis, the document claims that a whole load of these little icons could benefit from a good old dose of the ginger. And, why on earth not?!</p>

<p>So, when will we see emojis boasting auburn locks? Well, that all depends on Unicode Consortium (the company that creates emojis for companies like Apple). If they decide to go ahead with the carrot-topped icons, they could be a reality.</p>
<p>However, Unicode Consortium is just months away from releasing its next enoji line-up. What that means is that we&rsquo;re unlikely to see redheads make it into the next instalment. Instead, we&rsquo;ll probably have to wait until 2018, if we see them at all. Sigh!</p>
