<p><span class="postStandFirst">After months of rumours, it&rsquo;s finally here: the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus is official! Join us as awe take a quick look at all the new stuff.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through all the rumours, we&rsquo;ve been teased for weeks, and now, it&rsquo;s finally time to clap eyes on the genuine article itself. Yes, Samsung Unpacked is in full swing, and that can mean only one thing.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus has been officially unveiled!</p>
<p>And so, we finally get to see how accurate the rumours were. We&rsquo;ll start with the look of the phone and, more importantly, the screen, since that&rsquo;s the bit denoted by the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; in the name (thanks to being curved round the edges of the phone).</p>
<p>As the rumours suggested, it&rsquo;s a 5.7-inch screen (that&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;Plus&rdquo; part of the name comes in), and it shares the same Quad-HD resolution as the current Samsung Galaxy S6 edge.</p>
<p>Oh, and those curved edges serve a purpose, too, offering new ways to interact with your apps and contacts, like People Edge (plus, Samsung will be releasing an API to let developers take advantage of those curved edges).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s got the processing brains to match its beauty, as well, with an octa-core Exynos 7420 processor, and a <em>massive</em> 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Combine that with that latest version of Android, and the end result is one <em>ludicrously</em> fast and responsive phone.</p>
<p>In fact, this is (as far as we know) the first time we&rsquo;ve seen 4GB of RAM in a phone, so not only is it awesome in and of itself, but it&rsquo;s a tantalising glimpse of the next evolution of smartphones.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the camera, and as the rumours suggested, you&rsquo;re looking at a 16MP camera with loads of extra features (such as optical image stabilisation, video digital imaging stabilisation and HDR), that will let you take utterly beautiful photos.</p>
<p>One new feature that we&rsquo;re blown away by is Live Broadcasting, which lets you livestream what you&rsquo;re up to, feeding straight to YouTube. For video bloggers, journalists and celebs, this could be massive.</p>
