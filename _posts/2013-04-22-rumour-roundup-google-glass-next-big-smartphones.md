<p><span class="postStandFirst">All the big news and rumours from the smartphone and tech world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5538 aligncenter" alt="Google Glass" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-01-at-16.34.56.png" width="897" height="360" /></p>
<h2>Google Glass</h2>
<p>The long-awaited Google Glass project has finally been given some specs. Just to re-cap, Google Glass is a wearable computer unit, akin to a pair of glasses, which displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format! The unit is said to contain a 640 x 360 resolution display, which Google has stated will be the equivalent of a 25 inch HD screen from eight feet away. There is a built-in 5 megapixel camera with 720p video recording, 16GB of storage as well as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. Google glass will work with any Android phone running 4.0.3 and above, via the upcoming My Glass app.</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 3</h2>
<p>Rumours are rife about the upcoming next generation phablet, the successor to the Samsung Galaxy Note II. We can expect a metal-cased unit, following in the trend of phones such as the beautiful HTC One with its stunning aluminium unibody design. The handset will more than likely follow the design of the Samsung Galaxy S4 but feature brushed metal and promises to be a real looker. Cue, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3?</p>
<h2>Apple iPhone</h2>
<p>Rumours circulating the latest iteration of the iPhone, possibly to be named the 5S if following the pattern of previous new handset launches, suggest that the handset will house a 12 megapixel camera that will have better lowlight capabilities as well as HDR support. It could also house a new chipset, potentially run iOS 7 and may contain fingerprint scanning technology.</p>
<h2>Nokia EOS</h2>
<p>It has been rumoured for some time that Nokia is working on a hybrid superphone, taking the Lumia 920 technology and combining it with the massive 41 megapixel sensor found in the PureView 808 device. The Nokia EOS is expected to be running on the Windows Phone platform and will feature an HD display as well as a dual or quad-core processor.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for more rumour roundups!&nbsp;</strong></p>
