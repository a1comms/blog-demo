<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Give your Samsung Galaxy S7 edge the protection it deserves.</span></p>
<p>Since Samsung ditched the plastic, its premium range of smartphones have become more sumptuous than ever, but notably more delicate too.</p>
<p>Fashioned largely from a blend of metal and glass, they&rsquo;re of course more susceptible to cracking when dropped. That&rsquo;s just a sad reality we have to accept, but, let&rsquo;s face it, plastic just doesn&rsquo;t look or feel good enough anymore.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to live in fear of damaging your smartphone, not when there are so many trendy yet protective cases on the market to choose from.</p>
<p>To help you find the right one for you, we&rsquo;ve complied five of the best Samsung Galaxy S7 edge cases from Amazon, each with a different style or edge to them. Take a look below.</p>
<h2>1) Clear Shock-Absorbent Hard Case by Ringke</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to cover up Samsung Galaxy S7&rsquo;s naturally stunning design, but conscious of keeping it safe from peril? This clear-view case offers all the protection you need, whilst preserving the original look of your device.</p>
<p>Ultra-slim and ultra-light, it comes equipped with all the necessary cut-outs for full access to buttons and ports, and dust caps help keep unwanted grime&nbsp;from clogging up your charging slot and audio jack.</p>
<p>Unlike some Samsung Galaxy S7 edge cases, this one doesn&rsquo;t just shield the rear and sides, but goes as far as preventing damage to the display too, thanks to a protective front cover.</p>

<h2>2) Slim Leather Wallet Style Case by CoziCase</h2>
<p>This is a stylish, but durable choice that offers protection and shock resistance to your Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, looking after the back and corners especially.</p>
<p>A wallet slot, featured on the rear of the case, will accommodate your essential and frequently used cards, as well as cash notes. If you can get by day-to-day with the bare minimum, this case could quite easily replace your wallet. I switched to a wallet phone case and haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>
<p>Whilst the leather <em>is</em>&nbsp;synthetic, rather than genuine, you can&rsquo;t complain at the vintage style or the extremely modest price tag attached to it.</p>

<h2>3) Protective S View Case Cover by Samsung</h2>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s official S View case for the Galaxy S7 edge is one of the more premium accessories on the market, made from high-grade polyurethane that feels like true quality in your hands. It&rsquo;s soft to touch and you might find rubbing your finger across the texture oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>The shell-like design not only looks great, but provides the much-needed protection to both sides of your Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. The unique front cover window, however, exposes part of your display, and lets you answer calls, snap photos and manage your music without opening the case.</p>

<h2>4) Dual Layer Premium Bumper Case by Spigen</h2>
<p>This case equips your Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with not one, but two layers of protection, in the form of a shock-absorbing TPU case and polycarbonate bumper. Once the flexible TPU cover&rsquo;s in place, the bumper clips right on top.</p>
<p>A tactile design gives you a better, securer grip of your smartphone, which should help minimise the chances of it slipping out of your hand, for a heart-stopping descent. And the slim build of the case means the natural slimness of your Galaxy S7 edge isn&rsquo;t compromised.</p>
<p>Of course, even with the case firmly in place, all the essential ports and buttons are still accessible. You won&rsquo;t ever have to let the guard down.</p>

<h2>5) Premium Leather Flip Case by SLEO</h2>
<p>With a high-quality, handcrafted 100% leather design, this is perhaps my favourite Samsung Galaxy S7 edge case out there.&nbsp;I love the low profile that maintains the device's slim build.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that tiny holes have been drilled through the leather front cover, permitting call sound to flow freely even when the case is closed. A cut out allows your camera to operate as normal. And the power button and ports are left exposed for quick and easy access.</p>
<p>With four and half stars on Amazon, it can&rsquo;t be half bad.</p>
