<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Because ignoring messages shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard!</span></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re something of a chataholic, the chances are that there&rsquo;s one app you just can&rsquo;t live without. While many messaging apps have been launched over the last few years, WhatsApp is by far the most popular, offering voice calls, group messages, and a whole range of other treats. Still, no app on the planet is perfect and there are a few teeny-tiny annoyances we all find with this one.</p>
<p>If you want to take your messaging game to the very next level (who doesn&rsquo;t?), there are some really simple hacks that you can use along the way. Here to transform you into the WhatsApp genius you deserve to be, are just six little tricks you simply have to try for yourself. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>1) How to Get Rid of Those &lsquo;Read&rsquo; Ticks</h2>
<p>Picture the scene. You get a pesky message from your pal nagging you about something or other. You&rsquo;re out and about, but the minute you open that message, you know you have to answer. Why? Well, because she&rsquo;s seen that you&rsquo;ve read it already. Urgh. This is perhaps one of the most irritating things about WhatsApp. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a seriously easy way to solve the problem. Just got to Settings>Account>Privacy>Read Receipts and turn them off. That way, no one knows whether you&rsquo;ve read their messages or not. Mwahaha&hellip; sneaky!</p>

<h2>2) Send a Message via Siri</h2>
<p>If you happen to have an iPhone, you&rsquo;ll likely have spent many a frustrated hour just trying to get Siri to understand simple commands. What you may not realise is that Siri can actually partner with many apps on your phone, including WhatsApp. Hurrah! By using the command &ldquo;Send a WhatsApp to&hellip;&rdquo; you can speak your message and have Siri type it for you. Well, at least it&rsquo;s useful for something.</p>
<h2>3) Mute Your Group Chats</h2>
<p>Group chats are useful when it comes to making plans with your pals and the like. Still, some people out there (we won&rsquo;t name names!) tend to abuse this function. When a group chat has turned into nothing more than inane &lsquo;banter&rsquo;, it can be utterly infuriating. You may not know it, but you can actually mute the chat. Open the chat and hit the settings button in the top right corner. You can then mute the chat for a period of your choosing from eight hours to a whole year.</p>

<h2>4) Use WhatsApp on Your&nbsp;PC</h2>
<p>Gone are the days when you could only use WhatsApp on your smartphone. Both Windows and Mac have WhatsApp apps that you can download and use while you work. To sync your phone app to your computer app, you simply need to scan the QR code (yes, some people still use them) on the computer app, using your smartphone. The apps pull through all your old chats too so you have everything you need at your fingertips. This little hack is perfect if you want to carry on chatting while pretending to be busy at work.</p>
<h2>5) Stop Nosy People from Snooping in Your Chats</h2>
<p>When a WhatsApp message pops up on your iPhone, literally anyone can peek over your shoulder and take a look at what it says. If, say, you&rsquo;re chatting about what you&rsquo;re getting your partner for Christmas and they see this, it could be an utter disaster. So, how do you stop the messages from flashing up on your locked screen? Well, it&rsquo;s really very easy! Just go to Settings>Notifications>Show Preview. With one click of a button, you can switch from previewed messages to basic alerts. Phew!</p>

<h2>6) Broadcast a Message to Your Friends</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you want to say the exact same thing to a load of people but you don&rsquo;t want them all to end up in a group chat. Let&rsquo;s say, you&rsquo;re planning a party but want to send individual messages to your friends inviting them, so that they feel as though they&rsquo;re special. Well, you can do just that - and you don&rsquo;t even have to bother copying and pasting the text! In the menu tab, you should find a &lsquo;New broadcast&rsquo; option. Simply tap this, choose your recipients, and type away. When you press send, each of your contacts will get an individual message as though you&rsquo;ve just sent it to just them. Perf!</p>
