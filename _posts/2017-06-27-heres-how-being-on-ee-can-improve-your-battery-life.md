<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Mobile signal can affect your battery life. Here's how.</span></p>
<p>When your phone runs out of battery, it can be nothing short of a nightmare. Whether you're just about to book an Uber, or you're deep into a juicy WhatsApp conversation, seeing your battery icon slip into the red is the worst. Luckily, if this problem is happening to you more and more, there could be an unexpected way to fix it.</p>
<p>You may think that your phone signal and your battery have nothing to do with one another, but that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong. In truth, these two are related in a way that you may never, ever have imagined&hellip;</p>
<p>How are the two related? Well, your smartphone uses a load of battery when <em>finding </em>a network signal. In fact, when you lose signal, your phone surges its power above normal levels to find it again, draining quicker and quicker if you can't get coverage!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14120" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U3djnuZSd0tp6y41YJv2AZ1EwGh2m_1NczNcjzxPDWjZJWIxGriUn0F4XMHo8_eboLLmM_HmsPOl26y_IkclaoVy=s0" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>If this happens all-too-often, you could find that running out of power becomes something of a regular occurrence. That means that you need to make 100% sure that your provider offers a decent level of coverage, <em>if </em>you want to avoid killing your battery.</p>
<h2>Turn Your Battery into a Beast with EE</h2>
<p>So, how can <a href="https://www.buymobiles.net/ee" target="_blank">EE</a> network coverage help you along the way? Well, it&rsquo;s simple. You may have heard claims that EE has the best mobile coverage in the UK. As it happens, those rumours are true.</p>
<p>In fact, at the end of 2016, uSwitch reported that EE was &ldquo;best-known for offering the UK's widest and fastest 4G coverage&rdquo;. That should come as no great surprise given that it has more masts than any other network in the country. EE has invested heavily in this area of business, meaning that customers get an incredible level of service no matter where they happen to live.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not all. Aside from keeping signal across loads of UK locations, you can also be certain that the 4G connectivity you get will be strong. The 4G network that EE offers boast speeds of up to 60Mbps around large parts of the country, and even faster speeds in the likes of central London, peaking at a whopping 150Mbps.</p>
<p>All the above means that choosing EE as your mobile phone provider will help you save your battery power when you need it the most. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy a fantastic level of service across the country. It really is a win-win situation!</p>
