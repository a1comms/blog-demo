<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Want to get a better night&rsquo;s sleep? Number 18 is the iPhone secret you need.</span></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve likely heard the myth that we humans only use 10% of our brain&rsquo;s capacity. Well, perhaps the same could be said for our iPhones.</p>
<p>You might not realise it now but there are loads of iPhone secrets and hidden features you can unlock with just the click of a button. Here are just 20 that you really ought to know!</p>
<h2>1) Switch to a Desktop Site</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13100" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/iphone-request-desktop-site-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>While most websites tend to work fairly well on mobile devices, like Buymobiles.net for example, some can be a little glitchy now and then.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble seeing a particular page, hold down the refresh button (located top right in in the URL bar). That prompts the option to &lsquo;Request Desktop Site.&rsquo; Simple.</p>
<h2>2) Reach Your Top Icon Row</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13093" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/reach-top-of-screen.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a larger iPhone (i.e. one of the Plus models), and you like using it one-handed, this hidden feature will be extremely useful. By double tapping (<em>not</em> <em>clicking</em>) the home button, your display drops down, so you can reach the content at the top more easily.</p>
<h2>3) Turn on focus lock in your camera</h2>
<p>Fancy yourself a budding photographer? Then you will love this particular iPhone secret. Tap where you want to focus on the screen and hold down. AE / AF Lock will appear at the top of the screen, which means that the focus has been locked. Genius.</p>
<h2>4) Delete Those Annoying Red Bubbles</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13091" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/remove-notification-bubble.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Are you a particularly popular person? Do you get about a million notifications a day? If you answered yes to both of those questions, you <em>need </em>to learn this next iPhone secret, because you&rsquo;re no doubt sick of those little red notification bubbles sat on top of your app icons.</p>
<p>Go to Settings > Notifications, locate the offending app, then toggle off Badge App Icon.</p>
<h2>5) Read Your Voicemails</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but listening to awkward voicemails makes me seriously anxious. The next time that your aunt May has left you a long message, you can read it rather than listen to it.</p>
<p>FYI, this hidden feature only works on O2 or EE. If you&rsquo;re on O2, call 1750 to activate <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/how-to-set-up-visual-voicemail-on-your-iphone" target="_blank">visual voicemail</a>, and if you&rsquo;re on EE, you should text &lsquo;iPhone Visual&rsquo; to 150.</p>
<h2>6) Create Emoji Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Finding the right emoji is crucial to any adult conversation. But what should you do if you can&rsquo;t be bothered to sift through all the different icons to find the one you need? Well, you can create an emoji shortcut for some of your favourite ones by going to Settings > General > Keyboard >Text Replacement.</p>
<h2>7) Add Cool Effects to Your Texts</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8KOu4hAgpY" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Want to make iMessage just a <em>little </em>more interesting? Well, by pressing down on the arrow to the right of the text using 3D Touch, you can add some cool effects. For example, you might want to include Invisible Ink or a Loud effect.</p>
<h2>8) Speed Dial Your Favourite Contacts</h2>
<p>3D Touch the Phone icon and a list of your four favourite contacts will pop up (these are the four people that you message or call the most, so not necessarily your favourite). Changing them could not be easier. Just go to into the Phone app > Favourites > Edit. This has to be one of the easiest hidden features.</p>
<h2>9) Find Out Who&rsquo;s Calling with Announcements</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to bother looking at your iPhone to find out who&rsquo;s calling? No worries. You can make your device announce caller identity with this secret feature. Go to Settings > Phone > Announce Calls. The next time your iPhone rings, it&rsquo;ll read out the contact.</p>
<h2>10) Set a Regular Bedtime Schedule</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13092" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/bedtime-mode.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>We all need to get more sleep, and now your iPhone can help you do just that. Going to bed at the same time each night can help you regulate your circadian rhythms and improve your health. Just got to the Clock app and choose a bedtime and a wakeup time each day. Your phone will remind you when it&rsquo;s time to sleep (like the nag that it is!) and wake you up in the morning.</p>

<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13103" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/iphone-secrets.png" alt="" width="800" height="420" /></h2>
<h2>11) Take Photos When Shooting a Video</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when you&rsquo;re shooting a video, you see a frame that would make the perfect snap. What do you do? Well, by pressing the circle button in the bottom of the screen, you can take a picture without disrupting the recording.</p>
<h2>12) Move Your Cursor with 3D Touch</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13096" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/move-cursor-iphone.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>It can be seriously frustrating when you&rsquo;re typing a message and find that you&rsquo;ve messed it up. And sometimes when you&rsquo;re trying to place the cursor next to the typo, you can&rsquo;t quite get it in the right spot. The easy way is to force press the keyboard, using 3D Touch, and slide the cursor to any point.</p>
<h2>13) Take Pictures Using Your Headphones</h2>
<p>Obviously, this hidden iPhone feature only works if you have a pair of headphones plugged in&hellip;. When you&rsquo;re in camera mode, press either the volume up or down button and your iPhone will take a picture. Nice.</p>
<h2>14) Access the Secret Spirit Level</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13097" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/spirit-level-iphone.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can use your iPhone when you&rsquo;re doing a cheeky bit of DIY around your home. You&rsquo;ve probably never, <em>ever</em> bothered with the compass app, but if you swipe left when you&rsquo;re in it, you&rsquo;ll discover a secret spirit level. Ideal for when you&rsquo;re next putting up shelves!</p>
<h2>15) Search for Specific Words in Safari</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re reading something on a desktop computer, it&rsquo;s super easy to search for certain words or phrases in the text. We all know the good old &ldquo;Ctrl +F&rdquo; trick. When using your iPhone, though, you need to type the word you want into the bar at the top and select &lsquo;Find&rsquo; then &lsquo;On This Page&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>16) Filter Out Calls You Don&rsquo;t Want</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13095" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/do-not-disturb-iphone-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Either you&rsquo;re focusing at work, or you&rsquo;re in bed trying to sleep, and you don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed on the phone. Unless it&rsquo;s a particular person, like your partner or kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Do Not Disturb mode&rsquo;s for. With it enabled, your phone will keep silent, unless you allow calls from particular contacts, or enable repeated calls (i.e. if the same contact calls you more than once within three minutes). Go to Settings > Do Not Disturb, and configure the options to your liking.</p>
<h2>17) Create More Secure Passwords</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13098" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/secure-password-iphone.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Coming up with a so-called &lsquo;secure&rsquo; password is a lot harder than it sounds. Luckily, this iPhone secret feature means that your device will do all the hard work for you. When you&rsquo;re creating a new account for something, simply ask Siri to create a random password for you. Your iPhone will even remember the new, secure password for you.</p>
<h2>18) Get a Better Night&rsquo;s Sleep</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13099" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2017/02/night-shift-mode-iphone.png" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Are you guilty of reading things on your phone when you&rsquo;re in bed? Well, you&rsquo;re not alone - most of us tend to do this before we sleep. Still, that pesky old blue light can actually stop you getting the rest you need. Head to Settings > Display and Brightness to schedule Night Shift, to get your iPhone to filter the blue light out. Happy snoring!</p>
<h2>19) Check What Time Your Message Sent</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in iMessage, you might want to figure out when certain texts were sent. For example, when your mate says he&rsquo;ll &lsquo;be over in five,&rsquo; you can prove it if he&rsquo;s late. Hold press and hold the message in question, then drag it to the right. Doing so will reveal timestamps for each text.</p>
<h2>20) Hide your message previews</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying when a message pops up on your phone and your mate looks over your shoulder to read it. Um, what?! If you want to stop people being so nosey, here&rsquo;s one of the best hidden iPhone features for you. Just go to Settings > Notifications > Messages and then turn off the &lsquo;Show Preview&rsquo; function. Now, no one will ever be able to snoop again!</p>
