<p><span class="postStandFirst">Android Pay has begun its big roll-out in the USA. With security as one of its core features, will this be the service that finally makes mobile payments commonplace? We will soon find out...</span></p>
<p>Mobile payments have been a-comin&rsquo; over that horizon for what feels like <em>ages</em>, now, although it&rsquo;s not really any closer to replacing the traditional act of actually giving the shopkeeper physical money, but the concept is slowly gaining traction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gaining a little bit more traction today, because according to the official Android blog, the roll-out of Android Pay has begun!</p>
<p>By now, there can&rsquo;t be many people reading this who aren&rsquo;t already at least a <em>little</em> bit familiar with the idea of mobile payments. That technology hasn&rsquo;t changed in the slightest; it&rsquo;s still based around NFC, you still put your phone near the NFC receiver at the checkout, and Bobs&rsquo;s your uncle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s changing is the infrastructure, with Android Pay aiming to put a standardised payment service in place, similar to what Apple wants to do with Apple Pay.</p>
<p>The whole service centres around the Android Pay app (and if you use Google Wallet, it will be getting updated to Android Pay soon); it stores your credit and debit card info, and takes payment from whichever one you select, when you shove your phone near the NFC terminal in the shop.</p>
<p>The whole process is very, very simple, and Google has put security front and centre, to help allay people&rsquo;s fears about mobile payments (in the form of a virtual account number, instead of sending your card info direct to the shop&rsquo;s NFC terminal).</p>
<p>There is one slight catch, however, if you want to use Android Pay while living in the UK: this roll-out is, for the moment, only happening in the USA.</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s currently no word on when it will reach these shores, but we shall be watching this one closely, so stay tuned for more news! </strong></p>
