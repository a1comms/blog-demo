<p>Have you got yourself a brand-new Huawei Mate 20 Pro? Lucky you! One of the best things about this flagship phone is the triple-lens camera. You&rsquo;re probably ready to get snap-happy and start taking some pictures. Here are some photography tips to help you.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwsVKoyXZb4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>1) Use Night Mode in the Day</h2>
<p>Why not bend the rules here? Go ahead and use Night Mode when you&rsquo;re taking pictures in the daytime.</p>
<p>The feature takes a whole variety of shots in one blast and then blends them all together to make one photo.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the feature brings out as much light as possible in every shot, which is why it&rsquo;s supposed to be used in the dark. However, when you use it during light hours, it gives you a really cool, unique look.</p>

<h2>2) Take Rad Pictures with Bokeh Effects</h2>
<p>When you first get a Huawei Mate 20 Pro, you&rsquo;ll want to play around with some of the effects that you can use here.</p>
<p>One such effect is the bokeh feature, which makes the background of your pictures blurry while the subject remains clear in the foreground.</p>
<p>To use this effect, you need to shoot using Portrait Mode. Next, you can choose from circles, hearts, swirls and discs to alter the image. Give it a go!</p>
<h2>3) Try the Mono Shooting Mode</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19746" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZAi1LJTTJtKCwSmfQfQ2RQ7ZUavG2kpYfco77q1n6_84oXx21Vkjdt5Q7KIRtz9AMCehkry1h72ymkdowoAK4lqlZw=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mono sensor in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Mono Shooting mode is no longer useful.</p>
<p>You can unlock this mode by heading to the main display, then going to &lsquo;More&rsquo; and then hitting &lsquo;Monochrome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The feature means that you can take suave, moody photos in black and white. Take things up a notch by using Aperture mode at the same time. You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>
<h2>4) Add Some Colour to Your Videos</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19747" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QYckTZLrrVHHQv2iH42BYBwHfHpkvcUKtTJbH87Zz0dN6f-9ySlTG3lxCZ6Ry4yKUJKA7f8lmDh37mP9SE0wjfoF=s0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fancy making your videos really pop? Of course, you do! The AI Portrait Colour feature is a super cool one that you need to know about.</p>
<p>Basically, you can make the background of your videos grey and dull. That means that the main event &ndash;&nbsp;i.e. the people &ndash; in the clip stand out and look far more colourful than before. It&rsquo;s a pretty neat trick to give a whirl.</p>
<h2>5) Use Filters to Add Atmosphere to Your Videos</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve filmed a short clip, there&rsquo;s a quick way that you can jazz it up. Using the AI Cinema Effects, you can add some awesome filters to your videos.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a whole range of filters from which to choose, including blurred ones, vintage ones, and suspenseful ones. You&rsquo;re going to want to experiment here. Take your pick.</p>
