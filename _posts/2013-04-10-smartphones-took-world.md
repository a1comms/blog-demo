<p><span class="postStandFirst">A huge number of smartphones are sold every year, numbering easily into the many tens of millions, so it&rsquo;s fair to say that in the modern mobile market, smartphones are an incredibly important piece of the puzzle, phenomenal performers like the iPhone 5 or the massively anticipated, Android-powered Samsung Galaxy S4 being some of the most talked about and desirable gadgets ever made.</span></p>
<p>But where did they come from? How did the story of the smartphone begin, and how did they reach such colossal heights?</p>
<h2>The early years - smartphones in a pre-iPhone world</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, there&rsquo;s a common misconception that needs to be cleared up; the iPhone was very definitely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the first smartphone. It may well have&nbsp;<em>popularised</em>&nbsp;smartphones, and there&rsquo;ll be more about that in a second, but it wasn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;<em>first</em>; that honour goes to the much earlier IBM Simon. However, the IBM Simon completely failed to set the world alight, so the first&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;intrusion of smartphones into the global mobile market was in 2003.</p>
<p>Two manufacturers dominated the smartphone arena in the days before the first iPhone, and those two companies were Nokia and, as Sony was known at the time, Sony Ericsson. Both of them produced smartphones, the Nseries in the case of Nokia and the P-Series in the case of Sony Ericsson, and both companies used versions of Symbian as their go-to smartphone OS.</p>
<p>At the same time, Microsoft was offering Windows Mobile as a platform, and it featured in some standout phones, most made by, it has to be said, HTC. But then, in 2007, something happened, which changed the smartphone market forever.</p>
<p>That something was the iPhone.</p>
<h2>The golden years - smartphones in a post-iPhone world</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.swayaminfotech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/iphone-2g.jpg" width="600" height="350" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the iPhone wasn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;smartphone, what it did do was&nbsp;<em>popularise</em>&nbsp;them. Before Apple&rsquo;s first mobile phone, the smartphone was seen as something a little bit&nbsp;<em>nerdy</em>, as something that wasn&rsquo;t really made for the likes of the average man and woman on the street. The iPhone changed all that; it made smartphones&nbsp;<em>cool</em>, and desirable, in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It certainly had a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;effect on the mobile industry. The fledgling Android OS, for example, had been in development since before the advent of the iPhone, but in its early forms, it was much more like&nbsp;<em>old</em>&nbsp;versions of Blackberry OS, designed around using arrow keys and moving cursors. After Apple unveiled the iPhone, which really did light a rocket under the phone industry, Android changed to become the touch-optimised beast we know and love today.</p>

<p>One&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t play down the importance of Android in this modern mobile market. If the iPhone made smartphones cool, Android made them into a force that would come to&nbsp;<em>dominate</em>&nbsp;the mobile industry, with a seemingly unbeatable double-header of magnificent top-end phone such as the Sony Xperia Z, and brilliant,&nbsp;<em>affordable</em>&nbsp;mid-range phones like the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, smartphones are serious business, but there&rsquo;s a very good reason for that; whether you&rsquo;re looking at the latest, shiniest iPhone or Android superphone, or a mid-ranger running Android or Windows Phone, the simple truth is that smartphones are&nbsp;<em>awesome</em>!&nbsp;</strong></p>
