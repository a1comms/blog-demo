<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">No, it&rsquo;s not just the &lsquo;same&rsquo; as Siri!</span></p>
<p>The launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus brings with it a whole new AI feature; Bixby. Now, you may well have heard a whole load of rumours about this, Siri&rsquo;s main competitor, but how much do you <i>really </i>know about it? Luckily, we have all the information you could possibly need right here, right now.</p>
<h3>How to use Bixby</h3>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s talk about how you actually use Samsung&rsquo;s latest AI function. Well, you get Bixby to pop up, you simply have to long-hold a button on the side of the Samsung Galaxy S8 or indeed S8 Plus. That should launch the feature. Failing that, you can also say &lsquo;Wake word&rsquo; (or a phrase of your choice) and your phone should access the AI right away.</p>
<p>You will then have access to the three essential parts of this AI; Bixby Home, Bixby Voice, and Bixby Vision. The general idea is that each of these features will help you with some fundamental problem, whether it&rsquo;s controlling your phone or merely checking the weather. So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what each of these elements actually has to offer.</p>
<h3>Bixby Voice</h3>
<p>Well, first of all, it might be helpful to talk about what Bixby does <i>not </i>do. Of course, people are always going to compare this phone to the likes of Siri, but there are actually a few striking differences. Right now, you can&rsquo;t ask the phone AI for general information such as things that you will find on Google. For example, if you want to know what films are out this week, you will have to search the standard way using your keypad.</p>
<p>However, what Samsung&rsquo;s Bixby lacks in general information, it makes up in other areas. One of the key things that you can do using this AI is control your phone&rsquo;s settings. That means that you can literally <i>tell </i>your device to change its brightness or even volume. What&rsquo;s more, you can access many of the main Samsung apps using the Voice Command system as well.</p>
<p>Samsung say that &ldquo;at launch, Bixby&rsquo;s Voice function will integrate with several Samsung native apps and features including Camera, Contacts, Gallery, Messages and Settings, with the plan to expand its capabilities to include more Samsung and third-party apps in the near future.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s not all. You can also use the system to change the image on your wallpaper, access the &lsquo;rotating pictures&rsquo; feature, and stream videos to your smart TV. Nice.</p>
<h3>Bixby Home</h3>
<p>The Bixby Home screen is where you can access a whole load of useful information. From the weather reports to local news, there should be a tailored array of information for you. (You should note that this screen is in essence an updated version of either Samsung Briefing or Upday.) So, while it&rsquo;s not anything particularly revolutionary, it should prove kind of useful to the average tech lover.</p>
<p>Plus, you can choose what&rsquo;s on the screen at any given time. Each of the information cards has a function similar to that of widgets. What that actually means is that you can &lsquo;toggle&rsquo; each piece of information on or off and decide whether you see it on the Bixby Home screen.</p>
<p>Cards that you may want to toggle on your personal Bixby Home screen include the S Health step counter (for the health conscious), a calendar, content from the likes of YouTube, a Facebook card, and an alarm clock. The idea is that you design the screen to suit your needs and have the information available at the touch of a button.</p>
<h3>Bixby Vision</h3>
<p>One of the most exciting things about the whole Bixby AI has to be the Vision function. You can use this feature by hitting the &lsquo;eye&rsquo; icon at the top of the Bixby Home screen. Right away, you will find that the AI accesses your camera and opens a new screen.</p>
<p>You can then point your camera at pretty much anything and it will give you relevant information about it. For example, you could point it at a particular product, and you will instantly have a comparison of prices for the product and where you can buy it. What&rsquo;s more, if you hit the &lsquo;Shopping&rsquo; button, you should be able to search for similar products.</p>
<p>Bixby Vision also uss character recognition. That means that you should be able to point the camera at some text and the AI will convert it into a digital copy for your phone. How useful that will be in the long run is still to be seen, but you have to admit that it sounds cool and futuristic right now.</p>
<h3>The future of Bixby</h3>
<p>Of course, all of the above is available right now, but Samsung will likely want to expand on what the AI offers in the future. It&rsquo;s likely that Bixby will soon link and work in sync with a &nbsp;range of third-party apps, offering a more well-rounded service. Watch this space!</p>
