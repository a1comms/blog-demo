<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it &ndash;&nbsp;the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 devices are set to be some of the most exciting new smartphones of 2019.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re itching to find out more about the phones, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at the latest rumours.</p>
<h2>Completely New Redesign</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting Samsung Galaxy Note 10 rumours is that the phone will have a complete redesign.</p>
<p>The code name for the new devices is &lsquo;Da Vinci&rsquo; according leaks <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/this-samsung-note-10-leak-points-to-a-reinvention-of-the-note-range" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by T3</a>. That mysterious name could give us a clue about the style of the new phones. Could it mean that this is set to be Samsung&rsquo;s most creative smartphone yet?</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;re not sure what the phone will look like exactly. Despite this fact, fans of Samsung have been quick to offer up suggestions. For example, DBS Designing put together a remarkable concept for the phone. Check it out here:</p>

<h2>Two Smartphones</h2>
<p>Could there be two versions of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10? One of the latest rumours suggest so.</p>
<p>According to a leak published on <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/04/12/exclusive-galaxy-note-10-model-numbers-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SamMobile</a>, the two model numbers will be &ndash; SM-N970 and SM-N975. Of course, this information has not been verified by Samsung.</p>
<p>However, this rumour could mean that there are two variations planned for release.</p>
<h2>Huge Handsets</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve noticed something of a trend. Samsung&rsquo;s latest designs have always been about large handsets and a screen-heavy look.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the chances are that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will follow suit. While there haven&rsquo;t been any significant rumours surrounding the size of the device, we can expect it to be larger than the Note 9.</p>

<h2>Awesome Camera Setup</h2>
<p>The same leak may also give us a small insight into the phones&rsquo; cameras.</p>
<p>The smaller Samsung Galaxy Note 10 SM-N97 model could have a triple lens setup on the back of the device.</p>
<p>With the other larger device &ndash;&nbsp;the SM-N975 &ndash; potentially sporting four lenses on the back. As though that weren&rsquo;t enough, we may also see improvements to the zoom function. Samsung recently bought <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/samsung-note-10-in-line-for-this-galaxy-s10-beating-mega-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corephotonics</a>, who happen to excel in this area.</p>

<h2>New Exynos Chipset</h2>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re already wondering what kind of power the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will have.</p>
<p>While we could well see the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 or Exynos 9820 chipset inside the device, there is another option.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/01/21/samsung-rumored-to-announce-exynos-9825-processor-in-h2-2019-may-power-the-galaxy-note-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GizmoChina post</a>, we may see the release of the brand new Exynos 9825 chip later this year. That could well mean that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 devices are powered by the new chipset. Watch this space.</p>
<h2>Galaxy Note 10 Price and Release Date</h2>
<p>It certainly looks like history may well repeat itself here. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 was released back in August 2018 and we now have an official date for Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. August 7, 2019.</p>
<p>Get that date in your diary folks!</p>
<p>It's likely that we'll see the device announced and released in the same month, so watch this space Note fans.</p>
<p>When it comes to the price, you can expect it to be similar to the Note 9. Last year, the release price of the premium smartphone was set at &pound;899. That means that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 price could be similar or even higher, if there are significant upgrades.</p>
