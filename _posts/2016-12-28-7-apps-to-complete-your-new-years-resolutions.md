<p>Come the New Year, most people will've promised themselves that 2017 is <em>the </em>year they'll finally get fit and healthy. But isn't that we all promised ourselves this time <em>last</em> year?</p>
<p>You might, after a couple of tiring gym sessions, be tempted to give up again&hellip; Well, what if you had a personal trainer sat in your pocket?</p>
<p>Cassey Ho is the charismatic host of the wildly successful Blogilates YouTube channel. In a series of intensive videos, she shows users just how to get fit and healthy with her unique brand of exercise called POP Pilates.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to exercise in front of a computer screen all the time, though, there are now both Android and iOS apps available loaded with all the video tutorials you could ever need. As if that wasn't enough, you'll also find healthy recipes within the app, as well as a forum where you can chat to other fitness freaks. Getting healthy has never been so easy and fun.</p>

<p>While there are a whole bunch of job site apps out there, Simply Hired is up there with the best. The app basically works as a massive search engine for jobs, browsing through other sites to find you the best possible opportunities.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76BwU3OVaak" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve resolved to save some pennies in 2017, this has to be one of the smartest ways to do so. The world of investing is a confusing and complicated place. That in itself is usually enough to put us mere mortals off the idea of getting involved. Well, that&rsquo;s where Moneybox comes into play. You see, the iOS and Android apps aim to make small-time investing as simple as can be.</p>
<p>The main premise of the app is that it allows you to invest in stocks and shares using your small change. You connect your card to it, and when you buy something like a coffee, it rounds up the cash to the nearest pound and uses the change to make an investment. You get to choose what level of risk you want with your investments, which is a real bonus too. This is a great way to start learning about the world of stocks without losing a significant amount of money if things don't go to plan!</p>

<h2>4) Make New Friends with Huggle</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhuggleapp%2Fvideos%2F1046708762080427%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>When you get to a certain age, expanding your friendship group is anything but easy. Back in school, you were simply pals with someone because you had the same classes as them. In the adult world, alas, things are not so easy. If you&rsquo;re looking to make some new friends in 2017, Huggle is the app for you.</p>
<p>So, what actually is it? Well, Huggle links with your Facebook account and works much like any of the mainstream dating apps, with one small difference. The aim of it is not too &lsquo;hook-up&rsquo; with people, but rather to make some new mates. When setting it up, you need to select a few places, i.e. bars, cafes, restaurants etc., that you go to a lot. After that, the app will match you with people in these places and you can &lsquo;like&rsquo; them or not. If you both like one another, you will be able to chat. Sound familiar?</p>

<h2>5) Learn a Language with Duolingo</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OebgtUjLg4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to preach to you about how enriching it is to learn a foreign language. You know it all already. If you&rsquo;ve yet to master another tongue, there&rsquo;s a little app that just might help you along the way.</p>
<p>Duolingo is an easy-to-use app that opens up a range of languages including French, Spanish, Italian, and German. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded this app onto your iOS or Android device, it&rsquo;s just a case of choosing which language you fancy dabbling in.</p>
<p>Dualingo offers interactive games and quizzes, which make learning new vocab and grammar fun (no, really!). As you progress through the course, things obviously get more and more challenging. That means that you can continually up your lingo game whenever you have some spare time.</p>
<p>Download Duolingo for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Android</a></p>
<h2>6) Shed Your Christmas Weight with MyFitnessPal</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fu9RKqlmD1Q" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, we all add on a few extra pounds over the festive season. Blame it on those delicious mince pies and pigs in blankets! Still, if you&rsquo;re looking to get back down to a healthier size come January, it&rsquo;s not always easy. One of the major issues surrounding weight loss is the fact that many of us have no idea how calorific the food we eat actually is.</p>
<p>The MyFitnessPal app solves just that problem for you, by monitoring the food you eat on a day-by-day basis. First of all, you need to input your personal specifications (weight, height, gender, target weight, and so on). Using the provided data, MyFitnessPal will work out how many calories you should be consuming each day. Every time you have something to eat, log it in the app and it deducts the given calories from your daily allowance. Easy as pie!</p>
<p>Hmmm, pie&hellip;</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEpOF7vUymc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it, 2016 was a stressful year. One we're all moving swiftly on from&hellip;</p>
<p>So, get your stress levels back in check for 2017; meditation and mindfulness is certainly a good place to start. Don&rsquo;t worry if these concepts are new to you, because there&rsquo;s a useful little app that's about to introduce you to them.</p>
<p>Called Headspace, this app helps you unwind and relax in daily 10-minute sessions. During that time, you listen to a recording that talks you through the fine art of mindfulness. All you have to do is listen and engage with what&rsquo;s being said to you.</p>
<p>Once you start dedicating just a faction of your time to de-stressing, you might notice some really positive differences to your mentality. Because if your head&rsquo;s in the right place, everything else in your life feels that much better, too.</p>
