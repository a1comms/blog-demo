<p><span class="postStandFirst">After a successful deployment in the USA, a new job listing indicates that Apple Pay is getting ready to make its grand entrance in the UK (along with the rest of Europe, plus the Middle East, India and Africa). While there is no timescale for it becoming available, it looks like the UK will finally be catching up to the USA in terms of mobile payments.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6173" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2014/12/Apple-Pay-in-action-1024x682.jpg" alt="Apple-Pay-in-action" width="960" height="639" /></p>
<p>When this year&rsquo;s big Apple unveiling took the wraps off both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, one feature that caught the attention of a <em>lot</em> of people was Apple Pay, the Cupertino giant&rsquo;s first foray into the world of NFC-based mobile payments.</p>
<p>At first, the service was only available in the USA, but thanks to the eagle-eyed observers at iClarified, we now know that Apple Pay will soon be coming to the UK.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of a job listing, wherein Apple talks about setting up a new Apple Pay team in London, as the company expands its services to Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (collectively called, in the job description, &lsquo;EMEIA&rsquo;). The job listing itself (now taken down) states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Apple Pay is a new and exciting area in Apple that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. Apple Pay will change the way consumers pay with breakthrough contactless payment technology and unique security features built right into their iPhone 6 or Apple Watch to pay in an easy, secure, and private way. The new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the roll-out of this technology across EMEIA by working with a variety of internal and external partners, including teams in the US where the product will first launch and the EMEIA organisation, as well as Issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The job listing comes after Visa&rsquo;s Pedro Sousa stated that his company was working (in conjunction with Apple) towards bringing Apple Pay to the UK early next year, and it may be that Apple has decided to fast-track these plans, after the recent rumours of Samsung partnering with LoopPay to offer a similar service.</p>
<p>The listing has now been pulled, suggesting either that Apple wasn&rsquo;t ready to publicise the service, or that the vacancy has now been filled.</p>
<p><strong>Either way, and although it will take time to roll out the new service (especially in Europe where it will be subject to extreme scrutiny by regulators, to ensure customers&rsquo; details are completely secure), it does seem like it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until the UK finally gets access to Apple Pay.</strong></p>
