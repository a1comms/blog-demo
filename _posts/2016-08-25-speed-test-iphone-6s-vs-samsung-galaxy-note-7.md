<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Fasten your seat belts. It's&nbsp;about to get real.</span></p>
<p>Just when you thought that the broiling rivalry between Apple and Samsung couldn&rsquo;t burn any hotter, someone decided to fan the flame by pitting the newly announced Samsung Galaxy Note 7 against last year&rsquo;s iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>The latter of which has long stood as the reigning champ in a series of YouTube hosted speed tests, which, we all know, is the deciding platform on any issue. However, with Note 7 yet to even hit the market, because it&rsquo;s <em>that </em>state-of-the-art, it feels like this fight is over before it even gets started&hellip;</p>
<p>Housing a brand spanking new Snapdragon 820 quad-core 64-bit processor, coupled with a chunky 4GB of RAM, it seems safe to presume that the Note 7 will out-muscle the iPhone 6s with ease, which runs on a year-old dual-core A9 chip, with half the total RAM.</p>
<p>On paper, this looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a bloodbath. But there&rsquo;s really only one way to find out.</p>

<p>Well, this is awkward. It turns out that, despite its aging components, iPhone 6s is still the Usain Bolt of the mobile phone industry, out-gunning even the most powerful Samsung device that&rsquo;s so new, you can&rsquo;t yet buy it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s according to David Rahimi&rsquo;s YouTube speed test, at least, which showed iPhone 6s nail the app-loading sequence in 1 minute 21 seconds, compared to 2 minutes 4 seconds for the Note 7.</p>
<p>However decisive you judge the results to be, it emphasises how advantageous it is for iPhones that Apple designs both the hardware and the software for their devices, producing an experience as smooth as Sean Connery's silk pyjamas.</p>
