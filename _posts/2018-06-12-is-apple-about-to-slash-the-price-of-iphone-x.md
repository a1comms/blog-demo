<p>Mobile phone technology has come a long way in the last 10 years, particularly when you look at the devices occupying the top spots. So it&rsquo;s no surprise that they command a healthy price to match.</p>
<p>Case in point, Apple&rsquo;s all-singing, all-dancing iPhone X is the priciest iPhone to date. But, lucky for Apple fans, things might be about to change. We&rsquo;ve heard word through the grapevine (a.k.a. the internet) that it may be getting a price cut.</p>

<p>Online publication <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/apple-to-slash-iphone-x-price-massively" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T3</a> recently reported that there could be a huge change to the pricing of Apple&rsquo;s flagship device: iPhone X. According to a source from TF International Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo, the team behind the mega-brand is planning to slash the price of the phone so that it&rsquo;s more affordable for just about everybody.</p>
<p>Back when the iPhone X launched in November last year, Apple listed the 64GB version with a &pound;999 price tag. However, if the latest rumours are to be believed, Apple will be knocking up to $300 (&pound;225) off. The idea is that when Apple releases a fresh round of iPhone X devices, they&rsquo;ll more affordable.</p>
<p>So, what do we know about the heavily awaited line of new iPhone X modesl? Well, reports suggest that Apple will release not one, but three new iPhone &ndash;&nbsp;a 5.8-inch beauty, a larger 6.5-inch Plus device, and a budget 6.1-inch version. It&rsquo;s all <em>very </em>exciting &ndash; we&rsquo;re sure that you will agree!</p>

<p>The burning question, of course, is how much will these various iPhone X models cost? Will they be affordable and when can we get them? While we&rsquo;re not entirely sure when this new line will hit stores (although September is a strong contender!), we have seen some theories about the price.</p>
<p>The source quoted in T3 suggests that the 5.8-inch iPhone X will cost around &pound;600, the Plus version will be about &pound;680, and the &lsquo;budget&rsquo; phone will cost around &pound;400. Nice.</p>
<p>There will also reportedly be a new fast-charger included in the mix, which means that this is even more of a saving! The theory behind this sudden price drop is that the developers over at Apple have made the production process more refined, and they&rsquo;re now passing that saving right on to the consumers. Watch this space!</p>
