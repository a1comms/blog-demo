<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Enjoy a fresh look News Feed, as Facebook announces big changes.</span></p>
<p>Soon, a new era of Facebook will dawn. If you&rsquo;re an avid News Feed scroller, you&rsquo;re in for something of a surprise. The algorithm that determines what you see on the site is about to change. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<h2>How Will Our News Feed Change?</h2>
<p>While you may not have known it before now, the goal of the Facebook News Feed was set on &ldquo;helping you find relevant content&rdquo;. However, according to <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, that&rsquo;s all about to change. Instead of that honourable goal, the new aim will be to help users &ldquo;have more meaningful interactions&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="facebook-video"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F10156988765141729%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, that means that you will soon see a rather major change in the posts that dominate your News Feed. Right now, the feed is flooded by posts from brands and news publications. Scrolling through, it means that you&rsquo;re more likely to see what dress actress Meghan Markle just wore, rather than your friend&rsquo;s status.</p>
<p>The new algorithm (a.k.a. internet magic) will mean that you see more from your Facebook friends and the groups of which you&rsquo;re a member. The idea is that you engage with other users on the site more than you do the likes of the media or companies.</p>

<h2>Why Is It Changing?</h2>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve likely heard the rumours that social media use is <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/facebook-admits-that-using-it-can-make-you-feel-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad for your health</a>. In a blog post back in November, researchers from Facebook concluded that &lsquo;passive&rsquo; use of the site could have a negative impact on a person&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>This latest change is a direct response to that &ndash; Facebook's way of getting people to engage with other users rather than merely scrolling aimlessly through the News Feed.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said that he wants to encourage users to communicate with one another in a meaningful way. One of the best ways to do that, of course, is to make sure that the posts people see are from other users.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10104413015393571&amp;width=500" width="500" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, the change will mean that there&rsquo;s less media influence on the site, which can only be a positive thing.</p>
<p>In recent years, the powers at Facebook have noticed a significant decline in &lsquo;organic sharing&rsquo; (i.e. users telling people how they feel in statuses or sharing photos of nights out). It&rsquo;s plain to see that the way in which people use the site has changed dramatically since its launch. When users see other people&rsquo;s posts, though, it should lead them to share their own. Or, at least, so the theory goes.</p>
<h2>When Will It Happen?</h2>
<p>This isn't the first time that Facebook has changed the algorithm in a huge way. Back in 2013, the site made efforts to prevent &lsquo;clickbait&rsquo; and only offer users trusted news and information.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s not clear exactly when the changes will come into effect. It&rsquo;s likely to be quite soon, though, and so it&rsquo;s worth paying a little more attention to your News Feed than you usually do.</p>
