<p><span class="postStandFirst">Finally, the age-old question &lsquo;how many iPhones does it take to stop a speeding bullet?&rsquo; has been answered.</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-large wp-image-7305 aligncenter" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/iPhone-6-bullet-1024x540.jpg" alt="<img src=https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2015/07/iPhone-6-bullet.jpg alt=&rdquo;iphone speeding bullet&rdquo;/>" width="960" height="506" /></p>
<p>A YouTuber, who goes by the username EverythingApplePro, has conducted a slightly unsettling field test to determine just how hard-wearing iPhones are.</p>
<p>Wielding an AK-74 (yes, as in the lethal Russian assault rifle), the YouTuber reveals that he&rsquo;s testing &ldquo;the true durability&rdquo; of iPhones, and how many it would take to stop a speeding bullet.</p>
<p>He coolly explains that the weapon in his hands is capable of firing bullets at up to 2,900 feet per second, but even still, he doesn&rsquo;t expect a bullet to penetrate through more than four of the seven iPhones that he&rsquo;s stacked on a wooden holder.</p>
<p>Apple fans, look away now.</p>
<p>Positioned helplessly upon the holder (alter?) for sacrifice, are three iPhone 6 Pluses, two iPhone 6s (one of which is a clone) and two older iPhone variants. Sat smugly at the back is a Samsung Galaxy S6.</p>
<p>The question is, are seven iPhones enough to shield a Samsung Galaxy S6 from the destructive path of speeding bullet? Watch to find out.</p>
