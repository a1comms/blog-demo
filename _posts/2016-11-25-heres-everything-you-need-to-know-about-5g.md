<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Welcome to the future!</span></p>
<p>Forget 3G and 4G; the internet of the dark ages, there&rsquo;s soon to be a brand new system in town. Yep, just when you&rsquo;d gotten used to the ultra-quick speed of 4G, there&rsquo;s talk of a bigger, better, and faster mobile internet. Sigh! We just can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>Since our phones are now packed with more apps than ever and we constantly need to stay connected, there&rsquo;s a very real need for a faster form of mobile browsing. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s not just mobile phones that will be able to use this system; the whole idea with 5G is that it can be used on a variety of handheld (and wearable) devices. Snazzy, huh?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re completely baffled at the very idea of the futuristic-sounding 5G, don&rsquo;t panic. We&rsquo;ve totally got your back on this one! Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the latest generation of mobile internet.</p>
<h2>Is it really any better than 4G?</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikR0_ptc4P4" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In short, yes. You see, at the top end of things, 4G can only go up to one gigabit of speed. What&rsquo;s more, you may often find that your mobile data cuts out when you&rsquo;re in a particularly isolated area or somewhere with a load of tall buildings. If you&rsquo;re an internet and social media addict, this can be something of a nightmare.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the difference with the all-singing, all-dancing 5G then? Well, rumour has it that the top speed for this generation will be around five times that amount. Realistically, that translates to less irritating &lsquo;buffering&rsquo; time and more time spent enjoying all the glories that the net affords you. Genius, right?</p>
<p>Of course, none of the devices that are currently on the market can actually support 5G, which means that we will all need to upgrade before we can enjoy this magically fast internet browsing system. Even the much-acclaimed iPhone 7 is not capable of handling the sheer power of 5G. Sorry, guys.</p>

<h2>When can we get 5G?</h2>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re probably wondering when you can get your little hands on a device with 5G, right? Well, you may have to wait a while - four years to be a little more precise. Yep, it&rsquo;s unlikely that 5G will be standard on devices until the year 2020. We know, it&rsquo;s a super long time to wait for anything! For now, you&rsquo;ll just have to struggle along with your 4G, safe in the knowledge that brighter, faster times are headed your way soon.</p>
