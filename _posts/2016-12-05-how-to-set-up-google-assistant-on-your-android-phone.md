<p>Your Android smartphone comes equipped with your very own personal assistant, always ready to help. Whether you&rsquo;ve got questions to ask, or requests to make. Its name? Google Assistant.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPfQMVf4vwQ" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Just like Siri for iPhones, Google Assistant is capable of all sorts of wonderful things, from searching for the capital of a country, to translating a foreign phrase. You can even ask it to play some music, or book a reservation at your favourite restaurant.</p>
<p>In short, Google Assistant totally rocks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take our word for it, though, try Google Assistant for yourself. All you need to know is how to set it up, and a few other little tips and tricks, and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<h2>How to Turn Google Assistant On</h2>
<p>First thing&rsquo;s first, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure Google Assistant&rsquo;s switched on. To do so, touch and hold the Home button, and when asked if you want to turn Google Assistant on, tap <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>If you want to ever turn Google Assistant off, touch and hold the Home button. In the top right corner, tap More > Settings. Next to Google Assistant, toggle the switch off.</em></p>
<h2>How to Turn &ldquo;OK Google&rdquo; On</h2>
<p>Rather than manually opening Google Assistant every time you want help, you can wake it up by saying &ldquo;OK Google.&rdquo; Turn this setting on by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch and hold the Home button.</li>
<li>Positioned top right, tap <strong>More</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>&ldquo;OK Google&rdquo; detection</strong>.</li>
<li>From this screen you can turn &ldquo;OK Google&rdquo; on using the switch.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Customise Google Assistant</h2>
<p>There are various Google Assistant settings available to tweak , there to better tailor the experience to your individual needs.</p>
<p>Firstly, you can set your home or work location for traffic updates, directions and more. Just hold down the Home button, then at the top right of your screen, tap <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Personal info</strong> > <strong>Home &amp; work locations</strong>.</p>
<p>Less useful, but far cooler is the ability to set a nickname. Google Assistant, ever obedient, will use the nickname you choose whenever it refers to you. Change yours by holding the Home button, followed by <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>info</strong> > <strong>Nickname</strong>.</p>
<p>We all have our preference when it comes to digesting wheather news in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The latter of which means nothing to me, personally. Choose which one Google Assistant presents information in by holding down the Home button, then tap <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>info</strong> > <strong>Weather</strong> <strong>units</strong>.</p>
