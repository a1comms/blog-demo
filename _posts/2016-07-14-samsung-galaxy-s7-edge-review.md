<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">Crafted from curved glass and premium aluminium, the newest Galaxy flagship edges it as the most exquisite Android device out there.</span></p>
<p>Samsung took a major step forward in 2015, with its &lsquo;Project Zero&rsquo; &ndash; the codename for Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. The design language was as different between those devices and previous ones, as English is to Mandarin, using premium materials and a stunning new form factor.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve seen Samsung build from 2015&rsquo;s successes, fine tuning both design and hardware. The results may not be so apparent on the surface, but we assure you, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has drastically improved. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the specifics.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9747" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/UX-768x381.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/UX-768x381.png 768w, https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/UX-768x381-300x149.png 300w" alt="UX-768x381" width="768" height="381" /></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has carried over the aesthetic greatness of its predecessor, improving aspects that aren&rsquo;t immediately noticeable.</p>
<p>But the major update for this department is the IP68 certification that makes the Galaxy S7 edge totally water and dustproof. In the real world, having a waterproof phone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you should bathe with it, but you&rsquo;re not likely to damage it so easily from splashes or getting caught in the rain. Which is always a bonus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9745" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7-hd.png" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7-hd.png 600w, https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7-hd-300x169.png 300w" alt="galaxy-s7-hd" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>One of the standout features on the Galaxy S7 edge is the display, a 5.5-inch Quad HD unit that pops with vibrant colours and sharp visuals. It&rsquo;s up there with the best. If you have a Netflix subscription, or you like streaming TV from apps like iPlayer and 4OD, then you won&rsquo;t find a better device to showcase your content on.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest talking about Samsung Galaxy S7 edge&rsquo;s display are the signature curves, complete with added functionality and support for EDGE applications, which let you perform various actions right from the edge of the screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9743" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_gamaing_handvisual-768x432.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_gamaing_handvisual-768x432.png 768w, https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_gamaing_handvisual-768x432-300x169.png 300w" alt="galaxy-s7_gamaing_handvisual-768x432" width="768" height="432" /></p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>The driving force behind this powerhouse is an Exynos octa-core processor, coupled with a chunky 4GB RAM. Collectively, they empower the Galaxy S7 edge with all the ingredients that make it one of the fastest and most capable smartphones available today.</p>
<p>It can handle everything from multitasking, to demanding apps, to powerful games. All with ease. Providing the much-needed fuel is a sizable 3600mAh battery, giving you enough for day&rsquo;s heavy use.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The primary 12-megapixel camera unit on the Galaxy S7 edge is unique, in that it boasts Dual Pixel technology, which, in terms we all understand, means faster photo taking and enhanced performance in low light.</p>
<p>In addition, the main camera features optical image stabilisation &ndash; for stiller, less blurry &ndash; shots, and a generous range of capture modes. Take a lot of videos? This camera shoots footage in 4K, so your collection of memories look much clearer than they do in your head.</p>
<p>It would be rude to forget the 5-megapixel front-facing camera that&rsquo;s pretty nifty for taking selfies on apps like Snapchat, and especially handy for video calls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9742" src="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_camera_dual_pixel-768x432.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_camera_dual_pixel-768x432.png 768w, https://a1comms-blog-buymobiles.storage.googleapis.com/2016/03/galaxy-s7_camera_dual_pixel-768x432-300x169.png 300w" alt="galaxy-s7_camera_dual_pixel-768x432" width="768" height="432" /></p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S7 edge runs Android 6.0.1 fresh out of the box, though later versions will likely ship with the recently <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/android-nougat-the-latest-and-tastiest-from-google">announced Android 7.0 Nougat</a>.</p>
<p>As is tradition, Samsung has overlain its TouchWiz UK software, introducing features that aren&rsquo;t standard with Android, like EDGE functions, Smart Stay and more. But it&rsquo;s cleaner and more pleasing on the eyes.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Falling into the flagship category, this smartphone delivers all the trimmings, like Quick Charge for faster refuelling; wireless charging capabilities for topping up cable free; a fingerprint scanner to access your stuff quicker, more securely; and a host of connectivity essentials like NFC and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>What totally rocks, though, is that Samsung brought the microSD card back after quietly omitting it from the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. Users can now expand storage space by up to 200GB.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s more than meets the eye with this one. Cynics may only see another Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, but they&rsquo;d be wrong. Okay, the looks haven&rsquo;t moved on much from last year, but did they need to? Probably not when Samsung packed it full of state-of-the-art technology like a phenomenal processor and industry-leading camera, then sealed it all shut with a waterproof case.</p>
<p>For us, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has ticked more boxes than any other smartphone released in 2016. So many boxes, in fact, that it soared straight to the top of our <a href="http://blog.buymobiles.net/features/best-mobile-phones-this-year">Best Mobile Phones &ndash; Summer 2016</a>.</p>
