<p><span class="postStandFirst" style="color: #0896d5; line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;">A new Nokia 3310 is coming. This is <em>not </em>a drill.</span></p>
<p>While we may adore all our new-fangled gadgets, what with their wireless charging and endless apps, there&rsquo;s always room for a little nostalgia. Go ahead, put on your rose-tinted specs, and cast your mind back a mere 17 years, to a much simpler time. A time when tech was oh-so-basic, games were 2D, and ringtones were everything. Back then, there was just one mobile phone we all so desperately loved: Nokia 3310.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there are many wonderful things that we still <a href="https://blog.buymobiles.net/features/15-things-youll-only-remember-if-you-had-a-nokia-3310">remember about the original Nokia 3310</a>. From the epic game that was Snake 2, to the fact that you could create your own ringtone in just a few minutes; there was just so much to love about the original Nokia 3310. Still, if there&rsquo;s one thing that we will never, ever forget about this neat little device, it&rsquo;s how indestructible they were.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been missing the reassuringly robust feel of Nokia 3310 since way back when the Spice Girls originally split, we&rsquo;ve got some rather exciting news for you. You may be able to hold this reliable little handset in the palm of your hand once again. Yes, Nokia will be relaunching a new 3310 at the annual Mobile World Congress 2017 later this month, according to a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2017/02/13/hmd-global-will-launch-the-nokia-3-5-and-6-at-mwc-plus-a-3310-homage/">recent leak</a>.</p>

<p>How much will an updated version of the classic Nokia 3310 set you back? Well, the cost is currently set at a very reasonable &euro;59, which is just around the &pound;50 mark. Of course, this device can&rsquo;t realistically rival the likes of modern-day smartphones, which is quite possibly the reason for the cheap price tag. Let&rsquo;s face it, though, you want a new Nokia 3310 for the pure novelty of it! Possibly as an emergency phone, too, because, we all know these devices will outlive everything else. They&rsquo;re the cockroaches of the smartphone industry.</p>

<p>Oh, and in case you&rsquo;re wondering, the new Nokia 3310 isn&rsquo;t the only Nokia-branded phone set to be unveiled at MWC 2017. HMD Global, the Finnish company that now owns the rights to the Nokia brand, has a few more tricks up its sleeve: the Nokia 3, 5, and 6. While these phones will have much more in common with smartphones than the new Nokia 3310, they&rsquo;re likely to be sold as &lsquo;budget&rsquo; devices, sporting a similarly low price.</p>
